Chipalo Street was raised with his sister by two loving parents in a working-class African American community. He was lucky enough to discover a love of technology at his public school, a passion that pushed him to earn a Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science from Brown University. While at Brown, Street co-founded a start-up in remote cardiac rehabilitation.

After graduating from Brown, Chipalo joined Microsoft where his work starting the Azure IoT Edge product helped direct Microsoft’s approach to edge computing. He has had four patents granted and now works for Microsoft’s Chief Technology Officer as an advisor on emerging technologies.

Recognizing that the education that provided him with such great opportunities was not available right in his own neighborhood, Chipalo co-founded the Teacher Scientist Partnership at Technology Access Foundation Academy. In this role, he developed and taught a computer science curriculum in south Seattle. He has also gives back to his community with the Public Policy Impact Council at the United Way of King County.

In addition to his work at Microsoft, Chipalo started a small real estate company that views rental homes as partnerships between the owner and tenants. Despite around 1/3 of his tenants losing work during the pandemic, he was able to ensure that all of his tenants remained housed.

Chipalo also recently concluded a successful side career as a soccer referee for international, professional, and collegiate matches. He has refed games for the Seattle Sounders, OL Reign, Tacoma Defiance, Portland Timbers, Inter Milan, and Paris Saint Germain!

In the House, he serves as Vice Chair of the Finance Committee as well as on the Environment & Energy and Innovation, Community & Economic Development, & Veterans committees.

Chipalo lives in the Central District in Seattle.
