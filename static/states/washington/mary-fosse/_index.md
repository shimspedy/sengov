State Representative Mary Fosse is the proud mother of two, wife of a veteran, daughter of a single mother, a survivor, and a former small business owner with over a decade of community advocacy experience. She is well-known as a dedicated public servant and proponent of the rights of workers, families, and our most vulnerable. Even before joining the legislature, Rep. Fosse’s volunteer work secured nearly $5.5 million for an environmental justice cleanup project for the historically underserved Delta Neighborhood in Everett.

Representative Fosse brings a vital and unique perspective to the legislative community. Having experienced the trauma of poverty and homelessness as a child, her top priorities include affordable housing, addressing homelessness issues, supporting workers and families, and establishing safe and resilient communities.

Protecting a worker’s right to choose not to participate in forced meetings in the workplace about political, religious, or anti-union agendas without fear of retaliation.
Mary advocated for funding in the 2023-25 biennial budgets that includes investments for Compass Health Broadway Behavioral Health Services, electrification of the Port of Everett, salmon recovery in Tulalip, early learning facilities, the Regional Apprenticeship Pathways (RAP) Program, and cleaning contaminated soils and sites in district.

In the 2024 supplemental budgets, her priorities included securing funding to improve access to childcare with nonstandard hours for working families, addressing dire building conditions in the Marysville School District, and utilizing Climate Commitment Act funding to uplift communities most impacted by climate change.
