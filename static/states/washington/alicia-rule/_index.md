Alicia’s family has called Whatcom County home for five generations. Her great-grandparents immigrated from Holland, and her grandparents owned a farm in Sumas. The daughter of a truck driver who delivered hay to local dairies and a mom who works for PeaceHealth, Alicia is a social worker, mental health professional and small business owner. She has helped families with adoptions, supported children who have experienced abuse and cared for hospice patients.

She was elected to the Legislature in 2020 with a clear mission to represent the most vulnerable among us – our children, youth and struggling young adults. She has sponsored legislation to help children experiencing homelessness, get kids learning outside, and bolster our Main Streets. Throughout the pandemic and various crises in the community, she has worked diligently to provide resources and uplift the voices of those most affected. Alicia is Vice Chair of the Human Services, Youth & Early Learning Committee, and also serves on the Capital Budget and Innovation, Community & Economic Development, & Veterans committees.

Alicia holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Washington and a master’s degree from San Diego State University. She owns a mental health practice and runs this small business while serving in the Legislature. She also served on the Blaine City Council, and launched and served as president of the Blaine Downtown Development Association. Most importantly though, Alicia is the proud mom of three boys and a very active puppy.
