Amy represents the 48th Legislative District, which includes parts of Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland and all of Clyde Hill, Medina, Yarrow Point and Hunts Point. Prior to coming to the Legislature in 2019, Amy served on the Kirkland City Council from 2009 – 2014, until she was selected by her colleagues to serve as Mayor of Kirkland from 2014 – 2019.

As mayor, Amy raised Kirkland’s profile in local, regional and statewide initiatives. Her leadership includes transportation infrastructure and strategic economic development projects which resulted in the revitalization of the Totem Lake Business District. She championed mandatory inclusion of affordable housing in residential developments and enacted an ordinance against source of income-based discrimination for families in Section 8 housing programs.

Her additional accomplishments at the City of Kirkland include gun safety reforms, environmental protections, developing the Cross Kirkland Corridor, and proclaiming Kirkland’s commitment as a welcoming, safe, and inclusive community for all.

Amy was born in Oregon and studied and practiced law in Australia before moving to Kirkland in 2005 with her husband, Jim. Together they own and operate a successful local auto business. She has a consistent record of successfully leading complex organizations through change, including serving as chief financial officer for companies with annual revenues exceeding $150 million for nearly 20 years.

As a cancer survivor and someone who received help during difficult times in her life, Amy is committed to giving back. Amy served as the president of the Sound Cities Association (SCA) in 2018. She received the Advocacy All-Star Award from the Association of Washington Cities (AWC) in 2015 and was awarded Elected Official of the Year from the Alliance of Eastside Agencies in 2013.

Amy lives in Kirkland with her husband. She is a proud stepmother of three and legal guardian to her nephew.
