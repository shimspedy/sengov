Sam is serving his first term representing the 39th Legislative District in the Washington State House of Representatives. The 39th District includes parts of Snohomish and Skagit counties, including parts of Everett and Arlington, Lake Stevens to the southwest, Darrington and Rockport to the north, and parts of Sedro-Woolley and Burlington to the northwest.

Sam was born and raised in Snohomish County. His earliest years were spent in Marysville before moving to Everett.

A graduate of Everett High School, Sam holds two college degrees – a B.A. in Theology and a Master’s Degree in Organizational Leadership from Maranatha Baptist University.

Sam was a successful small business owner for 10 years before shifting to public service. In 2013, he was elected to the Lake Stevens City Council. His peers selected him City Council President in 2016, and he served as Mayor Pro-Tem. During this time, Sam also served on the Snohomish County Board of Health and was unanimously selected as Chair of the Health District in 2015. In 2016, he was elected to the Snohomish County Council—a role he remains in as he serves as state representative.

Sam is active in community service both personally and through his local Lake Stevens Rotary Club where he served as President in 2016 and 2017.

Sam serves on four House committees, including the Transportation Committee where he is an assistant ranking member. He also serves on the Housing Committee, State Government and Tribal Relations Committee, and Rules Committee.  

From replacing the Highway 2 Trestle and widening Highway 9 to addressing housing affordability and supply, Sam’s work on these committees will help address some of the most critical issues facing his neighbors in the 39th Legislative District.

Sam and his wife, Mariah, live in Lake Stevens and have five adult children – Meghan, Caleb, Mercedes, Seth, and Vaden.

Sam is honored to have the opportunity to serve the people of the 39th Legislative District and work to help improve the quality of life and opportunities for all of the people of Washington State.
