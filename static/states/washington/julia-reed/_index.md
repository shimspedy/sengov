Julia grew up in Seattle as the Black and bi-racial daughter of two public school educators who taught her the importance of public service, empathy, hard work and collective action. She attended Summit K-12 and Holy Names Academy, and holds a BA from Smith College and an MPA from Princeton University’s School for Public and International Affairs.

After college, Julia served in the Obama administration, where she worked with the State Department and the Office of Management and Budget. She has worked at the federal level on issues ranging from advancing the Israel-Palestine peace process to building a 21st century government workforce. When she returned to Seattle, she served as a senior policy advisor to the mayor, helping to create a community college internship pipeline for Seattle Promise scholars and connecting them to job opportunities with some of the city’s leading employers. She also led a redesign of the city’s youth employment system and worked to reform the Workforce Development Council.

Today, Julia consults with businesses, school districts, and nonprofits on racial equity, workforce, and economic development issues. She is committed to expanding the skilled workforce Washington needs, with a focus on uplifting underrepresented communities and providing pathways for youth. Julia is also a strong supporter of the arts and the creative economy. As a former member of the Sea Scouts, Julia works hard to uplift the needs of Washington’s maritime industries.

A resident of the Lower Queen Anne/Uptown neighborhood, Julia can usually be seen exploring the city on her electric bike.
