As a working mom with two kids, Tana brings an important perspective to legislative issues. She consistently advocates for issues affecting busy families and seeks upstream solutions to address mental health, economic and environmental justice, and education equity.

As a state representative for the 41st Legislative District, Tana chairs the Human Services, Youth, and Early Learning Committee. She’s also a member of the Appropriations Committee, and Innovation, Community & Economic Development, and Veterans Committees. She also serves as a member of the Joint Legislative & Executive Committee on Behavioral Health and is the co-founder of the Mom’s Caucus, a group of legislators (Moms and Dads!) who care deeply about ensuring our state’s families are supported and given every opportunity to thrive.

After earning her bachelor’s degree in education at Washington University in St. Louis and her master’s degree in public policy and administration from Columbia University, Tana worked for 15 years in government relations and communications in the private, nonprofit and philanthropic sectors before her tenure on the Mercer Island City Council.

Tana serves as co-president of the National Association of Jewish Legislators, as well as on the board of Boys and Girls Clubs of Bellevue and the advisory board of the UW Master’s in Applied Child and Adolescent Psychology program. She previously held board roles with Hopelink, the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle, and the Mercer Island Youth & Family Services Foundation.

She lives with her husband, children and black lab on Mercer Island. During the off season, you can find Tana hiking on one of the numerous trails across the district or enjoying a good meal and glass of wine at one of the local restaurants.
