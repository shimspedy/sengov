#### know more about First Lady Fran DeWine
Mike DeWine and Fran Struewing met in the first grade and married while students at Miami University. They are the parents of 8 wonderful and diverse children, though daughter Becky was tragically lost in an auto accident in 1993. They now have 26 wonderful grandchildren. Fran loves to cook for her family and there is nothing she enjoys more than large family gatherings with aunts and uncles, cousins and grandparents!

Fran has always enjoyed campaigning with Mike and their family. They have a couple of traditions that they have done over the years. The first is the annual Ice Cream Social at their home. Fran and friends have fun making over 150 homemade pies! The second is Fran's Family Favorites Cookbook. It is full of her family's favorite recipes. She passed out the 12th edition of the cookbook -- full of new recipes -- as she visited all 88 counties during the campaign. 

Fran also has a passion for helping children. For the last 18 years, she and the Governor have tried to help some of the poorest children in this hemisphere--the children in the slums of Port au Prince, Haiti. They work with the "Becky DeWine School", named for daughter Becky, to feed and educate the poorest children. The group they work with is called Hands Together. Fran also collects beanie babies and hot wheels cars to send down to these children at Christmas time.
