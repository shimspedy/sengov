Asa Hutchinson is the 46th governor of the State of Arkansas. In 2018, he was re-elected with 65% of the vote, having received more votes than any other candidate for governor in the state's history.

He has won recognition for the state as a leader in computer science education, cut taxes by $150 million, and signed a law that exempts the retirement pay of veterans from state income tax.

President Ronald Reagan appointed Governor Hutchinson as U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. In 1996, he won the first of three successive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. During his third term in Congress, President George W. Bush appointed him director of the Drug Enforcement Administration and later as an undersecretary in the newly created Department of Homeland Security.

His experience has established him as a national resource for his expertise on trade, energy, national security, and education. The governor has been invited to the White House several times to join discussions about health care, Medicaid, and education issues.

The Governor is the current Chair of the National Governors Association. He is the former co-chair of the Council of Governors and the former chairman of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC), Southern States Energy Board (SSEB), and the Southern Regional Education Board.

Governor Hutchinson grew up on a small farm in Gravette. He is a graduate of the University of Arkansas law school. He and his wife, Susan, have been married 48 years. They have four children and seven grandchildren.

## 1. Tax Cut

Continue cutting taxes for ALL Arkansans.
Work with the legislature to lower the top marginal rate to 5.9% over the next four years
Simplify the tax code, close loopholes, and increase fairness for all taxpayers

## 2. Government Transformation

* Reduce the number of agencies that report directly to the governor from 42 to 20 or fewer.
 * This will provide savings and improved services through combined IT systems, eliminated redundancies, streamlined communication, and greater efficiency
 * All with the goal of creating a more efficient, less costly, and more responsive state government

## 3. Teacher Pay

* Raise the minimum starting salary for Arkansas teachers by 13% over the next four years – from $31,800 to $36,000.
 * This will give Arkansas teachers the highest starting salaries in the region

## 4. Ethics Reform

* Governor Hutchinson supports comprehensive ethics reform to ensure that our elected officials are working for the people and with the highest ethical standards.
 * Require all legislators and constitutional officers to publicly disclose conflicts of interest before debating, deliberating, or voting on a piece of legislation
 * Revoke pensions for public officials convicted of violating the public trust
 * Bolster the enforcement power of the Arkansas Ethics Commission through strengthened disciplinary standards
 * Reform our campaign finance laws to prevent PAC’s from circumventing campaign contributions limits

## 5. Infrastructure

* Work with the Legislature to create a long-term highway funding strategy for the state.
 * Must be fiscally responsible and sustainable
 * Will be presented to the voters for approval
