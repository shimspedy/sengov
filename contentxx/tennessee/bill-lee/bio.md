### know more about gov Bill Lee 
I’m not a politician. I’m a cattle farmer, a businessman, a father and grandfather, and a seventh generation Tennessean. At my company, I work with electricians, pipe fitters, and plumbers. I've spent a good part of my life doing what I can to make life better for them, and now I'd like to try to make life a little better for six and a half million Tennesseans.

Traveling around the state, I've learned that most Tennesseans have a few things in common: they want a good job, a good school for their kids, and a safe neighborhood for their families. I hope to earn your support and deliver those things for your family and every other family across our state.

As a seventh-generation Tennessean, Bill’s roots run deep in this state. He was raised in Franklin where he still resides today with his wife Maria on his family’s farm. He’s the proud father of four adult children (Jessica, twin sons Jacob and Caleb, and Sarah Kate) and five grandchildren.

After attending Williamson County Schools, Bill went to Auburn University, where he studied Mechanical Engineering. When he graduated, he returned home to Franklin to join the family business his grandfather started in 1944. Through hard work, Bill learned what it takes to lead a company, doing what is necessary to help build a business and create jobs. He held several roles at Lee Company before becoming president of the company in 1992.

### Bill’s leadership
Under Bill’s leadership, the company grew into a comprehensive facilities solutions and home services company. It now employs more than 1,200 individuals and it has won numerous awards for work culture and business accomplishments.

Bill said throughout his campaign that he woke up every morning focused on how to make life better for his employees, and now he’s excited  to wake up every morning trying to improve the lives of 6.5 million Tennesseans.

As governor, Bill is focused on several priorities including good jobs, great schools, and safe neighborhoods so we can keep Tennessee moving in the right direction. Tennessee is one of the best places in the country to live and work, and he is working hard every day to try to make life even better.

Bill and Maria are people of strong faith. They are active in Grace Chapel Church and in numerous faith-based ministries, which have taken them all over the world to serve people in need, including to Africa, Central America, and the Middle East.
