          <div class="e-content" id="manifestation">
          <p>She helped lead the charge to successfully identify good, conservative judges for the federal bench across Alabama, as well as working the confirmation of Associate Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>Most recently, as president and CEO of Alabama’s business council, Katie has been working to grow Alabama jobs, strengthen the state’s business community, and stand up for small businesses, a passion first instilled by her parents, both small business owners in the Wiregrass.</p>
<p>At the business council, Katie has helped advance free market principles that support job growth and prosperity for all Alabamians. She also serves on numerous committees and task forces, including the Alabama Wildlife Federation Board of Directors. Katie volunteers her time to a multitude of civic, educational, and leadership organizations, as well.</p>
<p>Katie began her career after graduating with a degree in political science from The University of Alabama, where she was student body president. After graduation, she worked in Washington, D.C., as U.S. Senator Richard Shelby’s deputy press secretary, quickly rising to become press secretary. Katie went on to serve as special assistant to then-University of Alabama President Robert Witt. After earning her law degree from The University of Alabama School of Law, she practiced law at the Alabama-based firm Butler Snow LLP.</p>
<p>In 2015, Katie took a leave of absence from the firm to serve as Senator Shelby’s deputy campaign manager and communications director. After his successful bid for re-election, she rejoined Shelby’s team as chief of staff in 2016.</p>
<p>A proud Christian, wife and mother, faith and family are at the heart of Katie’s life. She is a lifelong conservative who is committed to fighting tirelessly to defend the right to life, securing and defending our borders, and putting Alabama first.</p>
<p>Katie resides in Montgomery with her husband, Wesley, and their two children, Bennett and Ridgeway. Wesley was a first team All-SEC and third-team AP All American as an offensive lineman at The University of Alabama, going on to play in the NFL for the New England Patriots. The family attends First United Methodist Church.</p>
<p>As the Senator for Alabama, Katie Britt will be our advocate for smaller government, modern job growth, constitutional liberties and greater opportunity.</p>
<p>Katie is an effective leader who is more interested in delivering results than talking in circles. She is running to be the senator for Alabama, not just another politician from Alabama. She will always put the interests of Alabamians first, and Katie will make Alabamians proud as their representative on the national and international stage.</p>
<p>She was born here, raised here, went to school here, built a career here, and is raising her family here. At every step along the way, Katie’s life has been marked by choosing Alabama. Now, Katie and Wesley have chosen Alabama once again by putting themselves forward, enthusiastically volunteering to fight to ensure their kids — and our kids — have the opportunity to choose an Alabama worth fighting for long into the future. We need a senator who will deliver on promises, not a career politician who keeps coming up empty.</p>
<p>Alabama is home to the military and defense communities that keep America free and strong; the aerospace industry that both connects the continents and reaches for the stars; the farmers and cattlemen that feed the world; the manufacturers that supply the goods and products we rely on; the scientists, engineers and innovators who expand our horizons every day; and so, so much more. At the end of the day, Katie wants to tell our great state’s great story — the real one. Because Alabama is first in much more than football.</p>
<h4 id="safeguarding-the-sanctity-of-life">SAFEGUARDING THE SANCTITY OF LIFE:</h4>
<p>As a Christian, wife and mother, I am 100%, unapologetically pro-life because of my faith and deeply-held family values. However, my belief in the science also reinforces my unwavering views on the issue, as there is no doubt that life begins at conception. Every life is a sacred gift from God, and I am passionately committed to protecting the unborn.</p>
<p>I am proud to stand up and fight for those that can’t themselves. From conception onwards, there is no bigger champion for Alabama’s children than me, as I believe being pro-life is much more than being pro-birth. Children need strong teachers, good schools and quality health care, and their families need opportunities for good-paying jobs.</p>
<h4 id="education">EDUCATION:</h4>
<p>I believe that all Alabamians should have the opportunity to succeed. Education is the key to opportunity, which is at the heart of the American Dream, and providing children access to high-quality educational options from an early age is critical to their ability to be successful later in life. This is why I staunchly support Alabama’s voluntary First Class Pre-K program, which has been ranked as the nation’s best for 15 consecutive years. I also believe strongly in school choice, because every single Alabama child deserves the best possible education. The jobs of tomorrow require quality education now, and I am dedicated to supporting Alabama’s children from the womb to the workforce.</p>
<h4 id="jobs-jobs-jobs">JOBS, JOBS, JOBS:</h4>
<p>I am the daughter of two small business owners who raised me to appreciate the dignity of a hard day’s work. I will work tirelessly to create an environment in which job creators can do what they do best. That means getting government out of the way of progress by slashing burdensome regulations and supporting lower taxes that enhance America’s economic competitiveness.</p>
<p>President Trump knew this was the key to success, and the result was a booming economy for Alabama and our nation.</p>
<p>Now, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have put America on the road to a vicious cycle of government dependency. Paying people more to stay home than they can earn at work. Keeping businesses and schools closed. Alabamians know that this is wrong, and I will battle back as our Senator against soaring inflation and crippling government overreach. I led the charge to keep businesses open and Main Street strong as head of the state’s business council, and now I’m ready to elevate my fight for small businesses, industry, farmers and every Alabamian who works hard to put food on the table.</p>
<p>There are three primary roadblocks dragging down our economy right now: out of control spending (including paying people to stay out of the labor force), burdensome governmental regulations and red tape, and an overcomplicated tax code that’s 10x longer than the Bible. I will be a leading voice for economic policies and regulatory reforms that foster job growth.</p>
<p>I believe in building a robust 21st century economy in which all Alabamians can thrive and provide for their families in a safe, vibrant community. From education, job and skills training, infrastructure (including broadband), and innovation, I support a pro-growth free market approach to the things that matter most for each and every Alabamians’ economic opportunity. Ultimately, this is at the heart of my Alabama First beliefs.</p>
<p>One of the biggest keys to a 21st century economy is a 21st century workforce. It’s been reported that by 2025, we will need 500,000 new highly skilled workers to meet the demands of our ever-growing industry needs. While we are currently off the pace, I will work tirelessly to help meet this ambitious goal. The students of today need to know about the opportunities available to them outside of a traditional college degree that will allow them to land high-paying, modern jobs that will support their families long into the future.</p>
<h4 id="immigration">IMMIGRATION:</h4>
<p>I am horrified and disgusted by what’s happening right now at our Southern border. A nation without borders is not a nation. The Biden Administration and congressional Democrats have abandoned the primary responsibility of government: to defend our nation from foreign threats.</p>
<p>As of April, U.S. Border Patrol reported that the number of criminal aliens encountered so far this fiscal year is up 140% over the entirety of last year – and that was still with five months to go. The same month, total Border Patrol encounters at the Southwest border were up 944% year-over-year.</p>
<p>The statistics are like this across the board and underscore that we have a security and humanitarian crisis on our hands. Border Patrol has reported not only encountering known international gang members in these numbers, but two Yemenis on the FBI’s terrorism watchlist were also apprehended trying to cross the border recently.</p>
<p>I resolutely believe we must put a stop to this siege and build the wall.</p>
<p>Not only is the Biden Administration ignoring our immigration laws, they’re also disregarding the law of nature. We lock our doors and our cars; people build fences around their houses and neighborhoods. So why shouldn’t Americans be entitled to a secure border that upholds safety and controls who is coming in?</p>
<p>Securing the border of the United States will take a combination of physical infrastructure, technology, personnel, resources, and closing legal loopholes that are routinely exploited. We must empower the Department of Homeland Security to comprehensively fix the problem.</p>
<p>The Biden Border Crisis is also unfair to those that come to America the right way – legally – in pursuit of the American Dream. I support legal immigration that promotes growth for Alabama families, jobs and communities.</p>
<h4 id="second-amendment">SECOND AMENDMENT:</h4>
<p>As a constitutional conservative, I have always unapologetically supported the Second Amendment, which our Founders wisely knew would stand as a check against the timeless tyranny of government. I believe Alabamians have a God-given right to bear arms, and I will actively fight for that right at every opportunity.</p>
<p>I support policies that best allow Alabamians to defend themselves, their loved ones, their property and their communities.</p>
<h4 id="foreign-affairs">FOREIGN AFFAIRS:</h4>
<p>Foreign affairs aren’t foreign to the millions of Alabamians impacted by them. Last year, even amid a pandemic downturn, Alabama exported over $17 billion in wide-ranging goods and services. With the ongoing upgrades at Alabama’s deep-water seaport, this will only become exponentially more important in the coming years.</p>
<p>My worldview, as it does for every facet of being your Senator, comes through an Alabama First lens. This means that every overseas decision I make will be unabashedly made with this question at the very top of mind: How does it impact Alabama? Alabamians are sick and tired of being taken advantage of and cheated by other countries and lied to by politicians here at home.</p>
<p>Globalists in D.C. have put us last for decades, and I am eager to set them straight and stand up for truly fair trade. Whether it be trade deals, armed conflicts, treaties or foreign aid, I will make sure Alabama not only has a seat at the table, but benefits directly. This includes an emphasis on domestic manufacturing and production.</p>
<p>Already, we have seen the Biden Administration bow to bad actors and adversaries across the globe. I believe America should lead from a place of strength instead of allowing business-as-usual to gradually erode our standing in the world.</p>
<p>Growing up outside the gates of Fort Rucker, I knew from an early age what the military means for Alabama – and what Alabama means for the military. Our great state plays a vital role in defending our nation from foreign threats, both domestically and abroad, and ultimately keeping all Americans free. From the program that protects our homeland from intercontinental ballistic missiles, the nuclear triad that deters such strikes, the next-generation weapons and defense systems that keep our troops safe on the battle field, the ships that are powering our 21st century Navy, the modern helicopters and planes our Armed Services need, and the world-class education and training that give our troops a needed edge, Alabama is leading across countless critical military, defense and aerospace sectors.</p>
<p>This prowess isn’t limited to here on Earth, either. Alabama is a leader in the cutting-edge research, development, manufacturing and services that power deep-space exploration, as well as national security space missions intended to combat aggression from countries like China. From the Moon to Mars, everywhere between and beyond, Alabama can play a leading part not just in foreign affairs, but across our Solar System, for years to come.</p>
<h4 id="health-care">HEALTH CARE:</h4>
<p>First, we must repeal and replace Obamacare with a plan that protects preexisting conditions and patient rights. More than a decade after the passage of Obamacare and now essentially in a third Obama term, health insurance continues to get less affordable by the day while health care costs continue to rise.</p>
<p>I support commonsense, conservative reforms that will drive costs down, increase options and access, and align with a free market-based approach. I will work to lower prescription drug costs, foster competition among providers and ultimately expand affordable health care access for all Alabamians.</p>
<p>As a daughter of the Wiregrass, I am also especially passionate about rural health care. Since Obamacare was enacted, 17 hospitals have closed in Alabama. We must close the health care gap that exists in our state, and part of that solution means closing the digital divide in Alabama by expanding telehealth options through increased access to high-speed broadband internet services. Our state currently ranks 47th in the nation in broadband connectivity, and that lack of access is negatively impacting health care, education, the economy and quality of life in communities across Alabama.</p>
<h4 id="energy">ENERGY:</h4>
<p>A strong, resilient economy is quite literally fueled by American energy independence and dominance. Unfortunately, the Biden Administration on day one made it evident they would unilaterally try to impose costly, job-killing energy policies favored by leftwing activists.</p>
<p>I support an all-of-the-above energy approach that prioritizes affordability, reliability and security. This means fully utilizing low-cost, American-made (and Alabama-made) generation such as coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydropower and biomass.</p>
<p>I am proud of Alabama’s and America’s energy producers. In our state alone, which is one of the nation’s top electricity producers, the energy industry has been estimated to generate 124,000 jobs, producing an economic impact of over $8 billion. We must restart construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and allow responsible offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico – which directly benefits our state.</p>
<p>I am ready to lead the fight against the so-called Green New Deal, which would cripple the American economy, destroy Alabama jobs, and cost the typical hardworking family $70,000 annually. I believe the Green New Deal is one of the most dangerous proposals in modern American history, and it must be defeated in the halls of Congress and at the ballot box. I will be the hands and feet of the silent majority, who believe in a commonsense approach to energy production and regulation.</p>
<p>I also proudly say this: Coal counts. I will back all of our state’s energy jobs, including our hardworking coal miners. We cannot allow Green New Deal pipe dreams to destroy jobs and communities here at home. Alabama’s coal industry has a nearly $3 billion impact, directly employing more than 3,000 people with an average salary of more than $100,000 per year.</p>
<h4 id="big-tech">BIG TECH:</h4>
<p>I will stand unequivocally for Alabamians’ freedom of religion, speech and assembly – including how those rights are commonly exercised through technology in our modern society.</p>
<p>Social media conglomerates, just like the mainstream media, have become nothing but a branch of the national Democratic Party. I view diversity of thought and opinion as pillars of America, and I’m disgusted that Big Tech has placed them on the chopping block. Censoring conservatives is not progressive, it’s un-American. Social media barons need to decide if they’re on the side of free speech or not, it’s that simple.</p>
<h4 id="supporting-our-military-and-veterans">SUPPORTING OUR MILITARY AND VETERANS:</h4>
<p>I grew up in Coffee County outside the gates of Fort Rucker, going to school with friends whose parents were deployed abroad. For me, supporting our military and extended defense community has always been personal. Our incredible men and women in uniform, whether they be active duty or reserve servicemembers, are vitally important to American safety, freedom and prosperity, as well as global stability.</p>
<p>Another integral part of our military’s success are the contractors and suppliers who support our defense and intelligence communities.</p>
<p>I will lead the charge to defend, grow and protect our existing military and defense sector footprints in Alabama, including through any future Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) rounds.</p>
<p>I also firmly believe in the principle of peace through strength. We can only keep our nation and allies safe if our military remains the strongest and most technologically superior fighting force ever known. The world is undoubtedly at its safest when America is at her strongest. However, that does not mean we should go around flexing our muscle with no end-goal or resolution in mind. President Trump knew this, and the result was no new wars under his administration, and unparalleled strides towards peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In addition to resolutely supporting our troops, I am a staunch champion of ensuring we treat our veterans like the heroes they are, even when their days of active service are long-gone. We still have a long way to go in our country when it comes to giving our veterans the world-class care and services they deserve – and our nation demands. The VA, like all governmental bureaucracies, needs leaders with business backgrounds leading the charge to cut red tape, streamline staff and services, and end the corruption. I will relentlessly work to push for reforms that see the VA operating at the speed of business – not government.</p>
<p>The VA also has a vital role to play in combatting the wave of suicides among our veterans. After making adjustments for sex and age, the rate of veteran suicides was approximately 27.5 per 100,000 individuals in 2018, up from 25.8 per 100,000 two years prior. We are failing those who have never failed us, and it’s a national disgrace I intend to take head-on.</p>
<h4 id="national-debt-crisis">NATIONAL DEBT CRISIS:</h4>
<p>I wholeheartedly believe the ballooning national debt is an existential crisis for our Republic. For years, politicians have shaken their fists about deficits and debt, only to do nothing when it came to actually implementing solutions and making tough decisions. Alabamians are wise to this all talk, no action mentality, which is why we need a proven, effective leader to tackle this generational challenge.</p>
<p>At the business council, I cut waste and rightsized the organization. I know what it takes to balance a budget in business and at home, just as all hardworking Alabama families do. One of my first actions as U.S. Senator for Alabama will be introducing a constitutional amendment to mandate the federal government balances its budget every year, just as the State of Alabama does.</p>
<p>We’ve all heard the doomsday warnings about the debt for years, but this time truly is worse than ever. Our country has never before seen this level of rampant spending &ndash; and on this magnitude of existing debt. Democrats in Congress, along with the Biden Administration, are acting like they’re dealing out Monopoly money while paying people to stay at home instead of working. However, we cannot lose sight of the terrifying reality that they are giving away money we do not have on the backs of our children and our children’s children.</p>
<p>It’s time for us to stand up for the next generation, because politicians in Washington are trying to sell our future out from underneath us.</p>
<h4 id="keep-9">KEEP 9:</h4>
<p>Working to preserve the integrity of our judicial system has been one of the highlights of my career thus far. During my time as chief of staff to U.S. Senator Richard Shelby, I had the honor of playing a leading role in identifying and confirming fellow constitutional conservatives to the federal bench in Alabama and the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. I also had the unique opportunity to work on behalf of Alabamians to help get two conservative Supreme Court Justices confirmed: Trump-nominated Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Judges and justices like these, who interpret laws instead of writing new ones from the bench, are key to maintaining the fabric of our nation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, radicals in the Democratic Party, aided and abetted by the national mainstream media, are in the middle of conducting open warfare on our federal judicial system and the norms that have guided it since the days of our Founders. This is dangerous and threatens to destabilize both the rule of law and our system of checks and balances.</p>
<p>I unabashedly stand against court packing and will fight with every fiber in my being to keep nine justices on the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<h4 id="mental-health">MENTAL HEALTH:</h4>
<p>I believe that all Alabamians should have the opportunity to succeed. There are over 200,000 of our citizens today with mental illnesses, developmental disabilities, or substance use disorders, and we must ensure every single Alabamian has access to the resources and care they need to thrive.</p>
<p>To those facing these battles, you are not alone. One in five Americans experience mental illness in their lifetime, and it’s time we eliminate the stigma associated with it. I will work every day to ensure no Alabamian is forgotten or slips through the cracks of our system.</p>
<p>This includes the people and communities of our state who have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic. In 2018, Alabama providers wrote 97.5 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people &ndash; the highest such rate in the United States and almost twofold greater than the national average. While elected officials on the state level have taken strides in recent years to move the needle in the right direction, we still have a long way to go. As we continue to combat this crisis, part of the effort must include holding bad actors responsible for their roles in creating this deadly problem. Nearly half of the 775 reported drug overdose deaths in Alabama involved opioids in 2018.</p>
<p>I will also support efforts to stem the rash of suicides facing Alabama and our nation as a whole. As of 2018, the suicide rate in Alabama was 16.8 per 100,000, which was higher than the national average of 14.2 per 100,000. This made suicide the 11th leading cause of death in our state, with 823 citizens lost to suicide compared to 567 deaths due to homicide.</p>
<p>While supporting mental health efforts goes hand-in-hand with lowering the suicide rate, suicide is a complicated issue and is rarely caused by a single factor. CDC data has indicated that more than 50% of people who die by suicide are not known to have a mental illness. Factors such as substance abuse, physical health, job trouble, money or legal difficulties can also contribute to overwhelming stress and/or a lack of hope. My goal is to help build an Alabama in which increased opportunity and the proper safety net of resources combine to decrease these common suicide factors.</p>
<p>Resources are available for those battling mental illness via the National Alliance for Mental Illness here and the Alabama Department of Mental Health here.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, please call the Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255.</p>
<h4 id="agriculture">AGRICULTURE:</h4>
<p>Agriculture is Alabama’s largest industry and acts as the economic engine for communities in every corner of our state. I will be an unwavering champion of farmers, cattlemen and everyone in the forestry sector as the Senator for Alabama.</p>
<p>I will fight senseless regulations and red tape and stand up for family farmers. This includes working to repeal the Death Tax, which is a grave threat to Alabama’s family farms. Our farmers have been tending to Alabama’s land for generations, and they don’t need federal bureaucrats telling them how to earn their livelihood.</p>
<p>Farmers also rely on exports for their livelihood, and I will work tirelessly to ensure all of Alabama’s industries are getting a truly fair shake in foreign trade.</p>
<p>Modern agriculture requires advanced technology and equipment, some of which requires high-speed broadband internet service. Unfortunately, Alabama ranks nearly last in the nation when it comes to broadband connectivity. I will be a staunch supporter of efforts to expand affordable broadband service to all Alabamians, so zip codes don’t define opportunity for our citizens.</p>
<h4 id="israel">ISRAEL:</h4>
<p>I am proud to avidly support Israel, and I will never back down or waver from that stance. Israel is a key strategic ally of the United States and an oasis of democracy in the Middle East., shining the light of freedom on a region that so desperately needs it.</p>
<p>Our state also has a long friendship with Israel, as Alabama was the first state in the U.S. to recognize Israel as a nation. That relationship has only strengthened in recent years, with Alabama and Israel continuing to grow a budding, mutually beneficial trade relationship.</p>
<p>President Trump was right to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and I will fight to keep it there permanently. Jerusalem is the historical capital of Israel, which has an undivided right to the city.</p>
<p>I will unflinchingly stand up for Israel’s ability and right to defend itself from Hamas and other terror groups in the region. Israel is our friend and partner, and I believe an attack on them is an attack on America.</p>
<h4 id="election-integrity">ELECTION INTEGRITY:</h4>
<p>The right to vote in a free and fair election is the most basic American civil right and a cornerstone on which many other core rights stand upon. The integrity of America’s elections has also historically set us apart from countries across the world, making us a global beacon for democracy and freedom.</p>
<p>Every American must be able to trust the voting process and the resulting outcome; otherwise, our cherished country will crumble around us.</p>
<p>I will work tirelessly to uphold election integrity and fight voter fraud. Alabama’s secure, free and fair elections should be a model for the country, and I intend to teach Washington a thing or two when elected. This means defeating the disastrous HR 1, which would federalize elections, ban photo voter ID across the nation and mandate taxpayer money funding political campaigns against Alabamians&rsquo; will.</p>
<h4 id="building-safe-communities">BUILDING SAFE COMMUNITIES:</h4>
<p>I am proud to support our brave law enforcement officers who leave their own homes to protect and serve us every single day. They are the backbones of our communities, who go above and beyond, shying away from the limelight, to keep our families and neighborhoods safe.</p>
<p>Radical calls to “Defund the Police” have no basis in reality, as they would do the most harm to the very underserved communities already experiencing the highest levels of violent crime. I believe in ensuring our law enforcement officers are the best trained and best equipped in the world; we must also recruit and retain the best people to protect and serve, which means ensuring these heroic individuals are paid and treated like the professionals that they are.</p>
<p>I also know that poverty and hopelessness are the main roots of crime in communities. I fully support fixing our broken mental health system, so people can get the medical help they need before personal crises turn into crimes. Additionally, I believe in the power of education and opportunity in keeping kids off the street and steering them to land high-quality jobs. Another important part of this equation is the family structure and values with which children are raised. I am a major proponent of mentoring, because all kids deserve and need strong role models in their lives to thrive into the future. I support Alabama&rsquo;s families, school prayer, and after-school programs – including youth sports.</p>
