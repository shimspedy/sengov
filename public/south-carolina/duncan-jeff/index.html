He believes energy dominance is vital to our national security and critical to job creation. He has supported many research opportunities and missions in the Third District and in other areas of the state that bring our country closer to true energy dominance.  Jeff takes a particular interest in the promotion of nuclear energy as he believes it is an important component of our energy matrix, providing carbon free energy, and South Carolina is home to the Savannah River Site nuclear complex. Duncan also actively supports the use of the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository site in Nevada as a long-term storage site for nuclear waste. Further, Duncan advocates for offshore energy exploration which has the potential to create thousands of jobs and generate millions in revenue for South Carolina.

<h4 id="immigration">IMMIGRATION</h4>
<p>You will not find anyone in Congress who supports securing our borders, and enforcing our immigration laws more than Jeff Duncan. Jeff has stood with President Trump has he has fought against illegal immigration, and to stop the flow of drugs and crime coming into our country. Jeff has a top rating with the pro-immigration enforcement group Numbers USA, and has been a long advocate for banning sanctuary cities, requiring mandatory E-Verify, eliminating birthright citizenship, and ending chain migration.</p>
<h4 id="jobs">JOBS</h4>
<p>As a small businessman, Duncan saw first-hand the negative impact that a bloated government bureaucracy, high taxes, and fiscal responsibility had on small businesses and the economy. Knowing the impact of tax increases on the average household and business, Duncan proudly supports lower taxes and supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which not only created jobs, but increased wages for American workers. Not only does Duncan support job creation, he fights daily to remove burdensome regulations that send American jobs overseas. When we get government out of the way, businesses can thrive. Not only will business thrive, but individuals will be able to keep more of what they work hard to earn.</p>
<h4 id="energy">ENERGY</h4>
<p>As a staunch proponent of American energy independence, Duncan makes decisions on the House Energy and Commerce Committee through a free market lens. In addition to supporting nuclear energy and the many jobs it creates, Duncan supports increased access to natural resources and ending American dependence on foreign sources of energy.</p>
<h4 id="founding-fathers">FOUNDING FATHERS</h4>
<p>As a lifetime hunter, sport shooter, and defender of liberty, Congressman Duncan fully supports the Right to Bear Arms, and opposes all efforts to take away these important and fundamental rights. Jeff staunchly opposes Beto O’Rourke’s radical gun confiscation program, and supports legislation like the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act and the Hearing Protection Act that would make it easier for Americans to exercise their constitutionally protected right to carry.</p>
<h4 id="taxes">TAXES</h4>
<p>As a small businessman, Duncan saw first-hand the negative impact that a bloated government bureaucracy, high taxes, and fiscal responsibility had on small businesses and the economy. Knowing the impact of tax increases on the average household and business, Duncan proudly supports lower taxes and supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which not only created jobs, but increased wages for American workers. Not only does Duncan support job creation, he fights daily to remove burdensome regulations that send American jobs overseas. When we get government out of the way, businesses can thrive. Not only will business thrive, but individuals will be able to keep more of what they work hard to earn.</p>
<h4 id="protecting-life">PROTECTING LIFE</h4>
<p>Congressman Duncan is strongly pro-life and has a perfect pro-life rating from National Right to Life. Jeff believes life begins at conception, and that unborn persons are entitled to the same inalienable, God-given rights as all Americans. Jeff has fought to prevent abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from receiving any taxpayer funds, and has championed many pro-life causes in Congress. Being pro-life, Congressman Duncan supports strengthening adoption and foster care programs in the United States, which includes protecting organizations and ministries like Miracle Hill from federal Interference.</p>
<h4 id="debt--spending">DEBT &amp; SPENDING</h4>
<p>Congressman Duncan is proud to have one of the highest rankings in all of Congress on fiscal responsibility. Our nation is not in debt because we tax Americans too little, our nation is in debt because our government spends too much money. Duncan has consistently voted for spending cuts in Washington, and has authored and co-sponsored numerous pieces of legislation to drastically cut federal spending. Jeff is a strong advocate for a balanced budget amendment, and has pushed for the adoption of federal spending caps.</p>
<h4 id="national-defense">NATIONAL DEFENSE</h4>
<p>The defense and security of our nation is one of the few areas that our Founding Fathers recognized needed to be a federal issue. Congressman Duncan believes a strong national defense starts with taking care of those who are willing to put on a uniform in defense of freedom, both during and after their term of service. That also means putting political correctness aside, and taking steps to eliminate the threat of radical Islamic terrorism both at home and abroad.</p>
