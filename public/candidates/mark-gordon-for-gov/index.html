        <div class="e-content entry-content" id="manifestation"><h2 id="mark-gordon-for-governor">Mark Gordon for governor</h2>
<p>Mark Gordon was elected Wyoming’s 33rd Governor, on Nov. 6, 2018. He was sworn into office on January 7, 2019.</p>
<p>Mark Gordon grew up on the family ranch in Wyoming where he learned the values of hard work and integrity and the importance of working together. As Governor, he brings those values to the table, maintaining his commitment to a Wyoming where its citizens can pursue their dreams while the state retains its unique character. He is a strong believer that Wyoming must chart its own course, and a steadfast defender of its interests to do so.</p>
<p>As a conservative, Governor Gordon has worked tirelessly to set Wyoming on a sustainable fiscal path. He is committed to making government more transparent, accessible, productive and efficient. He believes government is best when it is closest to the people, and is committed to giving local communities the tools they need to thrive. He is a staunch advocate of quality education for all children from bottom to top, K-12 through all forms of post-secondary education, private and public.</p>
<p>Governor Gordon served as Wyoming State Treasurer from October 2012 until January 2019 when he was sworn in as Governor. He was ranked 57th among the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute’s “most significant and impactful public investor executives” in 2013. During his time in office, he transformed and modernized the management of the state’s financial portfolio, leading in 2016 to Wyoming earning the No. 1 ranking in the United States and No. 3 in the world among all sovereign funds by the Peterson Institute.</p>
<p>Elected Governor in 2018, he has successfully led Wyoming through two of its most significant challenges in decades: the COVID-19 crisis and the most significant decline in mineral revenue in the state’s history. He has spearheaded efforts to diversify all sectors of Wyoming’s economy, including technology, finance, agriculture, energy, including carbon capture and sequestration, research, education and tourism. He is dedicated to continuing to make the state a darn good place to raise kids.</p>
<p>Governor Gordon and his wife Jennie have four grown children – Anne; Aaron with wife Megan; Bea with husband Austen and their son Crawford; and Spencer with wife Sarah, their son Everett, and twin daughters Violet and Eloise.</p>
<h2 id="meet-jennie">MEET JENNIE</h2>
<p>Jennie Gordon currently serves as First Lady of Wyoming.</p>
<p>Prior to that, she managed day-to-day operations at Merlin Ranch, the Gordon family’s cow-calf and heifer development operation located in Johnson County.</p>
<p>Jennie grew up in Omaha, Nebraska until her family moved to Buffalo, Wyoming. Jennie’s father, Senior Master Sergeant Robert Muir, served in the Navy, Army and the Air Force. Jennie’s mother, Gertrude Muir, was from Austria and after surviving World War II in Vienna, she moved to the United States. She learned English and raised the family’s ten children, often with Sergeant Muir serving away from home. Four of Jennie’s siblings have served, or continue to serve, in the armed services.</p>
<p>The First Lady received her Bachelor’s Degree in Health Sciences from the University of Wyoming. She worked for 15 years as a laboratory medical technologist at Sheridan Memorial Hospital. She later served as a field service representative for Abbott Laboratories where she traveled throughout the western United States repairing and servicing laboratory equipment at hospitals, clinics and private practices.</p>
<p>When Governor Matthew H. Mead appointed her husband to serve as Wyoming Treasurer in 2012, Jennie took over management of the Merlin Ranch full time. The ranch has garnered national recognition for its environmental stewardship and conservation achievements, as well as efforts to promote the sale of Wyoming beef worldwide. Jennie previously served on the board of the Wyoming Stock Growers Land Trust and is a graduate of the Wyoming Leadership Education and Development (L.E.A.D.) class.</p>
<p>Governor Gordon and Jennie have four grown children – Anne; Aaron with wife Megan; Bea with husband Austen and their son Crawford; and Spencer with wife Sarah, their son Everett, and twin daughters Violet and Eloise.</p>
<p>In October 2019 Jennie launched the Wyoming Hunger Initiative, whose mission is to end childhood hunger in Wyoming. The initiative works to prevent food insecurity by increasing awareness and support for the work of local anti-hunger organizations statewide.</p>
<h2 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h2>
<p>Because of COVID-19, Wyoming suffered through one of the toughest budget crunches in our history. Mark Gordon reduced state spending by 26% and now the state budget is the lowest in a decade. Governor Gordon created the Energy Rebound Program to protect energy jobs. He will continue to attract new industries and fight against federal and state regulations that threaten our way of life.</p>
<p>Mark pushed back against Washington’s efforts to shut down schools, and as a result, Wyoming schools were reported as having educated more in-person days during the pandemic than any other school system in the country. He also launched the Reimagining and Innovating the Delivery of Education (RIDE) program to work with parents, businesses and communities to better educate Wyoming’s future leaders.</p>
<p>When Washington asserted authority over the Wyoming National Guard with vaccine mandates, Mark said no, and Wyoming has retained its sovereignty over our troops. Mark traveled to our lawless southern border with Texas Governor Abbott and has seen the human tragedy firsthand.  He is committed to securing our borders and ending the drug and human trafficking resulting from President Biden’s open border policy.</p>
<p>As the New Green Deal movement shut down large portions of our economy, Mark fought back with nearly 40 lawsuits including one lifting the Biden ban on oil and gas leasing. Mark also brokered an agreement to keep Wyoming’s Jim Bridger Power Plant operating by addressing environmental concerns while protecting Wyoming jobs and using Wyoming energy.</p>

<p>I BELIEVE government must practice fiscal responsibility and allow individuals to keep more of the money they earn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I BELIEVE the proper role of government is to provide for the people only those critical functions that cannot be performed by individuals or private organizations and that the best government is that which governs least.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I BELIEVE the most effective, responsible, and responsive government is government closest to the people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I BELIEVE Americans must retain the principles that have made us strong while developing new and innovative ideas to meet the challenges of changing times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I BELIEVE Americans value and should preserve our national strength and pride while working to extend peace, freedom and human rights throughout the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FINALLY, I am a Republican because I believe the Republican Party is the best vehicle for translating these ideals into positive and successful principles of government.</p>
