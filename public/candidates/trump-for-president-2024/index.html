        <div class="e-content entry-content" id="manifestation"><p>Donald John Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has been a controversial figure both during and after his time in office. As he continues to be a prominent voice in American politics, it&rsquo;s worth revisiting the policies he put forth during his presidential campaign.</p>
<h4 id="our-mission-to-make-america-great-again">Our Mission to Make America Great Again</h4>
<p>I left behind my former life because I could not sit by and watch career politicians continue bleeding this country dry and allow other nations to take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense. As President, I took on every powerful special interest, fixing globalist trade deals, ending foreign wars, securing the border, and standing up to Big Pharma and China. Together, we put America First and returned power to the American People.</p>
<p>The corrupt government cartel is once again destroying our country. We are a nation that surrendered in Afghanistan, and allowed Russia to devastate Ukraine, China to threaten Taiwan, and Iran to build a nuclear weapon. We are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed, crime is rampant like never before, terrorists are invading our southern border, and the economy is in a recession. We are a nation that is hostile to liberty, freedom, and faith.</p>
<p>Our populist movement to Make America Great Again is the only force on earth that will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. I will never stop fighting for you, the American People, against the failed political establishment. I take the slings and arrows for you so that we can have our country back. Together, we will finish the job of saving our country once and for all and raise the next generation of strong American Patriots and Leaders.</p>
<h4 id="rebuild-the-greatest-economy-in-history">Rebuild the Greatest Economy in History</h4>
<p>President Donald J. Trump passed record-setting tax relief for the middle class, doubled the child tax credit, and slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. Real wages quickly increased as a result, and median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country, while poverty reached a record low. President Trump created nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones to revitalize neglected communities. President Trump produced a booming economic recovery, and record low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and women. Joe Biden is the destroyer of America’s jobs and continues to fuel runaway inflation with reckless big government spending. President Trump’s vision for America’s economic revival is lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more jobs for American workers.</p>
<h4 id="fair-trade-for-the-american-worker">Fair Trade for the American Worker</h4>
<p>Donald Trump recognized long before he became president that we cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others. President Trump replaced decades of calamitous multinational trade blunders with fair and reciprocal trade that returned jobs, wealth, and manufacturing to America. He cancelled the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, replaced the NAFTA nightmare with the groundbreaking USMCA, and renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal. President Trump confronted unfair trade practices, imposed tariffs on China that brought billions of dollars into the federal treasury, expanded American agriculture, and opened thousands of new factories. President Trump will implement a 4-year national reshoring plan so that the United States no longer needs to rely on China for essential medical and national security goods, and ban Chinese ownership of all critical infrastructure in the United States. We will bring back our supply chains, and build America into the manufacturing superpower of the world.</p>
<h4 id="unleash-energy-dominance">Unleash Energy Dominance</h4>
<p>Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, the United States became the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth, achieving American energy independence and delivering historically low costs for oil, gas, diesel, and electricity to consumers and businesses. President Trump unlocked our country’s God-given abundance of oil, natural gas, and clean coal. He approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access, pipelines, opening federal lands and offshore areas for responsible oil and gas production, and ending the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord. Joe Biden reversed the Trump Energy Revolution and is now enriching foreign adversaries abroad. President Trump will unleash the production of domestic energy resources, reduce the soaring price of gasoline, diesel and natural gas, promote energy security for our friends around the world, eliminate the socialist Green New Deal and ensure the United States is never again at the mercy of a foreign supplier of energy.</p>
<h4 id="secure-borders-and-reclaim-national-sovereignty">Secure Borders and Reclaim National Sovereignty</h4>
<p>President Donald J. Trump created the most secure border in U.S. history. He ended catch-and-release, took down human traffickers, deported record numbers of illegal alien gang members, and built 450 miles of powerful new wall. Joe Biden turned our country into one giant sanctuary for dangerous criminal aliens when he suspended all immigration enforcement in the middle of a global pandemic and reversed landmark agreements that safely returned asylum-seekers to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The onslaught of illegal aliens invading our wide-open borders threatens public safety, drains the treasury, undermines U.S. workers, and burdens schools and hospitals. President Trump will shut down Biden’s border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals. He will also deliver a merit-based immigration system that protects American labor and promotes American values.</p>
<h4 id="war-on-the-drug-cartels">War on the Drug Cartels</h4>
<p>President Donald J. Trump marshalled the full power of government to stop deadly drugs, opioids, and fentanyl from coming into our country. As a result, drug overdose deaths declined nationwide for the first time in nearly 30 years. Joe Biden has allowed drug cartels to wage war on America, steal innocent lives, and ravage our communities. President Trump will take down the drug cartels just as he took down ISIS. He will impose a total naval embargo on cartels, order the Department of Defense to inflict maximum damage on cartel leadership and operations, designate cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, and choke off their access to the global financial system. President Trump will get the full cooperation of neighboring governments to dismantle the cartels, or else expose every bribe and kickback that allows these criminal networks to preserve their brutal reign. He will ask Congress to ensure that drug smugglers and traffickers can receive the Death Penalty. When President Trump is back in the White House, the drug kingpins and vicious traffickers will never sleep soundly again.</p>
<h4 id="stop-crime-and-restore-safety">Stop Crime and Restore Safety</h4>
<p>There is no higher priority than quickly restoring law and order and public safety in America. President Trump stands with the heroes of law enforcement. Joe Biden and the radical left politicians have defunded, defamed, and dismantled police forces across America. Murders spiked to all-time highs in Democrat-run cities and radical prosecutors and District Attorneys have given free rein to violent criminals who threaten our citizens. The streets of our once-great cities are now controlled by gangs and cartels, and plagued with mentally ill and drug-addicted homeless. President Trump will revitalize police departments and reclaim safety, dignity, and peace for law-abiding Americans. He will deliver record funding to hire and retrain police officers, strengthen qualified immunity and other protections for police officers, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, put violent offenders and career criminals behind bars, and surge federal prosecutors and the National Guard into high-crime communities.</p>
<h4 id="renew-american-strength-and-leadership">Renew American Strength and Leadership</h4>
<p>President Donald J. Trump replaced the failed policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building with a bold vision to pursue peace through strength. He fully rebuilt American military might, modernized our nuclear arsenal, and launched the Space Force. He obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate, killed its founder and leader Abu-Bakar Al Baghdadi, and eliminated the world&rsquo;s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. President Trump kept America out of new wars and brought thousands of brave troops home from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and many other countries. Joe Biden has undermined our military readiness and surrendered our strength to the Taliban. President Trump will defend America against all threats, protect America against all dangers, and keep America out of unnecessary foreign wars. He will also get Biden’s radical left ideology out of our military and rehire every patriot who was unjustly fired. To protect our people from the threat of nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles, President Trump will also build a state-of-the-art next-generation missile defense shield.</p>
<h4 id="reject-globalism-and-embrace-patriotism">Reject Globalism and Embrace Patriotism</h4>
<p>President Donald J. Trump forged international cooperation among strong, sovereign, and independent nations to create a future of peace, prosperity, and promise for the world. He combatted Radical Islamic terrorism, withdrew from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, and suspended travel and refugee resettlement from the world’s most dangerous regions. He recognized Israel&rsquo;s true capital and moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem and acknowledged Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a result of his bold diplomacy and principled realism, President Trump brokered four Middle East peace deals, collectively called the Abraham Accords, and our NATO allies agreed to pay $400 billion more in defense spending. Joe Biden’s humiliating defeat in Afghanistan has emboldened rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran that were in retreat. Under President Trump, we will restore our standing in the world and American leadership abroad.</p>
<h4 id="care-for-our-veterans">Care For Our Veterans</h4>
<p>While Washington politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into misguided military adventures overseas, those who proudly wore our nation’s uniform were dying waiting for medical care at home. President Donald J. Trump passed the largest reform of the Department of Veterans Affairs in a generation, including VA Accountability and VA Choice, and fired 11,500 federal workers who failed to give our wounded warriors the quality and timely care they so richly deserve. He secured record funding for mental health services, and expanded access to telehealth and suicide prevention resources. To secure the blessings of freedom for those who risked their lives to defend it, President Trump decreased veteran homelessness, increased educational benefits, and achieved record-low veteran unemployment.  We will fight to serve our veterans with better care and benefits than ever before.</p>
<h4 id="protect-parents-rights">Protect Parents’ Rights</h4>
<p>President Donald J. Trump fought tirelessly to expand charter schools and school choice for America’s children. He secured permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and protected free speech on college campuses. Now, Joe Biden and the radical left are using the public school system to push their perverse sexual, racial, and political material on our youth. President Trump will cut federal funding for any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory or gender ideology on our children. His administration will open Civil Rights investigations into any school district that has engaged in race-based discrimination. President Trump will veto the sinister effort to weaponize civics education, keep men out of women’s sports, and create a credentialing body to certify teachers who embrace patriotic values. President Trump will reward states and school districts that abolish teacher tenure for grades K-12 and adopt Merit Pay, cut the number of school administrators, adopt a Parental Bill of Rights, and implement the direct election of school principals by the parents.</p>
<h4 id="defend-law-and-liberty">Defend Law and Liberty</h4>
<p>President Donald J. Trump appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret the Constitution as written and preserve the extraordinary vision of our founding fathers. He confirmed three strong Constitutionalists to the United States Supreme Court who will ensure the law is upheld equally, fairly and without political prejudice for all of our citizens. President Trump’s three appointees delivered the biggest win for life in a generation in overturning Roe v. Wade and expanded the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. President Trump will continue to nominate highly qualified prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. He will also always defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, and uphold your religious liberty, including the Constitutional right to pray in public schools.</p>
<h4 id="end-censorship-and-reclaim-free-speech">End Censorship and Reclaim Free Speech</h4>
<p>President Trump is absolutely committed to dismantling and destroying the left-wing censorship regime. If we don’t have free speech in America, then we will no longer be a free country. President Trump’s plan includes firing any federal bureaucrat who has engaged in censoring the lawful speech of American citizens, banning taxpayer funds from being used to categorize lawful speech for purposes of illicit censorship, banning federal agencies from censoring speech, stopping federal funding for all non-profits and academic programs engaged in censorship, passing a digital bill of rights, and enacting landmark legislation to drastically limit the ability of big social media platforms to restrict free speech. By restoring free speech, we will begin to reclaim our democracy.</p>
<h4 id="free-honest-and-lawful-elections">Free, Honest and Lawful Elections</h4>
<p>President Donald J. Trump is committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our Republic. We will reform our election laws to verify the identity and eligibility of all voters to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections. We will pass a bold range of critical election integrity measures that include banning unsecure drop boxes and ballot harvesting. State and local officials cannot be permitted to make illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the required approvals by the state legislatures. Very importantly, we must ban private money from pouring into local election offices.</p>
<h4 id="drain-the-swamp-of-washington-corruption">Drain the Swamp of Washington Corruption</h4>
<p>President Donald J. Trump is committed to dismantling the deep state and restoring government by the People, just as he did during his administration. President Trump will conduct a top-to-bottom overhaul of the federal bureaucracies to clean out the rot and corruption of Washington D.C. President Trump will push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress, a permanent ban on taxpayer funding of campaigns, a lifetime ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and cabinet members, and a ban on members of Congress trading stocks with insider information.</p>
<h4 id="better-health-care-choices-at-lower-costs">Better Health Care Choices at Lower Costs</h4>
<p>President Donald J. Trump empowered American patients by greatly expanding healthcare choice, transparency, and affordability. He increased competition in the health insurance market, eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate, and signed Right to Try that gives terminally ill patients access to lifesaving cures. President Trump lowered drug prices for the first time in over 50 years and finalized the Most Favored Nation Rule to ensure that pharmaceutical companies offer the same discounts to the United States as they do to other nations. To save lives from the China virus, President Trump organized the production of the world’s largest supply of ventilators and the development of treatments and vaccines. He will stop all COVID mandates and restore medical freedom, end surprise medical billing, increase fairness through price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. President Trump will always protect Medicare, Social Security, and patients with pre-existing conditions.</p>
