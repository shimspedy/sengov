        <div class="e-content entry-content" id="manifestation"><h2 id="deidre-dejear-for-governor">Deidre DeJear for governor</h2>
<p>Iowans want someone to get to work for them. Deidre has dedicated her life to serving her community and that is what she will do as Governor starting on Day One.</p>
<p>Deidre was born in Jackson, Mississippi, and as a child moved with her family to Oklahoma. At eight years old, Deidre’s mother passed away shortly after giving birth to her younger sister. Overcoming this adversity at such a young age and seeing her dad be present for her and her siblings shaped who Deidre is today. Having her life turned upside down taught her to value life, value people and relationships, and how to overcome any hurdle thrown her way.</p>
<p>Deidre moved to Iowa to attend Drake University, where she majored in Broadcast News and Politics and graduated with a B.A. in Journalism. She fell in love with the state and chose Iowa as her home. An early social impact entrepreneur, while still a student, Deidre co-founded the nonprofit Back to School Iowa to support youth to continue in their educational endeavors. They have since given away school supplies to thousands of Des Moines students. During her time serving as a competitive coach for the East High girls basketball team, Deidre traveled the state and helped to shape the lives of the girls on her team. While traveling the state, Iowans welcomed Deidre everywhere she went.</p>
<p>I’m here because of my family. I’m here because of Iowa’s values. I’m here because Iowa has potential.</p>
<p>Deidre built her business nearly 15 years ago to support the growing need for small businesses to access affordable marketing tools and successful business strategies during the brink of the Great Recession. Deidre has helped over 1000 small businesses across Iowa. Her work continues to empower small business owners, and her passion for their success drives her to find new and innovative ways to help them grow. Her early work laid the foundation to help over 120 business owners during the pandemic gain access to much needed funding and resources.</p>
<p>While I was not born in Iowa, I started my business here, met my husband here, and found my home here. I was introduced to a community who took care of people, who wrapped their arms around me, and created  pathways of opportunity that I have been paying forward ever since. There is no other place I could have done all of this.</p>
<p>Iowans have been through a lot these past few years, but the potential and desire to make their future even better still exists. Deidre believes in Iowans, and knows that by working together, change can happen.</p>
<p>Our children are worth fighting for the best education system possible; we can put Iowa schools back on top by working with parents, teachers, and our local governments to solve our challenges and invest in our future. Small businesses, the backbone of our economy and small towns, are worth the investment and support; as I have done throughout my career, I will be a champion for their needs to get them resources to recover from the pandemic and continue to grow our economy. Too many of our rural hospitals are at risk. I will prioritize increasing access to affordable, quality healthcare and mental healthcare for all Iowans. Working families have been hit hard over the past few years. I will support them by closing our skills gap, wage gap, and keeping jobs here in Iowa.</p>
<p>Deidre knows firsthand that what Iowans want is for our government to focus on our common needs, not the small differences that divide us. But government only works well if it’s led well. That is not what we are seeing in Iowa today, where our Governor foments partisanship and pits Democrats and Republicans against one another for political gain.</p>
<h2 id="about-lt-governor-eric-van-lancker">About Lt. Governor Eric Van Lancker</h2>
<p>Eric Van Lancker has served as Clinton County Auditor and Commissioner of Elections for 12 years and is currently in his fourth term. Eric served as President of the Iowa State Association of County Auditors (ISACA) in 2014 and has served several years as the President of ISACA District 6. Eric has also served several years as the State Election Administration Training (SEAT) Curriculum Chairman as well as taught several SEAT sessions.</p>
<p>Eric was born and raised in Cedar Rapids. He graduated from the University of Northern Iowa with a degree in Communications — Radio/TV Broadcasting. Eric worked as a journalist for more than a decade. He also did development and marketing for a non-profit agency that provided services to people with disabilities in Clinton County. Eric also worked for the City of Clinton as Assistant Superintendent of Collections Systems (sewer maintenance and solid waste collection) before being elected as Clinton County Auditor in 2008.</p>
<p>Eric and Tanya have been married for 28 years and have lived in Clinton since marriage. They have two grown children, Caitlyn and Jackson.</p>
<h2 id="issues">ISSUES</h2>
<p>Iowa is my home, and as your Governor,  I will work hard for you because I know that Iowa is worth the work. I am committed to ensuring that our state and its people are supported and our communities are strengthened. There is something special about this state. and as I am traveling county by county, I’m not the only one who believes that. I’ve met Iowans who take great pride in this state, however imperfect it may be, they see the good in their communities and the potential for our future.</p>
<p>Iowa has built small businesses, Iowa has built national education models, we built the first computer, Iowa has built a thriving agricultural system, Iowa has built good hard working people, Iowa has built fields of opportunity. We aren’t done building. We’ve got work to do, because Iowa is worth the work.</p>
<h2 id="economic-development">ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>In Iowa we have a skills gap, a worker shortage and continue to see a loss of jobs in our rural and urban communities. We must implement a true, comprehensive economic plan that will keep jobs here, attract new manufacturing and technology jobs, strengthen small businesses, welcome unions and their support of workers rights, ensure a sustainable wage for all Iowa families, and close the skills gap through training and education to Iowa’s untapped talent.</p>
<h2 id="voting">VOTING</h2>
<p>Voting is our most basic, democratic right and must be protected. It is time to strengthen our voting system, making it safe and accessible so ALL Iowans have equal access to the ballot box and can rightfully participate in our democracy. Iowa has always positioned itself as a leader, now is the time to lead by example and ensure the protection of all Iowans’ voting rights.</p>
<h2 id="education">EDUCATION</h2>
<p>Every Iowan deserves a first class education that prepares them for a career and/or higher education. It is time to fully fund our education system at every level, including universal Pre-K and child care, affordable colleges and trade programs, and prioritizing equitable pay and benefits for Iowa educators.</p>
<h2 id="technology">TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>Iowa is 45th in the nation in broadband speed. Our state must live up to its potential and finally become a competitive technological hub by expanding broadband, increasing speeds, and welcoming the technologically driven jobs of the future.</p>
<h2 id="accessible-affordable-healthcare">ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE</h2>
<p>Access to quality affordable healthcare and mental health services is imperative. Unfortunately it is out of reach for too many, including our rural communities. The COVID-19 Pandemic has unveiled the inadequacies in Iowa’s healthcare systems; now more than ever we must make sure our healthcare system meets the needs of Iowans today and improves the future of health and wellness for every Iowan and healthcare practitioner.</p>
<h2 id="clean-water--environmental-justice">CLEAN WATER / ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</h2>
<p>Iowa has always been a place of fruitful soil and fields of opportunity. With the very pressing threat of climate change affecting our world, Iowa must move forward as a leader with an environmental justice plan that centers on protecting our rural communities, communities of color, communities with disabilities, our children and the sick. Protecting our waterways while creating good paying renewable energy jobs will enhance our lives and further strengthen our economy.</p>
<h2 id="rural-development">RURAL DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>Our rural communities are integral to the success of our state. We must invest in our rural areas so that people can live in the communities they love; from sustainable farms to thriving town squares with small business development, jobs, technological upgrades, quality education and accessible health care. Neglecting the needs of rural Iowans only moves this state farther back rather than forward.</p>
