<br><br>
        <div class="e-content entry-content" id="manifestation"><p>Marianne Williamson is a renowned bestselling author, dedicated political activist, and influential spiritual thought leader.</p>
<p>For more than three decades, she has played a pivotal role in progressive spiritual and religious circles. She boasts an impressive literary portfolio, with 15 published books, four of which have achieved the esteemed status of #1 New York Times bestsellers.</p>
<p>In 1989, Williamson established Project Angel Food, a non-profit organization with a remarkable track record of delivering over 16 million meals to homebound patients battling serious illnesses. This initiative was born out of a genuine desire to aid those suffering from the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, Marianne Williamson has tirelessly championed causes related to poverty alleviation, combating hunger, and fostering racial reconciliation. Her advocacy efforts extend to co-founding The Peace Alliance in 2004, an organization committed to advancing the concept of a U.S. Department of Peace.</p>
<p>In the realm of politics, Marianne Williamson pursued the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 2020, reflecting her unwavering commitment to effecting positive change.</p>
<p>Marianne Williamson possesses a profound understanding of the systemic shortcomings plaguing our nation today. With a career spanning four decades dedicated to personal and systemic transformation, she has inspired countless individuals to triumph in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>Marianne&rsquo;s vision is rooted in a profound desire for an America that embraces both its triumphs and its mistakes—a nation poised for a new chapter, America 2.0. In these unprecedented times, she firmly believes that the status quo in politics has proven inadequate. The call of the hour is for transformative leadership, and Marianne asserts that a woman is the best choice to lead us through these challenging times.</p>
<p><strong>Why I&rsquo;m Seeking Office</strong></p>
<p>Four decades ago, I embarked on a journey, delivering lectures in Los Angeles on a profound set of teachings known as &ldquo;A Course in Miracles.&rdquo; This course, not a religion but a program of spiritual self-exploration grounded in universal truths, captivated me. I was overjoyed to share insights from it with fellow seekers.</p>
<p>However, a somber turn of events occurred shortly after. The AIDS crisis erupted into a catastrophic epidemic, especially impacting cities like Los Angeles. The medical community raced against time to find solutions, but the outlook was grim. Many who contracted HIV faced the grim prospect of death. Young, vibrant, talented individuals were abruptly cut down in vast numbers, and an atmosphere of despair permeated society. Moreover, pervasive homophobia compounded the suffering, forcing some young men into silence about their true selves even as they faced mortality.</p>
<p><strong>How My Path Unfolded</strong></p>
<p>During this tumultuous period, individuals from the LGBTQ+ community in Los Angeles and later in New York started attending my lectures. They encountered a vision of a loving and accepting God, discovering the transformative power of forgiveness. My lectures became sanctuaries where a grieving and traumatized population could seek comfort, community, and solace through prayer.</p>
<p>As my lectures expanded, we introduced support groups for the ailing during the week. I initiated non-profit organizations in Los Angeles and New York that offered vital non-medical assistance to those confronting life-threatening illnesses. Our mission was simple: while we couldn&rsquo;t control their illnesses, we could ensure they were never alone and always felt loved. Project Angel Food, born from this ethos, has now delivered over 14 million meals to homebound patients battling critical illnesses in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>During this period, I also delved into writing. In 1992, my debut book, &ldquo;A RETURN TO LOVE: Reflections on the Principles of A Course in Miracles,&rdquo; took flight and became an instant bestseller, ultimately ranking as the fifth highest-selling book in America that year. Since then, I&rsquo;ve authored 14 additional books.</p>
<p><strong>My Identity and Experiences</strong></p>
<p>My journey has taken me far and wide. I&rsquo;ve conducted classes and lectures across America and around the world. Although most of my writings revolve around universal spiritual themes, two of my books, &ldquo;Healing the Soul of America&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Politics of Love,&rdquo; extend my spiritual exploration into the realm of politics. Simultaneously, my non-profit endeavors have continued to champion crucial causes such as AIDS care, peace, hunger relief, and racial reconciliation.</p>
<p>Through extensive travel and interactions with thousands of people, I&rsquo;ve borne witness to many facets of life. I&rsquo;ve stood beside people during their most trying moments, from grappling with grave diagnoses to facing addiction crises, sudden marital separations, and abrupt career setbacks. My aim has always been to provide solace, inspiration, and the tools for personal growth.</p>
<p><strong>A Changing America</strong></p>
<p>Around two decades ago, I began to discern a disheartening trend—an increasing prevalence of misery among individuals. Although I was accustomed to confronting life&rsquo;s tragedies even among those who appeared happy and privileged, I encountered far too many who seemed to suffer needlessly. Hardworking individuals striving for meaningful and productive lives found themselves ensnared by societal and economic conditions beyond their control. In many cases, their troubles were the result of systemic injustices, not of their own making.</p>
<p>Something fundamental had shifted in America.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, a typical American worker could afford a home, a car, an annual vacation, and the opportunity to send their children to college. One parent could even choose to stay at home with the kids. Economic anxiety was not the pervasive norm as it is today.</p>
<p>So, why has this changed? The answer lies in a rigged system.</p>
<p>According to the Rand Corporation, over the past 48 years, more than $50 trillion has been funneled from the bottom 90 percent of Americans to the top one percent. Average American workers now earn less, in real terms, for the same work, while CEOs and shareholders amass immense wealth in an exploitative system that harms both people and the planet. Trickle-down economics, touted as a solution, has failed to uplift all, leaving many to struggle without a lifeline. An aberration in American history, where neoliberal economic philosophy prioritizes short-term corporate profits over democracy, has led our nation into a period of social, political, and economic decline.</p>
<p>From tax breaks for the wealthy to extensive corporate subsidies, from rampant privatization to union dismantling and excessive deregulation, the average American worker has been stripped of economic opportunities. Throughout my travels, I witnessed firsthand how chronic economic anxiety has given rise to despair among what once constituted America&rsquo;s middle class.</p>
<p>Medical debt affecting 500,000 people annually, 68,000 deaths annually due to lack of medical care, 85 million Americans underinsured or uninsured, 18 million unable to afford prescribed medications, 64 percent living paycheck to paycheck, 60 percent unable to handle a sudden $400 expense, $88 billion in credit card debt, and 600,000 homeless individuals—these statistics aren&rsquo;t mere numbers. They represent lives mired in despair.</p>
<p>🌟 Vision 🌟</p>
