<p>Repealing pay increases for elected and appointed officials
After the 2014 general election, acting Governor Ray Tenorio introduced a bill to increase salaries of elected and appointed officials retroactively. The bill was passed by the legislature in San Nicolas&rsquo; absence. In December, San Nicolas introduced a bill to repeal the raises, which failed passage. Starting later that month, San Nicolas began to donate the pay increase to local charities.</p>
<p>San Nicolas introduced a bill in 2015 to repeal the elected and appointed officials&rsquo; pay raises, among other related matters. The bill was enacted, but the provision repealing the pay raises was removed before passage. San Nicolas revisited repealing the pay raises for elected and appointed officials by introducing a new bill later in the year, but it failed passage in November. The Guam Legislature reconsidered and passed the new bill in January 2016. Governor Calvo vetoed the new bill. An attempted override of the new bill failed.</p>
<p>Senator San Nicolas introduced a bill in 2017, which would reduce the salaries of elected and appointed officials that had been raised by Public Law 32-208.

A resolution has been introduced in the Guam Legislature by Senator Therese Terlaje in support of H.R. 1713.</p>

<p>During a financial services committee meeting, San Nicolas stated that the territories had been neglected by financial services companies, citing that the website Zillow, which had executives in attendance, does not include Guam in for its offerings for mortgage loans.</p>
<p>San Nicolas asked a number of large financial institutions to explore the possibility of lowering interest rates in rural areas. A number of chief executives of big banks expressed interest in exploring charging lower rates to rural borrowers.</p>
