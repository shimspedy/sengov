          <p>U.S. Representative David Scott</p>
<p>In 2002, David Scott was elected to the United States Congress. He is currently in his tenth term representing Georgia&rsquo;s Thirteenth Congressional District, which includes 6 counties around metro Atlanta: Cobb, Clayton, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton and Henry.   He began his public service by being elected to the Georgia General Assembly in 1974.</p>
<h4 id="united-states-congress">United States Congress</h4>
<p>In Congress, David Scott is a strong voice for farmers, jobs, healthcare, education, our veterans, our children, and transportation. He serves on the Financial Services Committee, Agriculture Committee, and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.  He has authored several laws including student loan repayment assistance for law students who become public prosecutors and defenders so that top attorneys will be attracted to public service.  Congressman Scott secured $80 million in funding in the 2018 Farm Bill for agriculture-focused scholarships at the 19 Historically Black 1890’s Land-Grant Colleges and Universities across the country. He also recognized the importance of Fathers by adding Father’s Day to the U.S. Flag Code as a day of special significance.  He bridged political gridlock to achieve National Heritage Area designation for the Arabia Mountain in metro Atlanta.</p>
<p>Respect for veterans is important to Congressman Scott. After scandals were revealed at the Atlanta VA, Congressman Scott worked in a bipartisan effort to pass major reforms of the VA and he was the first Democrat to call for the resignation of the VA Secretary. He authored bills that later became law to allow veterans and their children to receive in-state tuition. He also co-authored a law to help increase the number of mental health professionals at the VA by paying for their student loans.</p>
<p>As Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Congressman Scott recognizes the vital role agriculture plays in the success of our country and in Georgia, and he fights everyday to protect the interests of farmers, ranchers, and food processors.  He also works to ensure that America’s agriculture sector continues to grow and remains globally competitive. He co-authored a law to reform the federal dairy program, which will keep prices affordable to consumers. He also supports land grant universities, such as the University of Georgia and Fort Valley State University, recognizing the significance they play in fostering research and education, and improving the agricultural economy.</p>
<p>As a Senior Member of the Financial Services Committee, Congressman Scott has stood with homeowners and neighborhoods during the financial crisis.  He worked to enact the program to provide struggling homeowners who are unemployed with up to 18 months mortgage assistance.  He also helped create the mortgage assistance program Home Assistance Mortgage Program (HAMP), the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), and the Making Home Affordable Program.  Congressman Scott authored a law to allow insurance agents and brokers to have multi-state insurance licensing, which will provide more options for consumers. After major flooding hit metro Atlanta in 2009, he obtained financial support for his district and wrote the law to allow for flood insurance premiums to be paid in monthly installments rather than one lump sum.  He ensured that Georgians receive two free credit reports each year, rather than the one annual report available to most of the country.</p>
<p>As a Member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly Congressman Scott supports a strong American military and robust foreign policy and has demonstrated a firm commitment to America’s relationships abroad particularly, with Israel and our NATO allies.  Congressman Scott has provided strong leadership in passing a resolution at the 2012 NATO meeting, gaining the support of 27 other nations, to join the United States and Israel to stop Iran from securing a nuclear bomb.</p>

<p>David Scott was born on June 27, 1945 on a farm in Aynor, South Carolina to Mamie Polite Scott and Albert James Scott.  Soon after he was born, David’s mother and father moved up north to take work as live-in domestics (maid/ cook and chauffeur/butler) for wealthy families, leaving David in the care of his maternal grandparents, Helen and James Burroughs, on the farm.</p>
<p>At age 5, David Scott was relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania where he lived with his paternal grandparents, Minnie and Charles Scott.

At age 10, his paternal grandmother died and David was moved back to the care of his maternal grandmother on the farm in South Carolina for one year.</p>
<p>Then at age 11, David Scott was relocated to Scarsdale, New York where his parents found another job as live-in domestics for a wealthy family.  However, this family allowed David to live with his parents in Scarsdale, marking the first period in his life that he actually lived day-to-day with his parents. David attended Fox Meadow School and Scarsdale Junior High School.</p>
<p>At age 13, David moved with his parents to Daytona Beach, Florida where they bought a home and his father started a garbage collection business.

David Scott graduated with honors from Campbell High School in Daytona Beach, Florida in 1963.</p>

<h4 id="georgia-state-political-career">Georgia State Political Career</h4>

Representative Scott helped create Peachcare, the health insurance program for children.</p>
<p>In 1982, David Scott was elected as a Georgia State Senator, where he served from 1983 to 2002.  In the Senate, he successfully passed several major laws including a moment of silence for reflection or prayer in Georgia’s public schools.  He wrote the Georgia law that gives women with breast cancer surgery the right to determine their length of stay in the hospital and level of medical care in consultation with their physician, rather than having insurance companies make such critical health decisions.  He authored the law to limit and restrict landfills in residential neighborhoods, cleaning rivers and streams, and protecting underground water aquifers.  He also passed the state law to provide sex education and AIDS prevention instruction in Georgia public schools.</p>
