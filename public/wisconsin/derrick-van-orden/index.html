          <p>Congressman Derrick Van Orden proudly represents the people of Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District.</p>
<p>An American patriot and retired Navy SEAL, Derrick has dedicated his life to serving and protecting Americans. Now as a congressman, he continues the fight and advocate for our farmers, veterans, workers, tradesmen, job creators, seniors, and families of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Derrick’s life of public service began when he joined the Navy at the age of 18. He had the honor to serve our great nation for 26 years, retiring as a Navy SEAL Senior Chief. During that time, he completed five combat deployments.</p>
<p>Additionally, he served in the Horn of Africa, Asia, Europe, and South and Central America. During his tour in Europe in 2012, he was responsible for planning Special Operations contingency operations for the European Continent. Derrick also became involved in acting during his military service – starring in major motion picture films.</p>
<p>After retirement, Derrick and his wife Sara Jane, with whom he will celebrate over 30 years of marriage on February 15, decided to reopen their local village cafe. This led to a two-year adventure culminating with the reestablishment of the cafe as a gathering place for friends and family.</p>
<p>Together, Derrick and Sara Jane live in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. They have four children and eight grandchildren.</p>
<h4 id="about-congressman-derrick-van-orden">About Congressman Derrick Van Orden</h4>
<p>Derrick Van Orden is an American patriot, retired Navy SEAL, husband, father, grandfather, and Christian. He met and married his wife, Sara Jane over 27 years ago.</p>
<p>Derrick and his brother were raised in rural poverty by their beloved mother, Carol, who taught them the importance of hard work and self-reliance. She was a fiery Irish farm girl who also taught them to speak plainly and never back down from a just fight.</p>
<p>Derrick’s journey of public service started when he joined the Navy at the age of 18. He had the honor to serve our great nation for 26 years. He retired as a Navy SEAL Senior Chief with 5 combat deployments and several others to troubled areas in the world.</p>
<p>His first combat deployment was to Bosnia Herzegovina immediately following the signing of the Dayton Accords. During this time, he came to understand how truly unique and wonderful America is, and why She is not only worth emulating, but protecting.</p>
<p>Derrick continued his service with multiple combat tours to Afghanistan and Iraq. Additionally, he served in the Horn of Africa, Asia, Europe, and South and Central America.</p>
<p>During his tour in Europe in 2012, under the Obama administration, he was responsible for planning Special Operations contingency operations for the European Continent.</p>
<p>This is where he learned that when America has ineffectual leaders, Americans pay the price for this lack of strength. The direct result of this was the tragic killing of his former teammate Ty Woods and fellow SEAL Glen Doherty during the terrorist attack on the embassy annex in Benghazi, Libya.</p>
<p>Derrick also became involved in acting during his military service when he starred in the motion picture Act of Valor. He continued his acting career and appeared in two more films. Derrick is also a best-selling author of the book A Book of Man: A Navy SEAL’s Guide to the Lost Art of Manhood.</p>
<p>After retirement, Derrick utilized his leadership skills in the private sector consulting with Fortune 500 companies until he and Sara retired to their farm.</p>
<p>Wanting to give back to the village that had been so kind to them, Derrick and Sara decided to reopen the village cafe. This led to a two-year adventure culminating with the reestablishment of the Butternut Cafe as a gathering place for friends and family.</p>
<p>Following this, Derrick decided that in order to pursue his love of learning and America, he would attend law school.</p>
<p>Derrick saw what was happening in Washington DC. The radical agenda being pushed by Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden has taken our nation rapidly down the path to Socialism.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stand by the sidelines while Washington Democrats fundamentally change the fabric of our nation with one-party rule. He was called back into public service, this time as a candidate for Congress in the 3rd District of his beloved State of Wisconsin.</p>
<h4 id="an-education-our-children-deserve">An Education our Children Deserve</h4>
<p>In times of crisis, our leaders should revert to our founding documents: The Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Declaration of Independence. Democrats like Tony Evers have ignored our founding principles and instead imposed onerous and capricious restrictions on our families and schools.</p>
<p>Derrick believes we need to restore our freedoms after the last year of imposed restrictions, and that starts with getting our children back to school. Data shows that risks of children in schools are minimal, and we need to act now to help our children get the education they deserve.</p>
<h4 id="rebuilding-our-economy">Rebuilding our Economy</h4>
<p>Wisconsin families have had to adapt to considerable change: a global pandemic, overreaching government mandates, and lack of support from Washington. Now is the time to get back to work, safely and responsibly.</p>
<p>As a former small business owner, Derrick will be the voice that our communities deserve. He knows the people of Wisconsin are the hardest working in the country. Derrick will never stop fighting to make sure the people of the 3rd District can display the hard work, innovation, and ingenuity that Wisconsin has to offer on a fair playing field. Derrick will work tirelessly to stop Democrat tax hikes and make sure more of your hard earned money remains where it should be: in your pocket.</p>
<h4 id="leading-with-integrity">Leading with Integrity</h4>
<p>Derrick has put duty above personal gain for his entire life. After 26 years in the Navy, 21 as a Navy SEAL, Derrick returned to his home in Wisconsin to open a small business and give back to the community. He knows that being a Representative means exactly that: representing the people who elected him to serve.</p>
<h4 id="improving-healthcare-and-reducing-costs">Improving Healthcare and Reducing Costs</h4>
<p>Derrick will work to make sure individuals with preexisting conditions are protected when Obamacare is fully repealed and a new system is implemented  allowing for true competition in healthcare, driving costs down.</p>
<h4 id="veterans-issues">Veterans Issues</h4>
<p>Derrick’s Navy service gave him a unique perspective on caring for our veterans. Derrick gets his healthcare from the VA and will continue to do so as a Congressman.</p>
<p>As a Corpsman with the Navy SEALs, Derrick has saved countless lives on the battlefield and knows that treatment for veterans doesn’t end there. He knows we need to cut red tape at the VA, making treatment for physical and mental scars more accessible for veterans.</p>
<h4 id="safe-communities">Safe Communities</h4>
<p>Derrick has been a staunch supporter of law enforcement throughout his life, and has brought together leaders in the 3rd District to listen to the challenges they face protecting and serving Wisconsin communities. Derrick will ensure our law enforcement remains fully funded so that our officers are properly trained and equipped to perform their duties.</p>
<h4 id="farming-and-agriculture">Farming and Agriculture</h4>
<p>Wisconsin is America’s Dairyland and the 3rd District is a major producer of dairy and agricultural products. Derrick is committed to working on behalf of farmers, and will work to be appointed to the Agriculture committee where he will be a leading voice for Wisconsin’s dairy industry.</p>
<h4 id="border-security">Border Security</h4>
<p>Without borders, we are by definition, not a nation. We must regain control of our borders to keep our nation safe. Derrick will fight to fix the humanitarian crisis and disaster Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi have created at the border.</p>
<h4 id="term-limits">Term Limits</h4>
<p>Derrick supports term limits on all legislators, ensuring that being elected to Congress remains an act of public service, not a way to enrich one’s self.</p>
