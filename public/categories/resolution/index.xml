      <description>The concurrent resolution denounces the horrors of socialism. The resolution states that socialist ideology results in the concentration of power which has frequently led to the establishment of communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships. The resolution highlights the fact that many of the worst crimes in history have been committed by socialist ideologues, including Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, and others. The resolution also mentions the devastating consequences of the implementation of socialism in various countries, such as the Bolshevik Revolution, the USSR gulags, the famine and devastation caused by the Great Leap Forward in China, the killing fields in Cambodia, and the current state of Venezuela.</description>
