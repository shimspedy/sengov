      <description>Deidre DeJear for governor Iowans want someone to get to work for them. Deidre has dedicated her life to serving her community and that is what she will do as Governor starting on Day One.
Deidre was born in Jackson, Mississippi, and as a child moved with her family to Oklahoma. At eight years old, Deidreâ€™s mother passed away shortly after giving birth to her younger sister. Overcoming this adversity at such a young age and seeing her dad be present for her and her siblings shaped who Deidre is today.</description>
