      <description>Lou Leon Guerrero for governor The Honorable Lourdes “Lou” Aflague Leon Guerrero is the ninth Governor of Guam. She is the first female governor of the territory and is a registered nurse, a businesswoman, a policymaker, a mother, and a grandmother.
Since taking office in January 2019, she’s nearly eliminated GovGuam’s deficit from $83 million to $1.5 million. Additionally, she increased the minimum wage, legalized cannabis, ended two federal receiverships, and paid millions in war reparations owed to Guam’s WWII survivors with adjudicated claims.</description>
