      <description>Kay Ivey for governor When Kay Ivey was first sworn-in as the 54th Governor of the State of Alabama in April 2017, she got right to work cleaning up Montgomery and restoring the people’s trust in government. That’s because Kay is a conservative fighter, whose life has prepared her to lead our state towards prosperity and opportunity for every Alabamian.
She grew up working on the family farm in Wilcox County.</description>
