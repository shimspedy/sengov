      <description>Tim Scott for senator Tim grew up in poverty in a single-parent household in North Charleston. His mom worked 16-hour days as a nursing assistant to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. Tim admits his circumstances left him hopeless, and as a result, he nearly failed out of high school. By the grace of God, Tim met his mentor, a Chick-fil-A operator named John Moniz. Moniz taught Tim Biblical principles and Conservative values.</description>
