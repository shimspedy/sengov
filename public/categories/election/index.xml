      <description>I am running for the office of President of the United States, and I firmly believe that bold action is what&amp;rsquo;s required to address the challenges we face today. We don&amp;rsquo;t have much time before the same old political operatives start influencing the choices for the 2024 elections, which are nearly two years away.
These are historically challenging times. In recent years, government spending has surged, leading to the worst inflation since the days of President Jimmy Carter.</description>

      <description>America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable. It is a choice made by detached and cynical politicians. As a California resident, I’ve seen firsthand how decades of Democrat rule have turned the Golden State, for many, into an unaffordable dystopia. I won’t let them do the same to America. We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there.</description>

As he continues to be a prominent voice in American politics, it&amp;rsquo;s worth revisiting the policies he put forth during his presidential campaign.
Our Mission to Make America Great Again I left behind my former life because I could not sit by and watch career politicians continue bleeding this country dry and allow other nations to take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense.</description>
