<h4 id="children">Children</h4>

She is founder and Chair of the Congressional Children’s Caucus, a large, bipartisan forum for Members of Congress to address the daunting challenges that face our children today, including child health care, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, early childhood development, juvenile crime, poverty, hunger, child abuse, neglect, adoption and foster care.</p>

<h4 id="energy">Energy</h4>
<p>As a representative from Houston, the &ldquo;energy capital of the world,&rdquo; Congresswoman Jackson Lee has made responsible energy policy a legislative priority in Washington. In the past, Congresswoman Jackson Lee has served as Chair of the Energy Brain trust of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Jackson Lee believes that it is imperative that we recognize the vital importance of America achieving energy independence in the 21st century. We must end our addiction to foreign sources of oil, most of which are found in regions of the world which are unstable and in some cases, opposed to our interests. Accordingly, there is no issue more integral to our economic and national security than energy independence.</p>
<p>Energy is the lifeblood of every economy. Producing more of it leads to more good jobs, cheaper goods, lower fuel prices, and greater economic and national security. It is crucial that while seeking solutions to secure more energy independence within this country, we also strike a balance that will still support an environment for continued growth in the oil and gas industry, which creates millions of jobs across the country.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Jackson Lee has consistently called for the development of pragmatic, environmentally conscious, and economically efficient strategies for addressing and resolving our national energy crisis. We have many more miles to go before we achieve energy independence. Congresswoman Jackson Lee is willing, able, and eager to continue working with Houston’s and our nation’s energy industry to ensure that we are moving expeditiously on the path to crafting an environmentally sound and economically viable energy policy. Furthermore, she believes that it is imperative that we involve small, minority and women owned, and independent energy companies in this process, because they represent some of the hard working Americans and Houstonians who are on the forefront of energy efficient strategies to achieving energy independence.</p>

<p>Iraq: Congresswoman Jackson Lee has long been an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq, which she and many of her Democratic colleagues have opposed from the outset. She stands by President Barack Obama’s decision to end the large roll of our troops in Iraq and warmly welcomes home those troops who have returned to their families. Congresswoman Jackson Lee also honors those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country; even though these heroes are gone they will never be forgotten. She has authored legislation honoring troops for their military accomplishments, while emphasizing the need to step up the resources and programs for those service members transitioning from military service to the Civilian sector.</p>
<p>Pakistan: As founder and co-chair of the Pakistan Caucus, Congresswoman Jackson Lee has emphasized the value of Pakistan as an ally in the global war on terror.

Congresswoman Jackson Lee traveled to Darfur in August 2007, where she visited internally displaced persons camps and met with government and civil society leaders as well as representatives from humanitarian organizations.

She co-chairs the U.S.-Afghanistan caucus, and she has visited the country, where she was particularly moved by the conditions faced by women and children. Congresswoman Jackson Lee recently successfully amended the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act of 2007, which passed the House, to encourage funding for efforts to protect Afghanistan’s female legislators. Congresswoman Jackson Lee supports the ongoing UN presence in the region after the mass draw down of U.S. troops after the 13 year engagement.

She has been a staunch supporter of legislation that aims to eliminate health disparities in this country, fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic, combat the childhood obesity crisis facing this nation, and provide health insurance coverage for all Americans. She believes that quality healthcare should be affordable and accessible to all. Since the Affordable Care Act was rolled out by the president uninsured citizens numbers have dropped from 18 million to 11.9 million people, a 66% decrease in uninsured citizens.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Jackson Lee fully understands the urgent need to provide a high-quality, accessible, and affordable health care system for all and is working hard to tackle the problem of the uninsured and the under-insured. There are currently forty-seven million uninsured Americans, nine million of whom are children. Another fifty million are underinsured. Of utmost concern to Congresswoman Jackson Lee, is ensuring that every child in this country have access to adequate health insurance.</p>
<h4 id="homeland-security">Homeland Security</h4>

<p>Congress is focusing on finding security gaps, and is holding the Administration accountable, demanding serious solutions. Congresswoman Jackson Lee is working hard to ensure that Americans get the security that they have been promised and that they deserve. Twenty years have passed since the catastrophic events of 9/11, and Congresswoman Jackson Lee and her colleagues are committed to honoring the over 3,000 innocent Americans who died that day by ensuring that such a tragedy is never allowed to occur again.</p>
<h4 id="immigration">Immigration</h4>
<p>Congresswoman Jackson Lee is one of the most outspoken proponents of comprehensive immigration reform in the Congress. She strongly believes that only a comprehensive approach to solving the current immigration crisis in the U.S. will produce results. While a strong supporter of securing our borders, she considers essential the need for bringing close to 12 million illegal immigrants out of the shadows of society through earned access to legalization. She also believes that unity of families is an essential American value and should be one of the fundamentals of immigration reform, along with increasing the diversity of immigration from parts of the world that have been historically underrepresented such as the Caribbean, Africa or treated unequally such as Haiti.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Jackson Lee has a long record of intervention to advance humanitarian causes in the immigration context, from preventing the breakup of individual families as a result of a wrongful deportation, to ensuring that victims of civil wars and national disasters around the globe receive a temporary protected status under the U.S. immigration Laws. She has authored several bills about immigration including the H.R. 750, the &ldquo;Save America Comprehensive Immigration Act&rdquo;, which sets forth a comprehensive and humane solution to immigration reform. Congresswoman Jackson Lee has also consistently advocated better protection for American workers and employers within the immigration context.</p>
<h4 id="space-and-nasa">Space and NASA</h4>
<p>Congresswoman Jackson Lee believes that space exploration remains part of our national destiny, and she is working in Congress to ensure that the future of NASA is one of continued progress. She has steadfastly emphasized that while safety must be the number one priority of NASA, this should not deter us from pushing the boundaries of technology and discovery.  With both the Space Shuttle Atlantis and the International Space Station experiencing serious safety scares, Congresswoman Jackson Lee continues to work for improved safety standards and oversight.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Jackson Lee feels that the space exploration and research done at NASA will inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers, and will provide the technological advances needed to keep America’s economy strong.</p>
<h4 id="veterans">Veterans</h4>
<p>Members of the armed forces are important to our nation, and we show them our appreciation by taking care of them after they have completed their service. As a Member of Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee has fought to ensure that veterans have the access to the quality healthcare that they deserve.</p>
<p>Our nation has a proud legacy of appreciation and commitment to the men and women who have worn the uniform in defense of this country. We must be united in seeing that every soldier, sailor, airman, and marine is welcomed back with all the care and compassion this grateful nation can bestow. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee believes in helping our veterans even after their honorable service. This is why she has sponsored H.R. 76 Helping to Encourage Real Opportunity for Veterans Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act.</p>
<p>When the Second World War finally came to an end in 1945, celebrations erupted on the streets of cities and towns across our nation. One of the most enduring images of that war is not a picture of bombs or destruction, but of a jubilant soldier kissing a woman in New York City’s Times Square. The veterans we continue to honor as the &ldquo;Greatest Generation&rdquo; returned home not only to open arms, but also to the G.I. Bill, which offered them college or vocational education, as well as one year of unemployment compensation. It also provided loans for returning veterans to buy homes and start businesses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our nation’s recognition of those who served in subsequent conflicts has been less than adequate. We have, in recent decades, too often failed to overcome our political differences to recognize the truly remarkable achievements of our courageous veterans. Though Congresswoman Jackson Lee opposed the war in Iraq from its inception, she remains absolutely committed to ensuring our sons and daughters returning from different international conflicts will receive the recognition they deserve and the services and support that they need.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Jackson Lee recently introduced groundbreaking legislation entitled “Helping to Encourage Real Opportunity for Veterans Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act of 2015 (HEROS).” Her legislation recognizes the need to honor our service beyond their tenure in uniform. Our veterans should not have to struggle to find gainful employment after fighting so gallantly to protect our freedoms. The Heroes Act calls for the appointment of  a &ldquo;military relations manager&rdquo; as an expert in the process of transitioning from being a member of the Armed Forces to being a civilian and in translating the skills, experience, and training gained in the Armed Forces to skills, experience, and training needed in the private sector. This act allows employers a business-related tax credit for the number of veterans who begin work resulting from the efforts of a military relations manager.</p>
<p>Veterans continue to have many unanswered needs, and Congresswoman Jackson Lee continues to fight for the rights of our most patriotic Americans. Veterans have kept their promise to serve our nation; they have willingly risked their lives to protect the country we all love. We must now ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans.</p>
<h4 id="voting-and-civil-rights">Voting and Civil Rights</h4>
<p>Domestic Wiretapping:
As a senior member of the Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees, Congresswoman Jackson Lee fully understands that we live in a dangerous world. However, she is also proud of, and deeply committed to, the democratic values that have made the United States a beacon for the world. She believes that adherence to these democratic values must be the pillar by which America gives no quarter to terrorists who would do our country harm while at the same time ensuring fidelity to the distinctively American commitment to the rule of law, the dignity of the individual, and separation of powers.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Jackson Lee believes that it should be the policy of the United States that the objective of any authorized program of foreign intelligence surveillance must be to ensure that American citizens and persons in America are secure in their persons, papers, and effects but makes terrorists everywhere else in the world feel insecure. The best way to achieve these twin goals is follow the rule of law. And the exclusive law to follow with respect to authorizing foreign surveillance gathering on U.S. soil is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which can and should be modernized to accommodate new technologies and to make clear that foreign to foreign communications are not subject to the FISA, even though modern technology enables that communication to be routed through the United States.</p>
<p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is indispensable and must play a meaningful role in ensuring compliance with the law and the Congress must have regular access to information about how many U.S. communications are being collected and the authority to require court orders when it becomes clear that a certain program or surveillance of a target is scooping up communications of Americans.</p>
<p>Congress should not grant amnesty to any telecommunications company for helping the NSA spy illegally on innocent Americans because the availability of amnesty will have the unintended consequence of encouraging telecommunications companies to comply with, rather than contest, illegal requests to spy on Americans. Finally, authorization to conduct foreign surveillance gathering on U.S. soil must never be made permanent. The threats to America’s security and the liberties of its people will change over time and requires constant vigilance by the people’s representatives in Congress. Congresswoman Jackson Lee supports the USA Freedom Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama. With this new legislation there will be fewer opportunities for the collection of unauthorized personal information data collection by oversight agencies.</p>
<p>Federal Hate Crimes Legislation: <br>
Hate crimes are destructive and divisive. A random act of violence resulting in injury or even death is a tragic event that devastates the lives of the victim and their family, but the intentional selection and beating or murder of an individual because of who they are terrorizes an entire community and sometimes the nation.  For example, it is easy to recognize the difference between check-kiting and a cross burning; or an arson of an office building versus the intentional torching of a church or synagogue. The church or synagogue burning has a profound impact on the congregation, the faith community, the greater community, and the nation.</p>
<p>Voting Rights for District of Columbia Citizens:
Congresswoman Jackson Lee believes that we must not lose sight of one indisputable and shameful fact: nearly 500,000 people living in the District of Columbia lack direct voting representation in the House of Representatives and Senate. Residents of the District of Columbia serve in the military, pay billions of dollars in federal taxes each year, and assume other responsibilities of U.S. citizenship. For over 200 years, the District has been denied voting representation in Congress–the entity that has ultimate authority over all aspects of the city’s legislative, executive, and judicial functions.</p>
<p>If a person can be called upon to pay federal taxes and serve in the armed forces of the United States, then he or she should at least have the opportunity to vote for a representative who could at least cast a symbolic vote in this chamber on critical matters facing our nation. Issues like war and peace, equality and justice.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Jackson Lee believes that taxation without representation is tyranny. As a supporter of freedom, democracy, and equality, she continues to argue that it is long overdue for the citizens of the District of Columbia to have a representative in Congress who can vote on the vital legislation considered in this body.</p>
<p>Voting Rights for the Nation:
Recently Congresswoman Jackson Lee had the honor to present the Barbara Jordan Gold Medallion for Public-Private Leadership to a pioneer in her own right Hillary Rodham Clinton. This prestigious award is presented annually to a woman of demonstrated excellence in the public or private sector whose achievements are an example and inspiration to people everywhere, but especially to women and girls.</p>
<p>A terrible blow was dealt to the Voting Rights Act on June 25, 2013, when the Supreme Court handed down the decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 537 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b), the provision of the law determining which jurisdictions would be subject to Section 5 “pre-clearance.” The reason the Court gave for its ruling “times have changed.” Times have changed, but what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive changes it cited were due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed today.</p>
