          <div class="e-content" id="manifestation">
          <p>Congresswoman Lisa McClain is serving her first term representing Michigan’s 10th Congressional District.</p>
<p>A member of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. McClain is a strong supporter of our armed forces and a voice for Michigan’s defense assets including Selfridge Air National Guard Base. On the Armed Services Committee, Rep. McClain serves on both the Subcommittee on Military Personnel and Subcommittee on Readiness.</p>
<p>McClain also serves on the House Education and Labor Committee, where she will work to advocate for schools to reopen for in-person learning full-time. On the Education and Labor Committee, McClain serves on both the Higher Education and Workforce Investment Subcommittee and the Civil Rights and Human Services Subcommittee.</p>
<p>Prior to Congress, Lisa spent more than 30 years in the business world. Rep. McClain knows how to run a business and supports policies that allow businesses to grow and people to prosper.</p>
<p>Lisa is also the Founder and President of North End Support Team in Macomb County which helps residents suffering from drug abuse and addiction.</p>
<p>McClain lives in Romeo with her husband Mike, four kids and dog, Peanut. The most important part of the week is Sunday dinner when the family comes together to enjoy food and each other’s company.</p>
<h2 id="economic-growth--jobs">Economic Growth &amp; Jobs</h2>
<p>A strong growing economy is an urgent domestic priority of Congress right now. Americans want economic growth, higher take home pay and lower taxes. I will support reducing taxes on hard working Americans, rolling back regulations and barriers on small business growth. In addition, I will support free and fair international trade policies that are crucial for all sectors of American’s economy. This will create jobs, end economic uncertainty, and make America more competitive.</p>
<h2 id="immigration--border-security">Immigration &amp; Border Security</h2>
<p>We must secure our borders, period! Our immigration system is broken. The open borders Biden Administration is turning a blind eye to illegal immigration. I&rsquo;ve visited the border twice and saw firsthand what happens when you incentivize illegal immigration. American citizens and immigrants who come here legally and played by the rules deserve a government that protects them.</p>
<p>We need to build a wall where possible and provide cutting edge technology and resources to the Border Patrol, ICE and the Coast Guard to ensure that we enforce our nation&rsquo;s immigration laws that keep American citizens safe. The border is a national security issue, not just an immigration issue.</p>
<h2 id="2nd-amendment">2nd Amendment</h2>
<p>I am a strong defender of the 2nd Amendment. I strongly support an individual&rsquo;s right to own guns, which is clearly protected by the Constitution. I believe the 2nd Amendment enables law-abiding citizens throughout the country to own firearms to protect themselves and their families. I oppose federal licensing of law-abiding gun owners and national gun registration. I am completely opposed to any action that puts any level of restrictions on our right to keep and bear arms.</p>
<p>I will be a champion for freedom and a fierce defender of our Constitutional rights. While defending our 2nd Amendment rights for law-abiding citizens, I will work to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.</p>
<h2 id="vaccines">Vaccines</h2>
<p>I am absolutely opposed to any government mandated vaccinations. These mandates go against an individual’s religious, philosophical or medical beliefs; including parents’ rights to choose all, or no, vaccinations for their children.</p>
<p>I am fighting against Biden&rsquo;s unconstitutional COVID vaccine mandates every day in Congress, and will continue pushing back against this gross government overreach.</p>
<h2 id="term-limits">Term Limits</h2>
<p>I 100% support term limits. There are special interest groups out there trying to tell lies because I will not be beholden to them and their specific plan. I support term limits and will work with my constituents to discover how long those limits should be.</p>
<h2 id="investing-in-infrastructure">Investing in Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Michigan’s roads and bridges are in dire need of repair. I will work with anyone willing to help continue building our nation’s infrastructure. Access to reliable and safe infrastructure is vital for a strong, healthy economy. Improved infrastructure is crucial to city revitalization projects, creating jobs and attractive for business and manufacturing investment. While I support improving infrastructure, I will never support legislation that disguises itself as infrastructure and wastes taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>I will work to expedite the federal approval process for infrastructure projects to ensure we have the ability to quickly repair our crumbling roads and bridges. We need to modernize outdated infrastructure and increase broadband to rural communities, so every resident and business has access to the tools and resources they need to achieve success.</p>
<h2 id="affordable-health-care">Affordable Health Care</h2>
<p>The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is not affordable for the vast majority of American consumers. Millions of people have decided they no longer can afford health insurance under this disastrous law. It drives up premiums and deductible costs for individuals, families and job providers. It fuels waste, fraud and abuse. And it cannot be fixed. It must be repealed as soon as possible and replaced with a free market approach to health care coverage that starts with individual responsibility.</p>
<p>Allowing health care coverage to be purchased across state lines by individuals and small businesses will create stronger competition among insurance companies, which will lower costs to the consumer. Another component would be to expand the use of health savings accounts. I believe a combination of free-market solutions and empowering states to give access to people with low incomes will work best.</p>

<p>Federal welfare and assistance programs were originally developed to assist those who could not historically work for themselves and to be a safety net for those who had fallen on tough times. Unfortunately, however, these programs, which were designed to help people in their times of need, have turned into perpetual and unsustainable government spending. If we do not address these current programs, they will spiral out of control.</p>
<p>Many Americans have worked hard, often starting at minimum wage jobs, to provide for their families. I believe we must focus on growing the economy so people can get good-paying jobs, so they no longer need government assistance. It is unfortunate that some people choose to stay on government assistance programs and crowd out those in real need. I will work in Congress to reach solutions that keep these programs for those who truly need them.</p>
<h2 id="enforcing-the-usmca-trade-agreement">Enforcing the USMCA Trade Agreement</h2>
<p>I support the United States Mexican Canadian Agreement. President Trump delivered a bipartisan victory for American families, workers, manufacturers and small business job providers. This trade agreement creates new opportunities for farmers while supporting economic job growth in Southeast Michigan. Approximately 338,000 jobs in Michigan are due to our trade with our trading partners to the north and south of our borders. The USMCA will create more than 75,000 jobs for American autoworkers. Trade with Canada and Mexico is vital to our economy in Michigan.</p>
<h2 id="honoring-our-veterans">Honoring Our Veterans</h2>
<p>I am passionate about improving the lives of our nation&rsquo;s veterans. In Congress, I am working to create policies to help our veterans re-enter society and the workforce. We must also provide veterans with high quality health care. The work of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is essential to meet our commitments to the men and women who served our country. I will fight for accountability and transparency within the VA. We cannot allow bureaucracy to get in the way of meeting the needs of our veterans. Our veterans represent the very best of our great nation. America must keep its promise to support and provide for those who served.</p>
<h2 id="cut-spending--balance-the-budget">Cut Spending &amp; Balance the Budget</h2>
<p>Most people balance their household budgets and watch carefully how they spend their hard-earned money to improve their quality of life. I look at the federal budget the same way - it must be balanced, and spending must be reduced, based on revenues. In addition, we need a smaller federal government and less debt.</p>
<p>Reducing federal spending along with cutting the national debt requires a sweeping change in how Congress passes spending bills. This change will require a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It’s time to get very serious about our annual budget deficits our $28 trillion dollar national debt.</p>
<h2 id="religious-freedom">Religious Freedom</h2>
<p>The First Amendment clearly states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion; or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” However, religious liberties in America are constantly under attack.</p>
<p>In Congress, I am a tireless advocate for defending in defending our religious liberties so America will remain a free country for people to pray and practice their faith without government interference.</p>
<h2 id="national-security">National Security</h2>
<p>To keep America and our allies safe from terrorism, and to maintain peace throughout the world, the United States needs a strong military. Our servicemen and women must have the full support of our government and the resources they need to protect our country and allies.</p>
<p>In Congress, I&rsquo;m proud to serve on the House Armed Services Committee, where I am committed to supporting our servicemembers and ensuring our military has the best equipment possible to defend our country. I am also tirelessly advocating for Selfridge Air National Guard Base and working to expand the programs housed at the base.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-agriculture">Supporting Agriculture</h2>
<p>Agriculture is one of the largest industries in Michigan&rsquo;s 10th Congressional District. In Congress, I work alongside Michigan&rsquo;s farmers and producers to ensure legislation being passed doesn&rsquo;t have unintended consequences to the ag community.</p>
<p>To ensure a strong agriculture economy, I will continue pushing for free trade between our trading partners. This will increase exports, promote competition and lower food prices.</p>
<p>I am also working to ensure changes to our nation&rsquo;s tax laws don&rsquo;t bankrupt the agriculture community.</p>
<p>To help farmers and ranchers access workers in a timely manner, I will work to improve the efficiency of H-2A visas and ease burdensome regulations.</p>
<h2 id="right-to-life">Right to Life</h2>
<p>I am 100% pro-life. I believe in the sanctity of human life and that life begins at conception. We must honor the first guarantee of the Declaration of Independence — which is a right to life. An unborn child has a fundamental right to life, which cannot be infringed.</p>
<p>Not a single tax dollar should pay for an abortion, which is why I&rsquo;m a strong supporter of the Hyde Amendment. The most essential duty of government is to defend the life of the innocent.</p>
<h2 id="great-lakes-protection">Great Lakes Protection</h2>
<p>The Great Lakes are a precious natural resource that must be protected. I oppose any large or small- scale diversion of water outside the Great Lakes basin. Whether it is stopping Asian Carp, invasive species or high-water levels, I will work on finding solutions to protect, preserve and strengthen the Great Lakes for future generations.</p>
