          <div class="e-content" id="manifestation">
          <p>Born and raised in Flint, Congressman Dan Kildee is a lifelong Michigander. In Congress, he has proven he can bring people together and get real results for his constituents and mid-Michigan.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defeating COVID-19—Congressman Kildee has worked to pass multiple economic relief bills for Michigan families, seniors and small businesses. He has successfully focused on getting direct economic aid to working families, speeding up vaccine distribution, reopening our schools safely and supporting small businesses that need our help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fighting Blight in Michigan—Congressman Kildee secured hundreds of millions of dollars to help strengthen neighborhoods, raise home values and make communities safer by removing abandoned houses across Michigan, including in Flint and Saginaw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring Clean Water—Congressman Kildee led the fight to stop a Canadian company from burying nuclear waste less than a mile from the Great Lakes, and co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force to more urgently clean up toxic PFAS chemicals in our drinking water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting Real Aid for Flint Families During the Water Crisis—During the water crisis in Flint, Congressman Kildee worked tirelessly to bring much needed relief to Flint families. He led the fight—bringing Democrats and Republicans together—to secure $100 million to help replace lead pipes and expand health care to residents. Kildee also worked to expand Medicaid for families, establish the Flint Registry and fund critical support services for children, including Head Start education and nutritious foods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Congressman Dan Kildee holds various leadership positions in Congress. As Chief Deputy Whip—part of the Democratic leadership team in Congress—he acts as an important liaison among Members of Congress and the leadership to build support for Democratic priorities and legislation. Congressman Kildee serves on three committees, including the Ways and Means Committee, the Budget Committee and the Science, Space and Technology Committee.</p>
<p>On the Ways and Means Committee, the oldest and one of the most powerful committees, Congressman Kildee works to lower the costs of health care premiums and prescription drugs, protect Social Security and Medicare, negotiate fair trade deals and create a tax system that benefits working families, not just the richest corporations.</p>
<p>Before being elected to Congress, Congressman Kildee co-founded and served as the president of the Center for Community Progress, a national non-profit organization focused on urban land reform and revitalization. He also founded Michigan&rsquo;s first land bank—the Genesee County Land Bank—which is responsible for tens of millions of dollars in redevelopment in Flint. The Genesee County Land Bank later served as a model for over 100 other land banks across the nation. Previously, Congressman Dan Kildee served as the Genesee County Treasurer, on the Genesee County Board of Commissioners and on the Flint Board of Education. Additionally, he worked for eight years at the Whaley Children&rsquo;s Center, a residential treatment facility in Flint for children who have experienced trauma and abuse.</p>
<p>Congressman Kildee resides in Flint Township with his wife, Jennifer. They have two children, Kenneth and Katy. Dan&rsquo;s oldest son, Ryan, and his wife Ginger are the parents of their first two grandchildren, Caitlin and Colin.</p>
<h2 id="veterans">VETERANS</h2>
<p>I am committed to making sure that the men and women who have served, are serving, or will serve in the U.S. military get the resources and care they need – both at home and abroad – and guarantee they receive the benefits they have earned.</p>
<p>As the son of a U.S. Navy veteran, I understand the importance of supporting those in uniform and providing them the dignity they are entitled to. This includes:</p>
<p>Boosting veteran benefits: I am committed to honoring our veteran’s service by ensuring they continue to receive all the benefits they have earned, which is why I’m a cosponsor of H.R. 1329, the Veterans’ Compensation Cost-Of-Living Adjustment Act. This bill would increase cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) rates for veterans with service-connected disabilities and for survivors of certain disabled veterans.</p>
<p>Preventing veterans suicide: I was pleased to vote for the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act in February 2016 and watch former President Obama sign it into law. The law expands access to mental health services for our nation’s veterans and seeks to curb the epidemic of veterans’ suicides in our country.</p>
<p>Protecting veterans’ from toxic chemical contamination: Oscoda, Michigan, is home to the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base, which has groundwater near the base that is unsafe to drink because of dangerous per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS. I have worked to bring safe drinking water to veterans and their families living around the base and launched the PFAS Task Force in Congress to bring Democrats and Republicans together to pass policies that protect veterans and public health.</p>
<h2 id="national-security-and-international-relations">NATIONAL SECURITY AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</h2>
<p>The U.S. is a profound force for good in the world. Our ability to impact peace and democracy across the globe is rooted in our economic strength and principles of democracy. Through these diplomatic initiatives, partnered with a strong national defense, the U.S. can keep Americans safe at home and abroad and continue to create positive change throughout the world.</p>
<h5 id="funding-the-military">Funding the Military:</h5>
<p>The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) outlines the budget and expenses for the Department of Defense. Congress must provide the resources our service members need to ensure a strong and smart national security and keep our country safe. I voted for the final version of the NDAA for fiscal year 2017 because in addition to supporting our military, it provided a significant pay raise for service members.</p>
<h5 id="foreign-aid">Foreign Aid:</h5>
<p>The United States foreign aid budget represents less than one percent of our entire federal budget and includes money to support our allies around the world who help us promote peace and economic prosperity. Our foreign aid budget includes funding for humanitarian assistance, the U.S. Department of State, and agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Access to basic education, including literacy initiatives and other youth skill programs, is an additional component of U.S. foreign aid priorities.</p>
<p>Foreign aid contributes not only to global humanitarian interests but also to our own national security and economic stability. By helping to foster peace and stability in foreign countries, we build both political allies and strong trading partners while reducing the need for potential military intervention. Foreign aid is essential for U.S. interests around the world and to create stable allies that will foster worldwide peace.</p>
<h5 id="bringing-home-amir-hekmati">Bringing home Amir Hekmati:</h5>
<p>I advocated for nearly four years for the release of Marine veteran, Amir Hekmati. Amir is a Flint native who went to Iran to visit his family in 2011 and was falsely arrested and accused of being a spy. While Amir was in prison, I worked tirelessly with former President Obama and Administration officials to draw attention to his imprisonment and fight for his release. As part of these efforts, I introduced a resolution calling on Iran to release Amir and other American political prisoners. The resolution passed the House unanimously.</p>
<p>In January 2016, Amir and three other Americans were released from imprisonment in Iran. One of the proudest days of my life was flying over to Germany with the Hekmati family to bring him home to Flint. I am incredibly grateful to everyone who worked tirelessly with me to secure Amir’s release.</p>
<h2 id="local-issues">LOCAL ISSUES</h2>
<p>I’m proud to be born and raised in Flint. I’m proud to represent such a diverse district in Congress—from the urban cities of Flint, Saginaw and Bay City, to the shoreline communities along Lake Huron like Tawas and Oscoda. During my time in Congress, I have worked on a number of issues that are unique to our district. They include:</p>
<p>Fighting blight: I have helped to secure hundreds of millions in federal funding to help strengthen neighborhoods and tear down vacant buildings. This much-needed money has already helped to remove thousands of vacant and abandoned homes in Flint, Saginaw and other cities across Michigan and will make our communities safer and stronger. This is an issue I’ve long worked on even before coming to Congress – first as the Genesee County Treasurer and then as the President and CEO of the Center for Community Progress.</p>
<p>Keeping Communities Safe: In Congress, I have worked to reduce violent crime in cities like Flint and Saginaw. I introduced the Help Communities Fight Violent Crime Act, which would help the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) conduct “surge” programs that coordinate intelligence and provide additional personnel to combat violent crime. A similar four-month program in Flint in recent years saw a 50 percent drop in the city’s homicide rate during the surge. These successful programs help to keep violent criminals off the streets and help make the streets of Flint, Saginaw and other communities more safe.</p>
<p>Helping Flint’s Recovery: In the wake of the Flint water crisis, I have worked non-stop to make sure Flint families receives the support they need to recover. This includes championing a $170 million federal aid package to help Flint through Congress. This represents real relief for Flint families to help remove lead pipes and expand health care services for those exposed to lead. In addition to this aid, I have successfully passed other legislation through Congress related to the crisis. Last year, I partnered with Congressman Fred Upton (MI-09) to pass the Kildee-Upton law, which strengthens requirements to have the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) immediately notify the public when high concentrations of lead in drinking water are found. This would not have prevented the crisis in Flint, but it will help to ensure that another similar tragedy never happens again. I am proud that this law was passed by Congress and signed into law by former President Obama.</p>
<p>I have also introduced legislation that would require the EPA to update outdated federal drinking water rules governing how we protect our drinking water. It is important to remember that there is no safe level of lead in drinking water. My bill, the NO LEAD Act, would increase transparency when it comes to water testing, require that schools and childcare centers are tested annually for lead, and lower the federal action level for lead in drinking water from the current level of 15 parts per billion (ppb) to 5 ppb by 2026.</p>
<h2 id="jobs-and-the-economy">JOBS AND THE ECONOMY</h2>
<p>America is the richest country in the world, yet we continue to face a widening income gap where millions of Americans are working harder than ever, but they haven’t seen it reflected in their paychecks. Michiganders are working harder than ever, but their incomes are not keeping up with the cost of living, making staying in the middle class more difficult. As income inequality has increased, the rungs on the ladder of opportunity have grown further apart.</p>
<p>Congress can – and should – work together to create opportunity and increase economic opportunity so that all Michiganders and Americans have a chance to succeed. This includes raising the federal minimum wage so millions of workers get a much deserved raise. In Congress, I have co-sponsored H.R. 1010, which would raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10. Raising the federal minimum wage, which is widely supported by the American people, is good for workers, good for businesses and good for our overall economy.</p>
<p>I’m also a strong advocate for the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would provide equal pay for equal work for women. Right now in Michigan, a woman earns less for doing the same exact job and work a man does. That’s wrong. We should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act right away to close this discriminatory wage gap that costs women and their families thousands of dollars in lost wages each year.</p>
<h2 id="health-care">HEALTH CARE</h2>
<p>I have heard from too many families who are worried about the high cost of health care and prescription drugs. Every person in our district and across America deserves access to high quality and affordable health care coverage. In the richest country in the world, Americans shouldn’t be forced to choose between putting a roof over their head, paying for food, or getting the health care and prescription drugs they need.</p>
<p>Below you will find some work I have been working doing in Congress to lower costs, expand access to care and protect Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>Protections for Pre-Existing Conditions: I remain committed to protecting the gains we made through the Affordable Care Act to ensure that those with pre-existing health conditions are not denied access to care. Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions—simply put, we cannot go back. Unfortunately,  President Trump and Republicans in Congress have sought to eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions. I strongly oppose these efforts to take away health care coverage. Additionally, I voted for H.R. 986, the House-passed Protecting Americans with Pre-Existing Conditions Act, to protect families from insurance plans that exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions, and often don’t cover essential health benefits like prescription drug coverage or mental health treatment. These insurance plans are considered ‘junk’ insurance plans because they don’t cover these essential health services.</p>
<p>Lowering Drug Prices: Michiganders are paying too much out-of-pocket for their prescription drugs. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, I have championed legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate with drug companies to lower the cost of drugs for seniors and people with private health insurance. I have also supported legislation that would pave the way for generic prescription drugs to come into the market sooner, which can significantly lower costs for consumers.</p>
<p>Surprise Medical Billing: I have supported efforts to take decisive action to protect patients from the unreasonable and unacceptable practice of surprise medical bills. Surprise billing could arise in an emergency when the patient has no ability to select the emergency room or doctor and they are charged for out-of-network services which can be significantly higher than in-network rate. When a patient has a medical emergency, the last thing they should have to worry about is an unexpected medical bill from an out-of-network provider. If there is a payment dispute between insurance companies and health care providers, patients should not be stuck paying the bill.</p>
<p>Safety Net Programs: Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid are critical programs that provide health care and economic security to seniors, people with disabilities, and the most vulnerable Americans. I was a vocal supporter for Medicaid expansion in Michigan, which has provided hundreds of thousands of people with access to care. I will continue to fight against any efforts to dismantle these programs and remain committed to making sure that they are protected now and for the future.</p>
<h2 id="environment-and-the-great-lakes">ENVIRONMENT AND THE GREAT LAKES</h2>
<p>Michigan is a beautiful state, home to an abundance of natural resources. It’s our responsibility to preserve our water, land and air for future generations. I represent 118 miles of beautiful Lake Huron shoreline and I assure you that protecting our way of life in Michigan is one of my biggest priorities. It’s not just about protecting our environment; our Great Lakes are job creators. The Great Lakes propel our economy, generating billions in annual economic activity each year.</p>
<p>In Congress, I’ve spearheaded efforts to protect our Great Lakes from harm, including from:</p>
<p>Budget cuts: I have always opposed cutting funding for the Great Lakes, both when President Obama proposed a modest cut, and recently when President Trump proposed complete elimination of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). The GLRI, long supported by Republicans and Democrats, helps to protect the Great Lakes from harm, including cleaning up pollution and combatting the threat of invasive species like Asian carp. In eliminating Great Lakes restoration funding, President Trump is threatening our state’s jobs, our livelihood and our way of life.</p>
<p>These are very real threats not only to the Great Lakes, but our economy in Michigan. It is vital that we protect the Great Lakes, now and in the future, because they help to generate billions in annual economic activity and support 1.5 million good-paying jobs in the tourism, boating and fishing industries. Along with a bipartisan group of members, I have urged President Trump to fully fund the GLRI, and I will continue to fight to protect funding for our Great Lakes – our way of life depends on it.</p>
<p>Canadian nuclear waste: The health of our Great Lakes could be in jeopardy if Canada pursues its plans to permanently store nuclear waste in the Great Lakes Basin. For years, the Canadian power company, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), planned to develop a permanent nuclear waste site in Kincardine, Ontario—less than a mile from Lake Huron. I led the fight to successfully stop this nuclear waste facility, and in June 2020 OPG formally abandoned the project. Canada has now proposed another facility that would permanently bury almost 130 million pounds of high-level nuclear waste near the Great Lakes. High-level nuclear waste is the most dangerous form of nuclear waste and remains radioactive for generations.</p>
<p>On September 17, 2021, I introduced, along with Republicans and Democrats from across the Great Lakes region, a bipartisan resolution opposing the construction of a permanent nuclear waste facility in the Great Lakes Basin. I will continue to work in a bipartisan way to bring attention to this threat and seek an alternative location. Surely in the vast land mass that comprises Canada, there is a better place to permanently store nuclear waste than near our Great Lakes.</p>
<p>Aquaculture: For-profit commercial fish farming, commonly referred to as aquaculture, also poses a threat to our lakes, rivers and ponds. If not done correctly, it has been shown to increase pollution, destroy sensitive fish habitats, spread disease and introduce non-native species. That is why I introduced legislation to ban harmful aquaculture practices in both the Great Lakes and federally designated “Wild and Scenic Rivers,” which includes the Au Sable River. Banning aquaculture has support from a vast majority of Michiganders, as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and conservation groups.</p>
<p>Invasive species: Invasive species are a threat to the health of the lakes’ ecosystems, and stopping invasive species, such as Asian carp, from entering the Great Lakes is a top priority. I have worked to make sure programs that fight invasive species are fully funded, fought against harmful aquaculture that can introduce invasive species, and co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to prioritize and enact long-term measures to stop the spread of invasive species.</p>
<p>Nestlé Water Withdrawals: In Michigan, we are blessed to have an abundance of fresh water, and it is our responsibility to ensure that we use these resources sustainably. That’s why I’m concerned about Nestlé, a multi-national corporation, seeking to dramatically increase its withdrawal of groundwater in Michigan. Nestlé is seeking to withdraw up to 400 gallons of Michigan water per minute out of the ground for their bottled water. According to their own analysis, this would extract more water from the ground than can be naturally replenished, harming wildlife habitats and wetlands. I have expressed my opposition to this proposal and will continue to speak out. We must manage our water resources sustainably - it is unfortunate that Nestlé is more concerned with corporate profits than protecting natural resources that support our state’s economy.</p>
<h2 id="education">EDUCATION</h2>
<p>Since I began my career in public service as a member of the Flint Board of Education, I have fought tirelessly for our schools. Our children deserve the best education possible, and our teachers deserve our complete support. Every child, no matter where they grow up, deserves a safe learning environment, highly trained teachers and the resources necessary to succeed in 21st century classrooms. Schools are the foundation of our communities and the future.</p>
<p>Early Education: A child’s education begins very early in life. In order for a child to start on a path to success, we need to invest in universal access to programs like Early Head Start and Head Start. These programs provide kids with essential wrap-around services to help in their development and can also help mitigate the effects of lead exposure in children.</p>
<p>In March 2016, I successfully advocated for a federal grant to expand Head Start and Early Head Start services in Flint. In March 2017, I also announced $5.5 million in federal grants to support new and expanded Early Head Start for children in the Flint area through Early Head Start Child Care Partnership programs.</p>
<p>K-12 Education: Our education system should support teachers, students and parents to ensure a high quality public education for everyone. Access to a quality education is a right that every child in Michigan should be afforded.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Evaluating Students: In 2016, I supported the passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act that will transform education policy to give local school districts more control over how to evaluate their students and teachers, and to support investments in education, including for teacher training, special education and after school programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before, After &amp; Summer School programs: When I was growing up in Flint, our schools were the center of our community, and open from sunrise until sunset with a wide variety of programs to provide kids with constructive activities throughout the day. In Congress, I have been a staunch supporter of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program, which provides funding for before, after and summer school programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting our teachers: Our teachers play a large role in the lives of the children in our communities, and their important work should be celebrated. I will continue to support teachers in providing them with resources inside and outside the classroom as they nurture successful students.</p>
</li>

<p>Higher Education: More than 42 million Americans collectively owe nearly $1.3 trillion in federal student loan debt. This crushing debt is causing young folks to delay buying homes, starting families and saving for retirement. The impacts of this debt will have lifelong impacts on families. I am fighting to ensure that every family has access to a quality, affordable education, including college that provides them with the skills to find a job in our changing economy.</p>
<p>In Congress, I have introduced legislation to address student debt, including legislation to exempt students from having to pay taxes on scholarships and Pell grants, allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy, and prevent banks from calling an entire student loan if the cosigner of that loan dies, even if the student was up to date on their payments.</p>
<p>Finally, I support two years of free community college to every person in Michigan. This will help address the student loan debt and help with the skills gap impacting job growth in Michigan.</p>
