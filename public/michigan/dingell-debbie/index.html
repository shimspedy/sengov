          <p>Congresswoman Debbie Dingell represents Michigan’s 12th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives and serves in House Leadership as a Co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. She is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Natural Resources Committee, where she leads on critical issues including affordable and accessible health care, clean energy and water, domestic manufacturing and supply chain resilience, and protecting out wildlife and natural resources. Growing up in beautiful Michigan, Dingell, who chairs the Great Lakes Task Force, has always been an advocate for the outdoors and commits her work in Congress to protecting the environment for generations. Dingell is focused on bringing people together – in Congress and in her communities – to support Michigan’s families and the economy. This is most evident in her work to strengthen the American auto industry, maintaining America’s competitiveness and ensuring good-paying American jobs. In 2021, she worked together with the White House, the auto industry, the auto workers, and environmentalists to announce the Biden Administration’s goal of having 50% of new vehicles sold in 2030 be zero-emissions vehicles. Dingell also plays a major role in leading the fight against PFAS contamination, spearheading the PFAS Action Act with Republican college Rep. Fred Upton. Her collaborative workstyle also lends itself to bicameral work, most importantly on long-term care, as she authored the Better Care Better Jobs Act with Senator Bob Casey to strengthen and expand access to the long-term care system while also supporting the direct care workforce. As a fierce advocate for reform to our nation’s broken health care system, she is also the co-author of Medicare For All to finally guarantee care for all Americans.</p>
<p>Back home in Michigan, Dingell is known for working closely with state and local officials and community leaders to support hardworking families and address critical issues across Michigan’s 12th District. In 2021, her Honoring Abbas Family Legacy to Terminate (HALT) Drunk Driving Act, a bill she wrote after the Abbas family of Northville was killed by a drunk driver and which would require drunk driving prevention technology to be installed in new cars, was enacted into law. Dingell also worked quickly to secure federal flood relief funding and support to her communities amidst the 2021 summer floods that devastated thousands of Southeast Michigan families and businesses. Additionally, Dingell continued her husband John’s work to open the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge and create a special outdoor space for Michiganders, while also protecting natural resources. As for the veteran community, Dingell meets with VFW posts and visits VA hospitals in the district and even improved the Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning (SAIL) rating in the Ann Arbor VA hospital.</p>
<p>Before being elected to Congress, Dingell – a self-proclaimed car girl – worked in the auto industry for over three decades, where she was President of the General Motors (GM) Foundation and a senior executive responsible for public affairs. She was also Chairman of the Wayne State University (WSU) Board of Governors and to this day continues to fight for affordable and accessible education in Congress. She chaired the Michigan Infant Mortality Task Force, the Children’s Leadership Council of Michigan, the Early Childhood Investment Corporation, the Baby Your Baby public education campaign that reduced infant mortality rates in Michigan, and has served on the board of Michigan’s Children, a statewide independent voice advocating for public policies in the best interest of children of all ages. Beyond those roles, she served as Chairman of the Wayne State University (WSU) Board of Governors and fought for affordable and accessible education in Congress.</p>
<p>An active civic and community leader, Dingell is a recognized national advocate for women and children. She successfully fought to have women included in federally funded health research and advocated for greater awareness of women’s health issues overall, including breast cancer and heart health. She is a founder and former chair of the National Women’s Health Resource Center and the Children&rsquo;s Inn at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>
<p>Debbie is a respected voice in Michigan and has been named multiple times on Crain’s Detroit Business’ 100 Most Influential Women in Michigan list. You’ll always find her out and about in Michigan’s 12th District, likely perusing a farmers market or visiting a union hall – don’t hesitate to come talk to her and tell her what’s on your mind.</p>
<p>Debbie currently resides in Dearborn. She holds both a B.S.F.S. in Foreign Services and an M.S. in Liberal Studies from Georgetown University.</p>
<h2 id="debbie-dingell-is-a-tireless-fighter-for-working-families-in-michigan">Debbie Dingell is a tireless fighter for Working Families in Michigan</h2>
<p>She knows that we can accomplish more by working together on critical issues like protecting our Great Lakes, lowering the costs of healthcare, improving our infrastructure, and creating jobs by supporting manufacturing and leveling the playing field for our workers. A noted leader in improving civility in our public discourse, she strongly believes that we can disagree with one another without being disagreeable.
With values instilled by her Catholic education, Debbie’s activism started at a young age and took root in her passion for issues important to women and children. Prior to being elected to Congress, she successfully fought to have women included in federally-funded health research and advocated for greater awareness of issues directly related to women’s health, including breast cancer and women’s heart health. She is a founder and past chair of the National Women’s Health Resource Center and the Children’s Inn at the National Institutes of Health. A lifelong advocate for young people, Debbie chaired the Michigan Infant Mortality Task Force that reduced infant mortality rates in our state, in addition to serving as Co-Chair of the Children’s Leadership Council, a business-led advocacy group that promotes investment in early childhood education.</p>
<p>Her values are also evident in her professional career before coming to Congress. As an executive at General Motors, she worked to keep our auto industry strong before continuing her dedication to supporting charitable causes as President of the GM Foundation. Demonstrating her commitment to education and students, in 2006 she was elected to the Wayne State Board of Governors where she championed lowering the cost of higher education, and she was Chair of the Board before being elected to Congress.</p>
<p>In Congress, Debbie is a leader on protecting our Great Lakes, improving access to healthcare, lowering prescription drug costs, fighting for seniors and veterans, reducing gun violence and supporting manufacturing. She serves in House Democratic Leadership as Co-Chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and she is also a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, as well as the House Committee on Natural Resources. Debbie is a strong advocate for supporting our auto industry in the United States by protecting manufacturing, and preserving and creating jobs here at home. She has also been an outspoken supporter of strong fuel economy standards that accomplish the twin goals of environmental protection and affordability. Debbie has also worked tirelessly to give our workers a level playing field on trade.</p>
<p>Protecting our environment is a top priority for Debbie. As Co-Chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, she successfully advocated for fully funding the Great Lakes Restoration initiative as well as fighting for more resources to combat PFAS chemical contamination in our state. A strong believer in conservation and preserving our environment, Debbie is championing the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act in Congress, landmark legislation to provide $3.8 billion to states to do proactive work to prevent animals from becoming endangered. The bill is supported by a wide range of environmental and sportsmen groups, including the National Wildlife Federation and the Congressional Sportsmen Foundation. Debbie has also created coalitions to make progress on critical local environmental issues, such as cleaning up the dioxane plume in Washtenaw County and tearing down and cleaning up the old McLouth Steel site Downriver.</p>
<p>Debbie has experienced all sides of the opioid epidemic and her bipartisan legislation to address the issue has been signed into law. She has told her personal story on how she was raised in a household with someone who shouldn’t have had access to a gun and used her passion to fight for legislation to take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. This inspired her to found the Bipartisan Working Group to End Domestic Violence, which has rallied support around the re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act. As Co-Chair of the Medicare for All Caucus, Debbie has also been a leader on the fight for Medicare For All, and her advocacy on the issue led to the first Congressional hearings on her bill.</p>
<p>Her hard work has not gone unnoticed. She was recognized as one of the 25 hardest-working Members of Congress, as well as one of the 100 most influential women in Michigan by Crain’s Magazine and one of the 100 most influential women in Washington, DC by the Washingtonian magazine.</p>
<h2 id="equality">EQUALITY</h2>
<p>Everyone deserves the same rights and protections under the law regardless of who they are or who they love. Discrimination in housing, employment, and other facets of American life is immoral, hurts our nation’s fragile economy, and must be stopped.</p>
<p>As a proud member of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, Debbie served as a co-sponsor of the Equality Act, which passed the House and prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in a wide variety of areas.</p>
<p>Debbie was also a co-sponsor of H. R. 124, which condemned the Trump administration’s unfair ban on transgender service members. Additionally, Debbie was proud to serve as one of the leading advocates to help renew the Violence Against Women Act, which included provisions to help protect transgender people from violence.</p>
<h2 id="education">EDUCATION</h2>
<p>Debbie strongly believes that an investment in education is an investment in our future. At a time when public education is under attack from Betsy Devos and the Trump Administration, she is proud to support our public schools and our teachers and is committed to promoting educational opportunities from Pre-K to higher education and older adults.</p>
<p>In 2019, Debbie helped to secure $4.5 million for Head Start programs in Washtenaw County. This funding will help to ensure that children will receive quality early education regardless of their zip code or socioeconomic status. She has also worked to champion bills that help to promote safety and equality in higher education and voted for the STOP School Violence Act of 2018 to help fund school safety measures across the county.</p>
<p>Debbie has also used her position in Congress to raise awareness about the dangerous changes that the Trump administration has made to title IX protections. She is strenuously opposed to these changes, which weaken the policies needed to help prevent students of all ages from sexual assault.</p>
<h2 id="environment">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p>Throughout her time in Congress, Debbie has worked tirelessly to protect the environment and fight the damaging effects of climate change even in the face of reckless rollbacks of environmental protections by the Trump administration.
As the Co-Chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, Debbie has been one of the biggest advocates for the protection of the Great Lakes. She has opposed the Trump administration’s dangerous rollback of water pollution standards, has introduced legislation to help protect endangered wildlife, and continues the fight to have man-made PFAS chemicals declared as a hazardous substance.</p>
<p>In response to the threat of climate change, Debbie has introduced the 100% Clean Economy Act to initiate a nationwide goal to achieve a 100% clean, net-zero energy economy by 2050 and has co-sponsored legislation to promote investments in research and development of technology to help increase vehicle fuel efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="economy">ECONOMY</h2>
<p>Throughout her time in Congress, Debbie has worked hard to preserve the dignity of work and expand economic opportunities in her district.</p>
<p>As the former chair of the Manufacturing Initiative at the American Automotive Policy Council, Debbie is a strong supporter of the automobile industry. This industry is a major source of jobs in Southeast Michigan and Debbie is committed to helping to protect and expand the automotive industry. She’s also committed to ensuring that emerging companies and entrepreneurs in the region have the opportunities and resources needed to explore innovative business ideas and position themselves for future success.</p>
<p>As a true friend of organized labor, Debbie fights for workers every day. She supports the rights of unions and recognizes the importance of collective bargaining, which is why she cosponsored the PRO Act to protect the basic right for workers to join a union. Debbie was also proud to join UAW workers on the picket line in 2019 as they courageously advocated for what</p>
<h2 id="healthcare">HEALTHCARE</h2>
<p>Debbie believes that if you live in America you have the right to quality healthcare.</p>
<p>As a member of the Subcommittee of Health on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Debbie has been one of the strongest advocates in Congress for expanding health care coverage, lowering the sky-high costs of prescription drugs, and making medical research a national priority.</p>
<p>When you go to the doctor you shouldn’t be worried about how you are going to pay for it. When you have been prescribed life-saving drugs, you shouldn’t have to ration doses just to afford them. That’s why Debbie is a Co-Chair of the Medicare for All Caucus and an original co-sponsor of the Medicare for All Act, is fighting to protect pre-existing condition protections gained through the Affordable Care Act, and is working to pass multiple pieces of legislation with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to lower the costs of prescription drugs.</p>
<h2 id="seniors">SENIORS</h2>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Michiganders rely on Social Security and Medicare. These men and women worked hard for decades and paid their fair share to support these vital programs.</p>
<p>As a member of the Subcommittee of Health on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Aging and Families, Debbie is fighting for policies that allow seniors to retire with dignity, increase access to proper medical and long-term care, and secure the benefits they’ve earned.</p>
<p>Debbie is a lead cosponsor of the Butch Lewis Act, which passed the House in 2019 and ensures multiemployer pension plans remain solvent and continue providing retirees and workers the retirement benefits they have earned. She also introduced the Social Security 2100 Act, a bill that increases Social Security’s vital benefits while making the system financially strong throughout the 21st century.</p>
<h2 id="immigration">IMMIGRATION</h2>
<p>The United States is a land of opportunity. Our history has been written by generations of immigrants who have come to our borders looking for the promise of a better life. They have shaped our culture, our economy, and our national story, helping to make us the greatest of nations — but unfortunately, the Trump administration cannot say the same.</p>
<p>Debbie has been a strong advocate for comprehensive immigration reform in Congress and has stood in strong opposition to Donald Trump’s cruel and inhumane immigration policies. She co-sponsored the Keep Families Together Act and the Family Reunification Act, opposed the detention and possible removal of Iraqi Chaldeans living in the United States, condemned Trump’s zero-tolerance policy that is separating children from their families at the border and continues to fight against travel bans that target Muslim Americans and their families in our district and all across this country.</p>
<h2 id="veterans">VETERANS</h2>
<p>We must ensure that our nation’s veterans receive the services they have earned when they get home — from healthcare, including mental healthcare, to education and training so they can find civilian jobs, to fighting the scourge of homelessness that hits our veteran community so hard. This is our responsibility.</p>
<p>From the beginning of her time in Congress, Debbie has fought for veterans in the district by demanding answers from the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare Supervisor after multiple surgeries on veterans had been canceled due to the Ann Arbor VA. She went on to introduce the VA Transparency Enhancement Act, which would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to report quarterly to Congress on the number of patients who contracted an infection as a result of a surgery and the number of surgeries canceled or transferred by the VA.</p>
<p>Debbie has also cosponsored the Putting Our Veterans Back to Work Act and helped secure $2.2 million in grants to combat veteran homelessness in Southeastern Mic</p>
