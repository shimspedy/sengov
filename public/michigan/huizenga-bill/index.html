          <p>Congressman Bill Huizenga represents Michigan&rsquo;s 2nd Congressional District which stretches from Kentwood to the lakeshore and up the coast of Lake Michigan from Holland to Ludington. Huizenga was first elected to Congress in 2010 and is currently serving in his sixth term.</p>
<p>As a member of the prestigious House Financial Services Committee, Huizenga has focused on removing government-imposed barriers to private sector job creation and increasing transparency across the federal government. Because of his steadfast leadership, Congressman Huizenga has been selected to serve as Ranking Member on the Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee for the 117th Congress.</p>
<p>Congressman Huizenga has focused oversight efforts pertaining to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) operations, activities, and initiatives to ensure that it fulfills its congressional mandate to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. This subcommittee also has jurisdiction pertaining to credit rating agencies, investment advisers, mutual funds, accounting standards, equity/option market structure, and fixed-income market structure.  Bill is also serving on the Housing, Community Development, and Insurance Subcommittee in the 117th Congress.  Previously, Bill served as a member of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee where he focused on restoring accountability and transparency to the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Since January of 2017, Congressman Huizenga has been elected by his colleagues to serve as a Co-Chair of the Great Lakes Task Force. This bipartisan group fosters cooperation and support for policies and programs that enhance the environmental health of the Great Lakes while also ensuring the full economic potential of the Great Lakes region is realized. As a bipartisan leader on the Great Lakes, Huizenga has successfully rallied bipartisan support for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), a program that is vital to preserving and protecting the Great Lakes ecology while also promoting opportunities for the Great Lakes economy.  The GLRI has had multiple success stories across West Michigan and throughout the Great Lakes basin.</p>
<p>Congressman Huizenga is also a founding member of the bipartisan PFAS Task Force. From during the 116th Congress, the goals of the Task Force include: educating members of Congress and the public about the potential impacts of PFAS; help craft bipartisan legislation to help communities recover from PFAS contamination, and working to determine the proper health and safety levels of PFAS. Bill believes residents in West Michigan across the nation deserve to know the truth and the full picture about the health risks as well as the sources associated with PFAS and PFOAS.</p>
<p>Huizenga&rsquo;s interest in public service began when he was a young boy. When the family was gathered around the dinner table, his father would encourage thoughtful discussions surrounding business and politics. Huizenga went on to attend Holland Christian High School, and later received his bachelor’s degree in Political Science from Calvin College. After college, Bill began his career as a Realtor and entrepreneur. Today, Bill co-owns Huizenga Gravel Inc. located in Jenison, MI.</p>
<p>Bill became deeply familiar with the issues facing West Michigan residents while serving as the Director of Public Policy for Congressman Pete Hoekstra. That experience combined with Bill&rsquo;s first-hand knowledge of the regulatory and tax burdens facing small businesses and the desire to create a better environment for his children inspired Bill to return to public service.</p>
<p>In 2002, Huizenga was elected to represent the southern portion of Ottawa County, Michigan’s 90th District, in the Michigan House of Representatives. There, he served in elected leadership roles as well as Chairman of the Commerce Committee. He was re-elected until term-limited out in 2008.</p>
<p>Congressman Huizenga is a lifelong resident of Ottawa County, where he currently resides with his wife and children.</p>
<h2 id="the-economy">The Economy</h2>
<p>As a small business owner, I understand what American job creators need: less interference and lower taxes. That is why my number one priority in Congress is to promote an atmosphere for job creation, economic growth, and higher wages for families across Michigan.</p>
<h2 id="a-balanced-budget">A Balanced Budget</h2>
<p>We must enact a Balanced Budget Amendment. A Balanced Budget Amendment would prevent the federal government from spending outside its means. Families across West Michigan have to sit down and balance their budget. The State of Michigan has to pass a balanced budget every year; it’s commonsense that Washington should have to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="sanctity-of-life">sanctity of life</h2>
<p>The sanctity of life is close to my heart and dear to my family. Protecting life beginning with conception is a value that cannot be compromised and something that I will continue to fight for. I stressed this for 10 years as the Right to Life representative for my church in Zeeland and continue to fight for the unborn as a member of Congress.</p>
<h2 id="agriculture">Agriculture</h2>
<p>Agriculture is one of the strongest economic drivers in Michigan. In fact, the impact of food and agriculture on Michigan’s economy is estimated at $101.2 billion and accounts for nearly 1 in 4 jobs. The Fourth District is one of the most agriculturally diverse in Michigan and is a leader in livestock, poultry, pork, fruit, nursery, greenhouse, and floriculture production. I have consistently fought for the hard-working farmers in the Fourth District and will continue to support Michigan’s farmers and growers.</p>
<h2 id="veteran">veteran</h2>
<p>As the son of a disabled World War II veteran, ensuring that our veterans are treated with the dignity and respect they have earned is very personal to me. It’s clear the federal government has failed our veterans. I will hold the VA accountable and fight for drastic reforms so the men and women who have served our nation are put first.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-lakes">The Great Lakes</h2>
<p>Michigan residents have long understood the importance of the Great Lakes, but if you get outside of the region, some folks don’t quite grasp how these picturesque settings, beautiful beaches, and pristine sunsets, play a vital role in our economy.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>As the father of five children, I believe that parents know their kids the best. For too long, officials at the federal, state, and local levels have moved to shut parents out of their education while directing what our children learn through top-down mandates. I believe that decisions about our children’s education should be made by those who truly know them best, and parents should be empowered to ask questions and work with school officials to achieve the best outcomes for their children.</p>
<h2 id="defending-our-constitution">Defending our Constitution</h2>
<p>Defending our Constitution is the foremost responsibility of any Member of Congress. As the size of government grows, the American people are rightly concerned about its interference in our lives. Congress must act as a check and balance to protect the freedoms and liberties that we hold dear.</p>
<h2 id="combating-poverty">Combating Poverty</h2>
<p>From a young age, my parents taught me to be kind, generous, and to value service. Michigan shares these values and is blessed with numerous churches and charitable organizations that serve the most vulnerable in our communities. The federal government can do better a job of helping people escape the poverty trap and it must. It is time to stop measuring the success of anti-poverty programs by how much money is spent but instead by how many people are helped.</p>
<h2 id="real-healthcare-reform">Real Healthcare Reform</h2>
<p>When Obamacare was signed into law, Americans were promised that their costs would go down, that care would improve, and that more choices would be available. Today, we know these claims to be fiction and that ObamaCare has failed. In reality, costs have skyrocketed, the quality of care has been driven down, and hardworking Michiganders have had to change doctors because ObamaCare did not cover the doctor their family had seen for years.</p>
<h2 id="energy-independence">Energy Independence</h2>
<p>Our nation is in the midst of an energy boom. Affordable, reliable energy has never been more accessible. This keeps costs down, creates jobs, and protects us from relying on foreign nations to meet our energy needs. At the same time, we must strike a balance between economic growth and protecting our environment. That is why I support a responsible all of the above approaches to increasing American energy supplies that ensure Michigan’s energy demands are met.</p>
<h2 id="keep-america-safe">keep America safe</h2>
<p>It is my most solemn duty to support and supply our military and intelligence officials with all the tools that they need to achieve success in keeping the United States secure. As new threats emerge, our armed forces must have the tools they need to respond. A strong Military and Homeland is needed due to the re-emergence of competitors like Russia and China, the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran, the imperative to keep the pressure on terrorist organizations.</p>
