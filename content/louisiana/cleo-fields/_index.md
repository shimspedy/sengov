Cleo Fields is an elected member of the United States House of Representatives, serving Louisiana’s 6th Congressional District. With over three decades of public service, Fields has dedicated his career to improving the lives of Louisianans through leadership, vision, and action.

Cleo currently is working to address the needs of his constituents and advance the priorities of Louisiana.

A graduate of McKinley High School and Southern University, Fields earned his Juris Doctorate from Southern University Law Center in 1987. At just 24, he made history as the youngest person ever elected to the Louisiana State Senate. In 1992, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the youngest member of the 103rd Congress.

Cleo has been a tireless advocate for education, economic development, and community empowerment. He authored impactful legislation such as the Delta Initiatives Act and founded the Congressional Classroom—now the Louisiana Leadership Institute—to inspire and develop the next generation of leaders.

After a historic run for governor for Louisiana in 1995, Fields returned home to develop his law practice, The Fields Law Firm. However, Cleo’s passion for service wasn’t extinguished, as he was re-elected to the State Senate in 1997-2012 and again in 2019. His time in the senate has allowed him to serve as Chair of the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus, Chairman of Education, Local and Municipal Affairs and Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee.

Cleo is married to his wife, Debra, and they have two adult sons, Brandon and Christopher. A long-time member of Mt. Pilgrim Baptist Church, he remains deeply committed to serving his community and improving opportunities for all Louisianans.
