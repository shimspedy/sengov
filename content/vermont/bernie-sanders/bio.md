#### Senator Bernie Sanders Criticisms
Sanders received some backlash at the time when the Paris attack coincided with the Democratic Presidential debate. Each candidate was provided one minute to share their statements on this tragedy. Sanders fails to show sympathy by turning the debate into an economical address.

I felt sorry for him because Bernie Sanders was just not good at playing politics – showing the right feelings at the right time to the right people. 
Most American voters will agree they want a president that is honest. But, when things seem different when the candidate is Sanders. He is known for not taking superPAC money and having unbendable values. 

People criticized him for being unpalatable as a President and too idealistic about his policy platforms.  

Middle-ground voters also considered Sanders’ policies to be too far left – making him largely unelectable. Attacks on him being too liberal to win the Democratic Primary are common places.

He is also known or more like hated, for his memorable 8.5 hour-long filibusters.
