### About gov Bill Lee 
Bill Lee is a seventh-generation Tennessean and the 50th Governor of Tennessee. He was raised in Franklin, where he still resides today with his wife, Maria, on his family’s farm. He’s the proud father of four adult children (Jessica, twin sons Jacob and Caleb, and Sarah Kate) and eight grandchildren.

After attending Williamson County Schools, Governor Lee attended Auburn University, where he studied Mechanical Engineering. After graduation, he returned home to Franklin to join the family business his grandfather started in 1944, a comprehensive mechanical construction service company. He became president of Lee Company in 1992.

Since becoming Governor in 2019, Governor Lee has focused on several priorities including quality education, economic development, public safety, and supporting families, all with a particular focus on the accelerated transformation of rural Tennessee.

### leadership
Under his leadership, Tennessee has strengthened career and technical training, expanded school choice, passed the most pro-life legislation in the country, achieved meaningful criminal justice reform, cut taxes, and sharpened the effectiveness of government.

Additionally, Tennessee was named the number one best fiscally managed state in the country, the best business climate in the U.S., number one in the nation for advanced industry job growth, and the best state for small business growth. Tennesseans also enjoy the lowest state and local tax burden per capita in the country. Since Governor Lee took office, the state has garnered 272 project commitments to create almost 40,000 jobs and $12.9 billion in capital investments, with Ford Motor Company and SK Innovation, Amazon, Oracle, FedEx-Logistics, General Motors, Mitsubishi, and dozens of other companies choosing to invest in Tennessee’s business-friendly environment.

The governor and first lady are people of strong faith. They are active in numerous faith-based ministries, which have taken them all over the world to serve people in need, including to Africa, Haiti, Central America, and the Middle East.
