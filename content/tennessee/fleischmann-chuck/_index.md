Chuck Fleischmann is a fiscal and social conservative who is the Congressman from Tennessee's 3rd Congressional District. Since being elected, Congressman Fleischmann has voted to cut $1.6 trillion from the federal budget, repeal ObamaCare, defund Planned Parenthood, rein in the EPA, and has a 100% pro-life and 2nd Amendment voting record. He is a proven conservative. Chuck serves on the House Committee on Appropriations and a number of subcommittees that are vitally important to the residents of the 3rd District.

From a young boy overcoming the loss of his mother, to living on his own at 16, to mopping the floor of a McDonald's, to working in a library, to starting a business with his wife and finally becoming a member of Congress, Chuck Fleischmann has lived the American dream. He ran for office so he could try to bring that American dream that he's been privileged to be a part of, to you, to your family, and to your grandchildren.

#### Growing Our Economy
Chuck owned a small business in the Tennessee Valley for years. He knows firsthand that the government does not create jobs; small businesses create jobs. That’s why he’s committed to getting government out of the way so that our Tennessee business can continue to grow. Chuck will continue to fight for policies that promote business investment, lower taxes, and reduce the regulatory burdens on businesses to create the strong economic force.


#### Reducing Our National Debt
The federal government should be prohibited from spending more money than it collects each year, and a constitutional amendment is needed in order to force Congress to live within its means. Our country is drowning in a sea of debt with uncontrolled government spending and a tax system that fails to support the continued growth that our nation’s economy needs. Clear and concise legislation is needed in order to hold the federal government accountable for the abuse, fraud and waste that they expect the American taxpayer to subsidize.


#### Cutting Taxes
In 2017, Chuck led the fight alongside President Donald Trump to implement the first historic tax reform in decades. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act simplified our tax code, making it more fair. While this was significant progress, our current tax code remains too complex. We must continue to overhaul the tax code so that American taxpayers keep more of their own money instead of having the federal government spend it for them. Modernizing our tax code will also make America more competitive in the global economy. Chuck believes that taxation is an invasion of privacy, and he’ll keep fighting to lower taxes.


#### Stopping Illegal Immigration
America’s current immigration policies are not working. Change is needed. Our country’s border security is paramount to our nation’s security. Chuck strongly opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants, and he believes immigration reform begins with building the wall on our southern border. He's visited the border, where he met with Border Patrol Officers and saw first hand the challenges they face. This only increased his resolve to build the wall. He’ll continue to work to keep illegal immigrants out of Tennessee and out of this country.


#### Protecting Our Conservative Values
When our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they enshrined some of our God-given rights into law. Too often, those rights are under attack. Chuck will always fight to preserve our conservative values to ensure that the America we know and love remains for generations to come.


#### Defending The Right To Life
All human life has value and is sacred, and Chuck believes that life begins at conception. He strongly opposes using taxpayer money to fund abortions, and Planned Parenthood. He is deeply troubled by the radical Left’s promotion of abortion, and even infanticide. Chuck will always stand up for our most vulnerable.


#### Protecting The 2nd Amendment
The words of the Second Amendment are clear and direct: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Yet the Second Amendment continues to be one of the most hotly debated Amendments in American history. Gun control proponents across the country are trying to limit and take away the rights of individuals to possess firearms. Such actions are both unconstitutional and a threat to our liberty. Chuck strongly opposes any legislation that threatens the Second Amendment rights of Tennesseans and Americans. He knows that violence in our culture is a problem, and he’s committed to reforming our mental health system.


#### Ensuring Health Care Puts Patients First
The health care system in our country is broken. Too many Americans are currently living without health insurance, which has become too expensive because of rising health care costs. It has become a terrible cycle. A government run health insurance program is not the answer. It would take control away from the doctors. It would threaten employer sponsored health insurance. But, most importantly, it would limit individual choices. Government run health insurance does not work. It doesn’t work in the countries that have it. It won’t work in America. Chuck will continue to fight for a health care system lower costs and provides patients with the care that they need, want and deserve.

#### Educating The Next Generation
Education is the key to Tennessee's future. We need an education system that provides our students with the skills they need to compete and succeed in life. Every child should have access to a quality education that teaches the fundamental skills needed to compete in a global economy. Without an educated workforce, Tennessee cannot compete nationally, and America can't compete in a global economy. Washington can’t just throw money at our schools. We must place emphasis on the individual students, not on federal educational mandates from bureaucrats. The federal government needs to get out of the classroom and let our good teachers do what they do best.

#### Keeping Our Communities Safe
Chuck deeply appreciates our law enforcement officers and their families, and he will always work to ensure they have the tools they need to keep our communities safe. He regularly meets with law enforcement to learn how the federal government can better work with them. He is committed to working with law enforcement and our medical providers to stop the opioid epidemic plaguing our communities. Putting an end to this public health crisis will require action from every level of government, and Chuck will do everything he can to stop this crisis.

#### Protecting Our National Security
After years of President Obama’s failed “lead from behind” strategy, America finally has a President who understands America is a leader on the world stage. We must continue to work closely with our longstanding allies, especially Israel, and we must always remember our enemies seek to do us harm. Chuck will do everything he can to ensure our brave men and women in uniform have the tools they need to defend freedom.

#### Serving Our Veterans
Our brave men and women in uniform make tremendous sacrifices every day to keep us safe, and we must provide all the support we can to our active duty military. This fundamental responsibility to our troops does not end with their service. We are deeply indebted to the men and women who answer the call to service, and we must ensure they have the care they have earned. This issue is personal for Chuck. He watched as his father struggled with the Veterans Affairs too often failed those it was meant to serve. He is committed to ensuring our veterans have access to the highest quality care.

#### Implementing An All-Of-The-Above Approach To Energy
When it comes to energy policy, Chuck supports an all-of-the-above approach. It is imperative to our national security that the United States becomes energy independent. He also believes that nuclear power constitutes a safe, effective, and environmentally friendly way to produce energy for our country. Greater reliance on nuclear power will result in a reduction of importing oil from nations friendly to terrorists. Nuclear power creates jobs and strengthens our national security and economic stability - right here at Oak Ridge in Anderson County. Americans want reliable and affordable energy sources that allow our economy to grow, and Chuck will continue to work with President Trump to find common sense solutions to our current and future energy needs.
