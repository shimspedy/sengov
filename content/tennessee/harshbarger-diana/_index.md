Diana Harshbarger was born in Kingsport, TN and grew up in the small neighboring town of Bloomingdale.

Diana’s parents taught her that with hard work and an unrelenting spirit, anything is possible. Though they did not have the opportunity to graduate from high school, her parents’ perseverance allowed them to work and raise a family.

Diana was the first one in her family to graduate from college. She did her undergraduate studies at East Tennessee State University (E.T.S.U.), and graduated from Mercer University College of Pharmacy with a Doctor of Pharmacy degree.

Diana returned to Kingsport after graduating pharmacy school. She has been a licensed pharmacist since 1987 and a successful business owner for over thirty years. Diana is a problem solver. She has made a career of not only finding solutions for patients’ problems, but providing them comfort in some of their most trying times.

Diana has been an active member of her Kingsport community, teaching Sunday school, helping with her church’s mission work and other local non-profits. She is a leader in her field and in business, a member of the local Chamber of Commerce and a former board member of the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists.

Diana is an unapologetic conservative Trump Republican. She is running for Congress because she believes that our nation is at a tipping point. Fringe liberals threaten the future of our country with the false promises of socialism. They stand in the way of President Donald Trump’s progress and economic freedom. The president needs an outsider like himself in Congress that has his back. The president needs someone that is not beholden to political games or special interests, someone who understands what it takes to build a business and raise a family. The president needs Diana Harshbarger.

Career politicians – from both parties – have failed the American people and East Tennessee for years. They have had years to solve the problems that plague every day families and have had decades to change politics as usual. Enough is enough. When America’s future, and the futures of her son, her grandsons, and so many others in East Tennessee are on the line, it is time to get Tennessee Tough. It is time for a dose of the right medicine.

#### Immigration
Our immigration system is broken. Between the drugs and criminals that flow across our southern border, politicians dubbing their cities and states “sanctuaries” for illegals, and law barring local law enforcement from coordinating with federal agencies to remove dangerous criminal aliens from our streets, illegal immigration has become one of the most pressing issues of our time. 

I will work with President Trump to build the wall on our southern border, deport dangerous illegal aliens from our country, and take action against sanctuary policies that place the security of our nation and citizens in jeopardy. I will also work to pass legislation that bars illegal immigrants from getting free college and healthcare on the backs of hardworking tax payers and fight back against attempts to give amnesty to those who broke the law to come here.

#### 2nd Amendment
The Constitution could not be clearer on this issue, the right to bear arms shall not be infringed. Each day we see the radical left trying to expand the role of government, while the Second Amendment was created to prevent just that. Our right to self-defense, whether it be from a home invader, an attacker on the street, or a tyrannical government, is one of our most sacred rights. I will fight tirelessly to ensure our right to bear arms is protected. 

#### Term Limits
Term limits are critical to preserving the integrity of our political institutions. Career politicians are in this for one thing, themselves. Too often we see the self-serving side of our elected officials who choose to stay in office long past their effectiveness. I will work to pass legislation that places term limits on all federal offices to stop career politicians from profiting off their positions and placing their personal interests ahead of the people they represent. 

#### Opioid Crisis
The opioid crisis has taken our nation and Northeast Tennessee by storm in recent years, and the pain felt from losing a loved one to this disease is becoming all too common. Solving this problem requires a three-pronged approach: cracking down on the illegal drugs, specifically heroin and fentanyl, coming across our borders; increasing funding for rehabilitation resources so those seeking help face fewer hurdles when receiving assistance; and holding those responsible for creating this crisis accountable. 

#### National Security
The federal government’s number one priority is protecting its citizens. I will always fight to make sure our men and women in uniform have the tools and training necessary to protect our country from any threat. Under President Trump, the United States has defeated ISIS and reestablished our leadership on the world stage. Whether its radical Islamic terror, Chinese aggression in South East Asia or Russia’s attempts to undermine our foreign Policy in the Middle East, it is of the utmost importance to continue on this trajectory and maintain our Peace through Strength policy. 

#### Education
I was the first person in my family to go to college, so I understand first-hand the doors education can open for one’s life. Education is the key to financial stability and success, but that does not mean you need a higher education degree. I believe our country needs to invest in trade and technical skills schools in Northeast Tennessee. People need choices for their education, not thousands of dollars in debt. In order to boost Northeast Tennessee’s economy and jobs, there needs to be a focus on opening education options and opportunities. Families, teachers, and our communities need to be empowered while big government needs to get out of the classroom.

#### America First
As our country reels from the effects of the COVID-19 virus, it cannot be overlooked that China was, in fact, to blame for the worldwide pandemic. Had they shared information and been truthful about the situation – something they still have not done – thousands of lives could be saved. China plays an integral part in the world’s pharmaceutical supply chain, particularly for generic drugs, and as a result Americans are at risk of massive drug shortages due to the COVID-19 virus.  As a practicing Pharmacist, I know first-hand the negative impact a drug shortage can have on our communities and special patient populations. Relying on foreign powers like China for pharmaceuticals is detrimental to Americans’ well-being and rewards bad actors. 

China must be held responsible, not in a meaningless motion passed by members of Congress, but with economic realities. I would support a bill to punish China for what they have cost Americans and citizens worldwide because of their negligence. Additionally, I would support more sanctions on the Chinese government. I stand with President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda.

#### Pro Life
Driven by my faith, I am 100% pro-life. Democrats no longer just advocate for abortion, they push extreme policies like killing a baby up until the moment of birth and, in some cases, after. I vow to stand firm in my faith and defend life against radical liberals.

#### Health Care
As a practicing Pharmacist, I could go on for days about the horrible effects Obamacare has had on the healthcare industry, as well as everyday Americans. Health insurance companies and government bureaucrats are out of control. Authority of healthcare choices should be given back to patients and healthcare providers. 

While there is much work to be done to eliminate the overreaching arm of the federal government when it comes to healthcare, the first steps I will take in Congress will be to lower prescription drug prices, increase generic drug pricing transparency as well as increase competition among health insurance plans. These reforms will make it easier for Americans, especially our seniors, to afford their medications.

#### Jobs & the Economy
I’ve owned many small businesses over my career, and I can tell the pro-business environment created by President Donald Trump was like nothing we ever saw before. I will continue to help President Trump advance his “America First” Agenda and once we get through fighting the COVID-19 virus, we will get back to fighting back against burdensome regulations, helping secure fairer trade deals for American citizens and making President Trump’s tax cuts permanent. 

#### Religious Freedom
As a Sunday School teacher for nearly 25 years, I vow to protect our freedom of religion at all costs. Religious freedom was such a critical issue to our founding fathers that the First Amendment made to our constitution was to protect one’s right to choose the God they pray to, while simultaneously making it illegal for the government to have a say in who you worship. 

For years, we have seen the federal government attempt to limit our religious freedoms. Whether it’s demagoguing one religion over the other or being critical of prayer in certain settings, I will not cave to the political zealots that seek to tear down our religious institutions in favor of government. 

#### Supporting Our Veterans
Veterans are some of the finest among us and they deserve the very best we have to offer in return for their sacrifices and commitment to protecting America, her freedoms and citizens. President Trump has done great work in improving our VA healthcare system. We need to continue to build on this progress and make sure every veteran has access to both the physical and mental healthcare they rightfully deserve.
