     greeting: contact Governor Gina Raimondo 
     description: Gina M. Raimondo, the 75th Governor of Rhode Island and its first woman governor, grew up in Smithfield in a tight-knit Italian-American family, the youngest of Joseph and Josephine Raimondoâ€™s three children. Gov. Raimondo went on to graduate with honors from Harvard, where she was recognized as the top economics student in her class. She won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University where she earned a doctorate and met her future husband Andy Moffit. She later graduated from Yale Law School. Gov. Raimondo clerked for U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood and served as founding employee and senior vice president at Village Ventures. Missing Rhode Island and wanting to be closer to her family, Gov. Raimondo co-founded Point Judith Capital, an early stage venture capital firm. In November 2010, Gov. Raimondo was elected to serve as General Treasurer of Rhode Island, receiving the largest number of votes of any statewide candidate. Governor Raimondo resigned her position to be the United States Secretary of Commerce.
