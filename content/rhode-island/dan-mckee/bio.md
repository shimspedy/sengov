#### Know more about Dan McKee 
Daniel J. McKee was sworn in as the 76th Governor of Rhode Island on March 2, 2021. As lieutenant governor from 2015 to 2021, Dan focused on creating more economic opportunity for all Rhode Island families and building solvent communities.

As a small businessman and elected official, he has spent his adult life advocating for positive change in Rhode Island. His record is one of strong fiscal management, visionary education initiatives and thoughtful economic development.

His tenure at the State House had been marked by the same leadership approach. He used the lieutenant governor’s office to support small businesses, improve the state’s economic situation and be a champion of Rhode Island’s cities and towns, which have been underrepresented.

He served as Chair of the National Lieutenant Governors Association, co-chair of the NLGA’s Energy Committee and a member of its Education Committee.

Dan is a lifelong Rhode Islander who graduated from Cumberland High School. He holds a bachelor’s degree in political science and education from Assumption College in Massachusetts and a master’s degree in public administration from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. He has owned and operated successful small businesses in the Blackstone Valley for three decades. Dan has been a member of the board of directors of the Boys and Girls Club of Cumberland-Lincoln for 25 years and served as a youth basketball coach.
Dan and his wife Susan have two grown children, Matt and Kara.
