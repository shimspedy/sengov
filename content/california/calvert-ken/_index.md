Since he was first elected to Congress, Rep.

Rep. Calvert has authored a number of bills that became law including legislation that protects against identity theft by prohibiting the appearance of Social Security account numbers on or through unopened mailings of checks issued by the Treasury Department, provides additional educational dollars to states through a simplified collection process of oil and gas royalties, increasing the penalties for desecrating our national cemeteries, establishing the Medal of Honor Memorial at the Riverside National Cemetery as a "national" memorial, and reduces or eliminates the use of animals to test product and chemical safety by establishing alternative test methods throughout a coalition of federal agencies; and established the Distinguished Flying Cross Memorial as a National Memorial.

In 1996, Calvert authored legislation that created E-Verify, the only tool available to employers to check the veracity of a name and Social Security number given on an I-9 form for employment. That law is a result of Calvert’s 1995 tour of the southern border at which a Border Patrol agent remarked on the job magnet that brings hundreds of thousands of people illegally to the United States. Rep. Calvert, a former small business owner and employer, concluded that the best and quickest way to enable employers to check the legal status of newly hired employees was to set up a system that could check the name against the Social Security number.

Rep. Calvert’s legislative work has received top ratings from the Americans for Tax Reform, Christian Coalition, League of Private Property Voters, National Federation of Independent Businesses, 60 Plus Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Small Business Survival Committee and Citizens for a Sound Economy.

In the 116th Congress, Rep. Calvert's legislative priorities includes: enacting pro-growth policies that will help strengthen our economy for American families; supporting the men and women serving in our military around the world; fixing our broken immigration system by restoring the rule of law and making the use of E-Verify mandatory for all employers in the U.S.; honoring promises to our veterans; advocating for NIH research for cures for our most deadly diseases; creating long-term solutions to California's water challenges; reducing the time it takes to build infrastructure projects by making common sense, bi-partisan reforms to our environmental laws; funding the development of the life-saving Earthquake Early Warning System; and, much more.
