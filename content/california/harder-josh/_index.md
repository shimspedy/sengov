Josh Harder is in Congress to fight for the Central Valley. Josh proudly represents California's 10th Congressional District, located in California's Central Valley covering Stanislaus County and parts of San Joaquin County.

Josh's family has been in the Central Valley for generations, since his great-great grandfather joined a wagon train in search of gold and stopped just short to start a peach farm in Manteca. He's witnessed how the community is consistently left behind. He came to Congress to advocate for lower health care costs, good paying jobs, and innovative solutions to bring more water to families and farmers.

As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, Josh focuses on ensuring the Central Valley's vibrant agricultural community thrives. The Central Valley grows a third of the United States' food supply, half the fruit and nuts in the nation, and hosts some of the most productive farming in the world. That is why Josh prioritizes not only serving our farmers and producers, but also is dedicated to finding solutions to better manage our water resources and help our communities better prepare for droughts. In fact, his SAVE Water Resources Act will make a meaningful investment and add nearly 2 million acre-feet of water storage to grow and secure the Central Valley's water supply.

Josh also serves as a member of the Appropriations Committee. He is the first Democratic member of Congress from the Central Valley to serve on the committee in almost 50 years and will use his role to advocate for more federal support for water infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture, and other Central Valley priorities.

Josh started his career in the private sector where he focused on creating jobs and growing businesses. This took him to Kenya and Uganda where he helped small farmers access funding. After receiving a public policy and business degree from Harvard, he taught business at Modesto Junior College before entering public service.

Josh lives in the Central Valley with his wife Pam and a rotating cast of foster dogs â€“ let him know if you are looking to adopt!
