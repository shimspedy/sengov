Dianne Goldman Berman Feinstein (/ˈfaɪnstaɪn/; born Dianne Emiel Goldman; June 22, 1933 – September 29, 2023) was a prominent American political figure who held the position of United States Senator from California from 1992 until her passing in 2023. She was a stalwart member of the Democratic Party and previously served as the Mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988.

A native of San Francisco, Feinstein graduated from Stanford University in 1955. Her political journey commenced with her election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969, where she swiftly assumed the role of the board's first female president in 1970. Notably, in 1978, while serving as president of the board for the third time, Feinstein found herself in the spotlight following the tragic assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk. She stepped into the role of mayor, marking the first time a woman had held the position in San Francisco's history. During her tenure, she spearheaded the revitalization of the city's iconic cable car system and managed the 1984 Democratic National Convention. Despite a recall attempt in 1983, Feinstein remained a beloved mayor and was acclaimed as the most effective mayor in the nation by City & State in 1987.

Following an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 1990, Feinstein secured election to the U.S. Senate in a special election in 1992. In November of that year, she became California's first female U.S. senator, and shortly thereafter, she ascended to the position of the state's senior senator when Alan Cranston retired in January 1993. Feinstein's popularity was evident through her reelection five times, with her receiving a record 7.86 million votes in the 2012 election, the highest number ever garnered by a U.S. Senate candidate.

Feinstein's legislative accomplishments included authoring the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban and breaking gender barriers as the first woman to chair both the Senate Rules Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee. She also made history as the first woman to preside over a U.S. presidential inauguration. Feinstein chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee from 2009 to 2015 and served as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 2017 to 2021.

During her later years in office, concerns about her mental fitness to serve arose as her health declined with age. In February 2023, Feinstein announced her decision not to seek reelection in 2024. Sadly, she passed away in office on September 29, 2023, at the age of 90. At the time of her passing, Feinstein held several distinctions, including being the oldest sitting U.S. senator and member of Congress. She also held the record as the longest-serving U.S. senator from California and the longest-serving female senator in U.S. history.

Among Senator Feinstein’s many legislative accomplishments:
