A wife, mother, public servant, and lifelong San Joaquin Valley resident, Rep. Conway has served as a businesswoman, healthcare worker, Tulare County Supervisor, President of the California State Association of Counties, Director of the National Association of Counties, and a Republican legislator. In 2019 President Trump appointed her to serve as the California Executive Director of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency. In that position, Rep. Conway helped distribute critical funding to sustain farms and agricultural operations during the trade war with China and global shutdowns. She also led the nation's largest Farm Service Agency by administering more than $100 million in safety net and disaster relief programs serving California farmers, ranchers, foresters, and agricultural producers. 

Prior to that appointment, Rep. Conway had served as Republican Leader in the California Assembly, where she advocated for a conservative governing agenda including lower taxes, increasing water supplies for the San Joaquin Valley, and good governance measures such as establishing a Rainy Day fund to stabilize the state’s finances during future financial crises.   

Rep. Conway has also operated her own consulting business and served in numerous other private-sector positions spanning business management, education, and marketing. Having a particular passion for wellness, she has extensive experience in the healthcare sector, working for healthcare institutions including the Women’s Health Department at Tulare District Hospital and coordinating a wellness program for Visalia’s Kaweah Health Medical Center.
