Early Beginnings

Congresswoman Simon’s career began in her late teens when joined the Young Women’s Freedom Center and worked with women and girls cycling through the criminal justice and foster care systems.

This work laid the foundation for decades of advocacy to empower women and young people.

Later, the Congresswoman’s leadership expanded into criminal justice reform when she partnered with then-San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris to head the Back on Track program. This nationally recognized initiative offered first-time, nonviolent offenders alternatives to incarceration, reducing recidivism, and providing a second chance for participants.

In these roles, she managed multi-million-dollar initiatives to empower youth, hold systems accountable, and support community leadership development.

She launched BART’s Ambassador Program, a nationally recognized model for public safety that integrates unarmed ambassadors and crisis intervention specialists to improve transit riders' safety and accessibility.

Additionally, Congresswoman Simon has served on numerous community boards, including the San Francisco Foundation, Rosenberg Foundation, Akonadi Foundation, Women’s Foundation of California, Alliance for Girls Advisory Committee, and At The Crossroads.
