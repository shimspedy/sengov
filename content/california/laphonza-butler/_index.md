Laphonza Romanique Butler is an American politician currently serving as the junior United States senator from California since 2023. Her career took root as a union organizer, and she held the position of president of the California SEIU State Council from 2013 to 2018. A dedicated member of the Democratic Party, Butler assumed the role of president at EMILY's List from 2021 to 2023 and also served as a regent of the University of California from 2018 to 2021.

On October 1, 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom selected Butler to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the passing of Laphonza R. Butler.

#### Early Life and Education

Butler was born on May 11, 1979, in Magnolia, Mississippi, as the youngest of three siblings. Tragically, her father succumbed to heart disease when she was just 16 years old. In 1997, she graduated as the salutatorian of South Pike High School. Butler went on to attain a bachelor's degree in political science from Jackson State University.

#### Career

Butler embarked on her career as a union organizer, advocating for nurses in Baltimore and Milwaukee, janitors in Philadelphia, and hospital workers in New Haven, Connecticut. In 2009, she relocated to California, where she organized in-home caregivers and nurses, ultimately becoming the president of SEIU United Long Term Care Workers, SEIU Local 2015. Butler's leadership extended to her election as president of the California SEIU State Council in 2013. She actively campaigned for an increased minimum wage in California and advocated for higher income taxes on the state's wealthiest citizens. During the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, while leading SEIU Local 2015, Butler endorsed Hillary Clinton.

In 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown appointed Butler to a 12-year term as a regent of the University of California. She resigned from her role as regent in 2021.

Butler became a partner at SCRB Strategies, a California-based political-consulting firm, in 2018. While at SCRB, she played a pivotal role in Kamala Harris's 2020 presidential campaign and maintained a longstanding political alliance with Harris, dating back to Harris's initial run for California Attorney General in 2010, where she helped negotiate a shared SEIU endorsement for Harris. Additionally, Butler provided counsel to Uber in labor-related matters during her tenure at SCRB. In 2020, Butler transitioned to a role as the director of public policy and campaigns in North America for Airbnb, leaving SCRB.

In 2021, Butler was appointed as the third president of EMILY's List, becoming the first black woman and first mother to lead the organization. In February 2022, she joined the board of directors of Vision to Learn.

#### U.S. Senate

Butler took her oath of office in the Senate on October 3, 2023, administered by Vice President Kamala Harris. Fellow California Senator Alex Padilla and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer were present for the ceremony.

On October 1, 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom chose Butler to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the passing of Laphonza R. Butler, fulfilling his commitment to appoint a black woman to the position. Butler was selected despite not being a resident of California, as she had relocated to Maryland in 2021. The United States Constitution requires only that senators be "inhabitants" of the state they represent, and Newsom's office confirmed that Butler would re-register to vote in California before assuming her senatorial duties.

Upon taking office on October 3, 2023, Butler made history as the first openly LGBT member of the U.S. Senate from California and the first black lesbian to serve in the Senate.

#### Personal Life

Butler is openly lesbian, and she and her spouse, Neneki Lee, are parents to a daughter. They made their move to Silver Spring, Maryland, in 2021 when Butler assumed the presidency of EMILY's List, while also maintaining ownership of a residence in View Park, California, in Los Angeles County. When Newsom appointed her to the Senate in October 2023, she officially re-established residency in that California home and re-registered to vote in the state.
