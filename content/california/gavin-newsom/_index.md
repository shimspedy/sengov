Gavin Newsom is the Governor of California, former Lieutenant Governor of California, and former Mayor of San Francisco.

Newsom is widely recognized for his willingness to lead – repeatedly developing, advocating, and implementing innovative and groundbreaking solutions to some of our most challenging issues. On a wide range of topics including same-sex marriage, gun safety, marijuana, the death penalty, universal health care, access to preschool, technology, criminal justice reform, and the minimum wage, Newsom stuck his neck out and did the right thing, which often led to sweeping changes when his policies were ultimately accepted, embraced, and replicated across the state and nation.

Newsom’s top priorities for his administration are tackling our state’s affordability crisis, creating inclusive economic growth and opportunity for every child, and standing up for California values — from civil rights, to immigration, environmental protection, access to quality schools at all levels, and justice.

Governor Newsom is married to Jennifer Siebel Newsom.They have four children: Montana, Hunter, Brooklynn, and Dutch.

Governor Gavin Newsom is boldly leading California through an unprecedented series of crises, including devastating wildfires, an economic downturn and the worst pandemic in 100 years.

Gavin is working every day against difficult odds to keep Californians safe, distribute vaccines, protect families from eviction and provide billions in direct relief to individuals and small businesses.

He first gained national recognition as a chief early advocate for marriage equality and marijuana decriminalization. Gavin is a champion for California values–from civil rights to immigration to environmental protection, education and expanding opportunity, and justice for all Californians.
