Congressman Kevin Kiley proudly serves the people of California’s 3rd District in the House of Representatives in his first term in office. He is dedicated to using his position to promote fiscally sound policies to reduce inflation, increase choice in education, and responsibly manage our public lands to preserve our beautiful forests and prevent catastrophic wildfires.

The son of a special education teacher, Kevin was born in the district and attended its local public schools. He began his career as a 10th grade English teacher at Manual Arts High School in inner-city Los Angeles. There, he chaired the English Department, led his students to significant academic gains, and founded an award-winning speech and debate team. After graduating law school, Kevin helped prosecute the civil case against China’s Huawei Technologies for intellectual property theft and defended the Constitution in California courts. Later, Kevin became a prosecutor and represented the People of California against violent felons as Deputy Attorney General.

Kevin was first elected to the California State Assembly in 2016. In his six years in the State Legislature, Kevin introduced the most significant school choice legislation in recent years and authored groundbreaking new laws on protections for sexual assault victims, privacy, criminal justice reform, and freedom of speech. In 2020, he was named National Legislator of the Year by the Association of Independent Workers for his work advancing economic freedom.

Each year in the Legislature, Kevin gave up $40,000 in annual income by declining the per diem allowance, declined a pay raise granted to the governor and legislature in 2021, and also introduced legislation to end special perks like a private DMV office that is available exclusively to state lawmakers and their staff.

Kevin holds a bachelor’s degree from Harvard, a law degree from Yale, and a master’s in secondary education from Loyola Marymount.

#### Committees
Congressman Kiley is proud to serve on the House Judiciary Committee and was appointed to three subcommittees: the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government; the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet; and the Subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance. Rep. Kiley also serves on the Education and the Workforce Committee and is Chair of the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, as well as a member of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education.

#### About Kevin Kiley
Kevin Kiley was elected to the California State Assembly in 2016 and has twice been reelected by substantial margins. In the 2020 election, he received more votes than any Republican in California history.

The son of a Special Education teacher, Kevin began his career as a high school teacher in inner-city Los Angeles, where he chaired the English Department and led his students to significant academic gains.

Later as an attorney, Kevin defended the U.S. Constitution in California courts and helped prosecute the civil case against China’s Huawei Technologies for intellectual property theft. He left private practice to become a prosecutor and Deputy Attorney General, representing the People of California in cases against violent felons. In November of 2020, Kevin and fellow legislator James Gallagher made use of their legal training by winning a trial against Governor Newsom for violating the separation of powers.

In five years in the Legislature, Kevin has authored groundbreaking new laws on freedom of speech, artificial intelligence, privacy, criminal justice reform, and protections for sexual assault victims, along with introducing the most significant school choice legislation in recent years. For his work advancing economic freedom, in 2020 he was named the national Legislator of the Year by the Association of Independent Workers.

Each year in the Legislature, Kevin has declined the per diem allowance, giving up $40,000 in income annually. He also declined a pay raise granted to the Governor and Legislature in 2021, and he has introduced legislation to end special perks like a private DMV office that is available exclusively to state lawmakers and their staff.

Kevin holds a bachelor’s degree from Harvard, a law degree from Yale, and a master’s in secondary education from Loyola Marymount. He has also served as an adjunct professor at McGeorge School of Law.

#### GAS PRICES

Kevin has led efforts to suspend California’ sky-high gas taxes. In Congress, he will work to bring gas prices down by making America energy independent and reducing fees and taxes on energy production.

#### INFLATION

Out of control spending by the Pelosi Congress has caused the inflation crisis. Kevin Kiley will attack out-of-control debt by prioritizing spending. He supports a balanced budget and debt reduction.

#### TAXES

Kevin Kiley believes taxes on the middle class and small businesses are too high. He opposed the Biden-Pelosi tax increases passed this year and will work to reduce the tax burden on middle income families and small business.

#### ECONOMY

Kevin will work to cut excessive government regulations that drive businesses and jobs away. He will fight to reduce the regulatory burden so the economy can keep growing.

#### CRIME

A former Prosecutor, Kevin Kiley worked to keep dangerous criminals locked up. He supports toughening the laws against violent and repeat offenders.

#### IMMIGRATION

Kevin supports stronger border security to stop illegal immigration and opposes California’s crazy sanctuary city laws that defy the U.S. Constitution and tie the hands of law enforcement.

#### NATIONAL DEFENSE & VETERANS

Kevin supports a strong and effective military ready to meet any challenge. He wants better treatment for veterans and active duty families and will fight to reform the VA to make sure America’s vets are taken care of – because they deserve nothing less.

#### FOREIGN POLICY

Kevin Kiley understands that Vladimir Putin’s Russia is not America’s friend and that China is an adversary not to be taken lightly. He believes that the United States and its allies need to stand together to support freedom and democracy and is a strong supporter of Israel.

#### FIRE PROTECTION

Kevin knows that poor forest management and drought have made California’s fire seasons worse. He will work to improve forest management so undergrowth and deadwood can be cleared.
