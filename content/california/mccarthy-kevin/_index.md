Kevin Owen McCarthy, born on January 26, 1965, is an American politician who held the prestigious position of the 55th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from January to October 2023. A dedicated member of the Republican Party, he represented California’s 20th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2007 until his resignation in 2023.

McCarthy’s journey in public service began at California State University, Bakersfield, where he earned his degree. Prior to his election to the U.S. House in 2006, he served two terms as a member of the California State Assembly. His commitment to leadership was evident during his tenure as the House Republican chief deputy whip from 2009 to 2011 and as the House majority whip from 2011 to 201412.

Following the 2014 Republican primary, where House Majority Leader Eric Cantor faced defeat, McCarthy stepped into the role of majority leader under Speaker John Boehner. He continued in this position during Paul Ryan’s speakership. In 2019, after Ryan’s retirement, McCarthy assumed the role of House Minority Leader.

As Minority Leader, McCarthy found himself navigating the turbulent waters of American politics. He initially supported Donald Trump’s unproven claims of voter fraud following Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. However, after the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol during the electoral vote count, McCarthy shifted his stance, attributing blame to Trump for the ensuing chaos . By 2022, he had publicly reconciled with the former president.

In January 2023, McCarthy emerged as the Republican nominee for Speaker, but his path to the speakership was far from straightforward. After 15 historic ballots and intense negotiations within his own party, he finally secured the office. As Speaker, McCarthy grappled with the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis, a standoff between the House Republican conference and the Biden administration, which threatened to trigger a first-ever national default.
