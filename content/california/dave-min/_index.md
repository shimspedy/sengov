Representative Dave Min was elected in 2024 to represent California’s 47th Congressional District in the heart of Orange County, which includes the cities of Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, Irvine, Laguna Beach, Newport Beach and Seal Beach, as well as parts of Laguna Hills and Laguna Woods.

Dave is the child of Korean immigrants and a product of California public schools, who lives in Irvine with his wife Jane and their three children. He previously served as a California State Senator from 2020-2024, where he focused on affordable housing, gun violence prevention, climate action and small business development.

As a State Senator, Dave chaired the Natural Resources and Water Committee and authored more than 30 laws, including many first-in-the-nation bills in the areas of domestic violence (including the first law in the world to recognize reproductive coercion as a form of domestic violence), gun violence prevention (including the first law in the country banning the sale of guns and ammunition on all state property), and environmental protection (including the first law in the United States to codify the 30x30 goals outlined by leading scientists to protect 30% of our open spaces and coastal waters by the year 2030). Dave also was responsible for bringing more than $70 million in direct appropriations to Orange County for local priorities including open space preservation, parks, and wildfire prevention.

Before becoming an elected official, Congressmember Min was a law professor at UC Irvine, where he taught and researched in the area of business law. At that time, he was considered one of the country’s leading experts on banking and housing policy, and testified six times before Congress on these issues.

Dave is a proud alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned degrees in the College of Arts and Sciences (B.A. Philosophy) and the Wharton School of Business (B.S. Economics), and Harvard Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctorate. Dave began his career prosecuting Wall Street fraud at the Securities and Exchange Commission, where he served as an Enforcement Attorney.

Dave’s basic philosophy of governance is one of long-termism, summed up by this quote from the ancient Greeks: A civilization is great when its elders plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in.
