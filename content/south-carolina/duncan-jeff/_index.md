#### DEBT & SPENDING
Congressman Duncan is proud to have one of the highest rankings in all of Congress on fiscal responsibility. Our nation is not in debt because we tax Americans too little, our nation is in debt because our government spends too much money. Duncan has consistently voted for spending cuts in Washington, and has authored and co-sponsored numerous pieces of legislation to drastically cut federal spending. Jeff is a strong advocate for a balanced budget amendment, and has pushed for the adoption of federal spending caps.

#### NATIONAL DEFENSE
The defense and security of our nation is one of the few areas that our Founding Fathers recognized needed to be a federal issue. Congressman Duncan believes a strong national defense starts with taking care of those who are willing to put on a uniform in defense of freedom, both during and after their term of service. That also means putting political correctness aside, and taking steps to eliminate the threat of radical Islamic terrorism both at home and abroad.
