#### Chris Jones for governor 
As a son of two preachers, I was raised with a strong sense of faith. This faith has never collided with my love for science — in fact, it only made it grow stronger. I attended Morehouse College on a NASA Scholarship, for physics and math, then studied at MIT to become a nuclear engineer and earn a Ph.D. in urban planning. I was blessed to run the Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub, which provided the tools and technology Arkansans needed to build businesses and create jobs.

Our campaign is the most ambitious effort in history to reach Arkansas voters. By hitting the road to talk with voters in all 75 counties, our Promise of Arkansas tour set the table to launch an unprecedented voting movement in a state with some of the highest potential and highest stakes in the nation. We are committed to changing what it means to campaign in Arkansas, by listening and learning from all communities, by building an enduring and resilient grassroots campaign, and by sharing our vision – that Arkansas can realize its potential and reach its promise through Faith, Hope & Hard Work.

The Promise of Arkansas is the Faith that together we can address our challenges. As an engineer, minister, and former non-profit leader, with deep roots in Arkansas, Chris Jones has the experience to lead, passion to enact change, and work ethic to work for every Arkansan.

No residential community should be made to suffer unintended or hidden impacts of potentially hazardous industry in their backyards. Economic development and developing our communities should always go hand in hand.
