#### Living Proof: Tim Scott's Journey from Poverty to Politics

I am living proof that America is the land of opportunity. My journey from being raised in poverty by a single mother to becoming a candidate for the presidency of the United States demonstrates the power of faith, perseverance, and patriotism. In this blog post, I will share my story and address how the Biden liberals are attacking every rung of the ladder that helped me climb. As a proud American, I stand against indoctrination in our schools, inflation in our economy, crime in our neighborhoods, and victimhood in our culture.

#### Stubborn Faith: A Lesson from My Mother

My mother was a resilient and determined woman who instilled in me the importance of having stubborn faith. She taught me to believe in God, in myself, and in America. Her strength and guidance were instrumental in helping me rise from a child of poverty to a successful politician and a candidate for the President of the United States.

We chose patriotism over pity and embraced our roles as *victors* rather than *victims*. My story is a testimony to the power of faith and the opportunities available to those who believe in and work for a better future.

#### Climbing the Ladder: The Role of Opportunity

As a product of the American Dream, I feel a deep connection to the ladder of opportunity that has allowed me to succeed. However, it pains my soul to see the Biden liberals attacking every rung of that ladder:

- **Indoctrination in our schools:** Instead of providing an unbiased education that encourages critical thinking, we are witnessing a rise in indoctrination that pushes a specific agenda and stifles open debate.
- **Inflation in our economy:** The current administration's policies have led to runaway inflation, making it even more difficult for hardworking Americans to provide for their families and get ahead financially.
- **Crime in our neighborhoods:** The push to defund the police and the growing tolerance for criminal behavior have made our communities less safe. This is particularly harmful to low-income families who suffer the most from high crime rates.
- **Victimhood in our culture:** The radical left promotes a culture of victimhood that discourages personal responsibility and undermines the idea of individual agency. This mentality is counterproductive to building a resilient and prosperous society.

#### The Truth of My Life: Rejecting the Lies of the Radical Left

The radical left claims that America is an evil, declining country, but the truth of my life disprove their lies. The opportunities and successes I have experienced in this great nation are a testament to the potential available to all of its citizens. I refuse to accept the defeatist and pessimistic outlook presented by the far left, and I will continue to fight for the American Dream.

#### Faith in America: The Message of My Campaign

I, Tim Scott, approve of this message because I have unwavering faith in America. I believe in the opportunities this country provides and the potential for greatness among its citizens. Our President should have confidence in America, too.

Throughout my political career, I have fought for policies that promote opportunity, personal responsibility, and a strong sense of patriotism. I will continue to defend the values that make America a beacon of hope for those who seek a better life.

Join me in this crucial fight to protect the American Dream and ensure that future generations have the same opportunities to rise above their circumstances that I did. Together, we can stand against the forces that seek to undermine our nation's foundational ideals and preserve the values that make America a land of opportunity.

### TIM’S RECORD

#### BORDER SECURITY

“On my first day as Commander-in-Chief, the strongest nation on Earth will stop retreating from our own southern border. If you don’t control your back door, it’s not your house. And if our southern border is unsafe and insecure, it’s not our country.”

Border security is national security. If we want to prevent deadly drugs like fentanyl from infiltrating our communities, we need to stop the illegal immigrants who bring them across our borders. The cartels won’t stop pumping drugs and violence into American communities until we stop them, either with a strong border wall or by military force. Biden’s failure to address the crisis at our southern border has turned every county in America into a border county.

- Expel illegal immigrants trying to enter the country by reinstating Title 42 to combat the fentanyl crisis.
- Fully fund the construction of the wall at the southern border, while strengthening law enforcement’s capabilities to detect drug smugglers and human traffickers before they enter our country.
- End Biden’s “Catch and release” policies which weaken our nation’s security, and undermine our nation’s sovereignty.
- Recognize drug cartels as terrorists and let the world’s greatest military power defend our borders and our lives. 
##### A Proven Record: 
- Combatting The Fentanyl Crisis: Leading with legislation – the FEND Off Fentanyl Act – to sanction those supplying the deadly drugs, whether it is the suppliers in Chinese labs or the traffickers in Mexico.

- Securing Our Border Act: While Biden and congressional Democrats chose to spend $45 billion of taxpayer money to hire an army of IRS agents to target the middle class, we must redirect those resources into border security and give Border Patrol the support they need to keep our nation secure. To do so also means ending Biden’s catch-and-release agenda.

- Alan T. Shao II Fentanyl Public Health Emergency and Overdose Prevention Act: Utilize the powers outlined in Title 42 to address the true national public health emergency that is the raging fentanyl epidemic Biden has allowed to go unchecked. My good friend Alan Shao lost his 27-year-old son due to a fentanyl overdose, fentanyl that is being trafficked across the southern border.

#### EDUCATION, NOT INDOCTRINATION
“I have lived the truth that education is the closest thing to magic in America. But today, the far left has us retreating away from excellence in our schools. Extreme liberals are letting Big Labor bosses trap millions of kids in failing systems. They’re replacing education with indoctrination.”

America’s children should be learning ABCs, not CRT. The radical Left wants to indoctrinate our children, not educate them. We will fight to ensure that America’s kids are learning how to read and write, not about gender transition and sexual identity. We must demand excellence in our schools, which means giving every family a choice, every parent a voice, and every child a chance.

- Defend parental rights by giving every family the power and resources they need to decide their child’s education and future.

- Demand transparency in the classroom so parents are informed as to what their children learn in school.

- Expand opportunities for all children by embracing education freedom and empowering parents, which will allow millions of children to unlock their God-given potential.
##### A Proven Record: 
- The CHOICE Act: Ensures parents have the tools to find a school that can effectively serve their child’s needs and grants flexibility and support to parents with disabled children.

- Training America’s Workforce Act: Empower apprenticeship programs because every child deserves the opportunity to achieve their version of the American Dream.

- Kids in Classes Act: Big Labor Bosses have kept children out of classrooms, so this legislation would allow families to put unused Title I funds toward further choices for in-person education.

- Educational Choice for Children Act: Provides $10 billion in annual tax credits for Scholarship Grant Organizations.

- PROTECT Kids Act: Cut off federal funding from any school that allows students to change their pronouns, gender markers, or sex-based accommodations including locker rooms and bathrooms, without their parents’ consent.

#### CONSERVATIVE VALUES AND GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS
“Under Joe Biden, we have become a nation in retreat. Retreating from religious liberty and the worship of God himself. I will preserve one nation, Under God, indivisible — where we honor our Creator and respect every innocent life.”

Conservatism is the home of common sense. The radical Left has tried its best to remove faith, patriotism, and religious liberty from our society, but we won’t back down. It’s time for new conservative leadership to bring Americans together with faith: Faith in God, faith in each other, and faith in America.

- Life has intrinsic value because it comes from God. With a 100% pro-life voting record, we must stand up against the radical left pushing taxpayer-funded abortion up until the moment of birth. This starts by fostering a culture of life, and winning the hearts and minds of Americans.

- Celebrate our Founding Fathers, not cancel them. Americans have won the lottery of citizenship. Each generation must pass on the appreciation for the magnificence of our U.S. Constitution and the God-given rights it protects while cherishing the power of American exceptionalism.

- Individual Responsibility is an American value. If you are able-bodied, you work. You don’t spend what you don’t have. If you take out a loan, you pay it back. If you commit a violent crime, you go to jail. It’s common sense.

##### A Proven Record: 
- 100% Pro-Life: 100% score from National Right to Life and an A-rating from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

- Child Tax Credit for Pregnant Moms Act: Allowing pregnant moms to claim the Child Tax Credit for their unborn children, to further protect life, support mothers, and reduce the number of kids born into poverty. 

- Defending the Second Amendment: Holds an A-rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and Gun Owners of America.

- Lifting Local Communities Act: Leading on a bill to allow faith-based organizations to apply for, and receive government grants without the fear of government overreach. 

#### NATIONAL SECURITY
“Security starts on our borders, but it doesn’t end there. The Chinese Communist Party’s goal is not just to surpass us. It is to beat us. As President, I will rebuild a military so lethal and powerful that our adversaries will fear us and our allies will respect us.”

Joe Biden and the radical Left have shown weakness on a global stage, and have made our adversaries bolder. Defeating China starts with reducing our soaring national debt and removing the Chinese Communist Party from our universities, our farmland, our personal data, and our skies.

- Peace through strength can only be achieved if we have the most capable fighting force on the planet. My father and my brothers have 85 years of combined military service between them. When I am President, our service members will have every tool they need, and our veterans will have every resource they deserve. We must steadfastly support those who risk their lives to protect our freedom and ensure they have the modern capabilities they need to address the threats of tomorrow.

- Economic prosperity promotes stability and security — here at home and around the world. As Biden sends us deeper and deeper in debt to the Chinese Communist Party, he only further fuels China’s rise. And we will win the next century by the strength of our economy. China started this new economic Cold War, but America will finish it.

- Our military is not a social experiment, and we must show the world we are prepared and serious about winning the next century.

#### A Proven Record:
- Senate Foreign Relations: ​​Senator Scott currently serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has jurisdiction over all matters of U.S. foreign policy. Within the committee, he is the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy.

- Senate Banking Committee: Senator Scott is the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which has jurisdiction over the national security work of the U.S. Treasury and the Department of Commerce, including economic sanctions and foreign trade.

- U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum Council: For several years, Senator Scott has served on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. As a member of the council, he supports the museum’s work to educate the American people about the horrors of the Holocaust and combat anti-semitism.

- Senate Armed Services Committee: Senator Scott previously served on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which oversees the U.S. Department of Defense and all U.S. military activities—at home and abroad.

#### LAW AND ORDER
“In Biden’s America, crime is on the rise and law enforcement is in retreat. The far left is ending cash bail. They’re demonizing, demoralizing, and de-funding the police. I grew up in neighborhoods alongside people who ended up incarcerated or in a cemetery. We needed more public safety, not less!”

Joe Biden and the radical Left’s agenda isn’t about protecting communities, they seek to promote chaos and fear under the guise of “fairness.” We must break the concept in this nation that you have to be for law enforcement or for communities of color. That is a false binary choice. We must re-fund our police and support public safety, because we cannot have innocent people at risk, police officers getting attacked and ambushed, and seniors locked in their homes in fear from sundown until sunup.

- Supporting law enforcement: One out of every four law enforcement officer positions remains vacant. They can’t get people to do the job. President Biden has blamed the police, allowed for the Democrats to defund the police, and they’ve demonized the actual law enforcement profession.

- End sanctuary cities to stop illegal immigration, allowing local law enforcement to work with federal immigration authorities.

- Increase the penalties for criminals who intentionally target law enforcement officers.
##### A Proven Record:
- Recognized by law enforcement: Awarded the FSA National Legislative Champion Award from the Florida Sheriffs Association and the Major County Sheriffs of America Legislative Champion Award.

- Combating Violent and Dangerous Crime Act: Strengthens violent crime laws related to attacks on law enforcement, bank robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, and other offenses.

- Back the Blue Act: Increase penalties for criminals who intentionally target law enforcement officers and provide new tools for officers to protect themselves.

- Safe Kids, Safe Schools, and Safe Communities Act: Fund enhanced school security, doubling the number of school resource officers in America’s schools and investing in school mental health professionals.

#### CREATE OPPORTUNITIES AND GROW WAGES
“I am living proof that America is the land of opportunity, not a land of oppression. The circumstances may be different, the details may change, but every one of us is here because of an American journey where there were obstacles that became opportunities.”

Biden and the left have taxed, borrowed, and spent trillions of dollars trying to replace a hand up with handouts. All they bought us was crushing inflation that has devastated families like yours and mine. We must rebuild and restore every rung of the ladder that helped me climb. Because I want my American story to pale in comparison to you.

- Made in America agenda that ramps up research and development, reclaims supply chains, and re-energizes our manufacturing base with Opportunity Zones 2.0.
- Unleash American energy and innovation by removing burdensome red tape, cutting taxes, and expanding an all-of-the-above energy approach.

- Live within our means, by reining in the left’s out-of-control spending, ending earmarks and political favors, and making tax cuts permanent.

##### A Proven Record:
- Lead author of the Republican tax cuts: Slashed taxes for families, brought jobs and investment back from overseas, and created Opportunity Zones to inject private dollars into communities that have been left behind. We spurred high employment, low inflation, and fast wage growth for the working class.

- Championing Opportunity Zones: The most impactful anti-poverty program in the past 50 years, by generating private sector investments into nearly 4,000 communities across the country. Households have seen their personal lives, financial security, and standard of living improve as a result of local investments.

- Permanently fund HBCUs: Provide for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, without putting taxpayers on the hook.

- Expanding Access to Credit for Small Businesses Act: Opens up access to credit for small businesses, particularly rural and minority-owned businesses owners, who are less likely to have relationships with traditional banking institutions, would have the much needed access to fulfill their American dream.
