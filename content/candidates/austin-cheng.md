Austin Franklin Cheng, a native New Yorker and first-generation American, has established himself as a multifaceted leader, embodying the American Dream his immigrant parents pursued. His journey, shaped by his parents' dedication and service, has led him to various roles and achievements. 

Austin grew up in Queens, observing his parents' hard work and sacrifices. He attended Birch Elementary School, Marie Curie Middle School, and Benjamin Cardozo High School, where he engaged in the Da Vinci Science Program. Later, he moved to Long Island, continuing his education at Portledge School and then earning a Political Science degree from Union College in 2011. His college years marked the beginning of his commitment to serving the country, evidenced by his participation in the U.S. Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and achieving recognition as a Distinguished Military Graduate.

Post-college, Austin pursued a law degree from Brooklyn Law School, graduating in 2014. During this time, he gained practical business experience through internships at his family's surgery center and even earned his private pilot's license. His legal career commenced with active duty service in the U.S. Army as a Judge Advocate (JAG) Corps attorney, where he was the sole criminal military prosecutor at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, later transitioning to a criminal defense attorney role at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.

In 2019, Austin's career took a significant turn when he returned to New York to support his family. Following his mother's illness and subsequent passing, he assumed the role of CEO at Gramercy Surgery Center, leading the company through the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under his leadership, the center was recognized among the top ambulatory surgery centers in New York State and continued to prioritize affordable, quality patient care.

Beyond his professional endeavors, Austin is deeply involved in community service and political engagement. He holds various positions, including Vice President of the Kissena Democratic Club and board member roles in several organizations. Additionally, Austin, a Major in the U.S. Army Reserves, enjoys exploring national parks and practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

His life and career are testaments to his resilience, collaborative spirit, and dedication to embodying the values instilled by his parents.

#### Cost of Living

In a period of historic inflation, the cost of living has never been greater, making it difficult for some Queens and Long Island families to make ends meet. As a resident and small business owner here in New York, I've experienced firsthand the challenges that continual tax hikes present to businesses and families alike. Long Island homeowners also feel the weight of these increases, with property taxes soaring.  As the Representative for NY-3, I'll explore measures like small business tax breaks, property tax caps, and targeted relief, especially for fixed-income people.

- Inflation

Residents across our district share concerns about inflation that impacts everything from our groceries to gas. As your voice in Congress, I will actively shape solutions that ensure Long Island thrives, even amidst economic challenges. Our businesses are the backbone of our local economy, and inflation affects them as much as it affects us. When their costs rise, so do ours. I will commit to writing and sponsoring legislation that offers temporary tax reliefs and incentives for those businesses, fostering an environment where they can absorb costs without passing them on to consumers and helping to stabilize our local prices. I will also push for federal research grants and funding for Long Island’s universities and colleges, making NY-03 a hub for innovation. By driving technological and sustainable advancement, we insulate our community from global economic shocks. Inflation might be a complex challenge, but together, we'll face it head-on. With pragmatic policy, a forward-looking vision, and a commitment to every resident of Long Island, we will ensure NY-03 remains a beacon of economic resilience and prosperity.


- Taxes

As a small business owner here in New York, I've experienced firsthand the challenges that continual tax hikes present to businesses and families alike. At Gramercy Surgery Center, I've managed budgets and made tough financial decisions while adjusting to New York’s ever-changing business environment. Just as I've always prioritized transparency in healthcare, I'll advocate for full transparency in how tax dollars are spent through a comprehensive review of where our tax dollars are going, ensuring accountability and value for every dollar. Our small businesses are the heart of Long Island, and rising taxes shouldn’t weigh them down. We must explore tax incentives and breaks for businesses that hire locally, invest in sustainable practices, or contribute to the community in meaningful ways. Long Island homeowners also feel the weight of these increases, with property taxes soaring. I'll explore measures like property tax caps or targeted relief, especially for fixed-income people. Financial responsibility and fair taxation aren't Democratic or Republican principles; they're New York principles. Together, we can find balanced, effective solutions for our community.


- Jobs

Every member of our community deserves a well-paying job that paves the way for a brighter tomorrow. To achieve this, we must reinvest in Long Island's infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our energy infrastructure, and our public transit systems are the lifeblood of our communities. By allocating substantial federal resources here, we won’t only be improving our daily commutes, protecting our homes, or ensuring safer travels — we will be creating thousands of jobs right here at home in construction, engineering, and related fields. I will also advocate for policies that make Long Island a leader in green jobs, harnessing the power of our coastal winds, the strength of our sun, and the energy of our waves. By doing so, we won't just be helping the environment — we will be seeding an industry full of clean energy jobs from manufacturing and installation to maintenance. By focusing on infrastructure and green energy, we can cultivate a prosperous future for our district and its residents.

Financial responsibility and fair taxation aren't Democratic or Republican principles; they're New York principles.  

I will advocate for federal funding and support for housing, healthcare, and energy initiatives that benefit our region, ensuring that Queens and Long Island residents aren't once again being burdened with state and federal bandaid solutions.

#### Healthcare

I firmly believe that every American deserves access to top-tier medical care regardless of their financial status. 

As the CEO of an award-winning surgical center right here in New York, I have the insider's view on our healthcare system’s challenges and opportunities. I will advocate for reforms in the insurance industry to make coverage more affordable and reduce out-of-pocket expenses and push for legislation to expand telehealth coverage, working hand-in-hand with healthcare providers to understand the real-world challenges our healthcare system faces and bring substantive solutions to the people of New York. 

My experiences in the field have shaped my commitment to pushing for reforms that will benefit every American, ensuring that no one has to choose between their health and their wallet.

#### SALT

The State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction has been a cornerstone of our federal tax system since its inception. It provides crucial relief to taxpayers in high-tax states like New York by allowing them to deduct state and local taxes from their federal taxable income. However, recent changes have placed an unjust cap on these deductions, disproportionately burdening middle-class families in NY-03 and communities like ours nationwide. I will champion efforts to lift the cap on the SALT. deduction, ensuring that residents in NY-03 can fully deduct their state and local taxes. This will not only provide tax relief but also validate the principle that no American should be taxed twice on the same dollar.

New York contributes more to the federal government in taxes than it gets back in federal funding, and restoring the full SALT deduction is a step toward rectifying this imbalance and ensuring our hard-earned dollars benefit our community. By lifting the SALT cap, we can protect our state and local government's ability to provide essential services without the pressure to reduce tax rates due to federal tax changes. Our schools, public safety, health services, and infrastructure depend on it.  As your representative, I am committed to restoring fairness in our tax system. The current SALT cap harms Queens and Long Island families, potentially leading to decreased home values and straining local budgets. Together, we can advocate for a tax policy that reflects our community's needs and ensures a prosperous

#### Inclusivity

Much like the United States as a whole, our district is home to an amazing mix of cultures, backgrounds, and stories. Inclusivity isn't just a buzzword—it's our north star, and we need to integrate it into the fabric of our policies.  Growing up on Long Island, my family was one of a handful of Asian American families in our town. Since then, minority communities have grown and become a greater portion of this district, but acts of hatred towards AAPI residents and others persist– I will work to protect all minorities in our district from acts of intolerance. For too long, certain voices in our community have been underrepresented. 

True inclusivity means ensuring that every resident—regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or ability—has a voice and seat at the table.  

I am committed to promoting educational programs in our public schools that highlight our diverse histories and contributions; and to advocating for policies that level the playing field through equal pay or budget equity initiatives and programs supporting minority and LGBTQ-owned businesses. I will also push for funding multilingual language access services in key community touchpoints, from public transport announcements to community health centers, and promote accessibility measures to ensure that every resident can engage fully with their community. Every step we take must ensure that NY-03 isn't just a district of residents but a united community of diverse voices, working hand in hand for a brighter, more equitable future.

#### Public Safety

Gun violence and public safety are not partisan issues; they affect all of us.

My top priority as your representative in Congress will be to keep Queens and Long Island families safe by working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle in Congress to craft effective, evidence-based solutions for our district and the nation. 

I'll advocate for proactive crime prevention strategies that address the root causes of crime, working to provide resources that better support our members of law enforcement, advocate for federal grants that support community policing initiatives, and ensure officers and residents have the tools and information needed to create safer neighborhoods for our families. 

As a military veteran and former criminal prosecutor, I have a deep understanding of discipline, order, and the rule of law and am committed to working with my colleagues to craft effective, evidence-based solutions for our district and the nation. I've taken oaths to protect our country and uphold our Constitution and legal system, and I'm ready to bring that dedication to Congress.

#### Fighting Climate Change

Climate change is not just a global threat, it’s a local challenge right here in our district. 

Rising sea levels, intensified storm surges, and fluctuating weather patterns directly impact our communities, threatening our homes, local businesses, and natural sanctuaries. Compounding these challenges, Long Island's water resources face contamination risks, with some communities having limited access to clean water. Historically marginalized and frontline communities are often the first to feel its impacts and the last to receive aid. It's high time we confront this two-pronged crisis: arresting the progress of climate change and ensuring environmental justice for all.


My vision for NY-03 is straightforward: a district fortified against climate threats through green infrastructure, technology and sustainable policies. 

In Congress, I will fight to allocate funds to enhance our district's flood defenses, including constructing sea walls, restoring natural wetlands, and developing urban green spaces that absorb excess water. I will also champion clean energy by increasing solar installations, promoting electric vehicles, and reducing our overall carbon footprint. Every resident, regardless of their background, deserves clean air, water, and access to green spaces.


Long Island’s bay and the aquifer system are our legacy. It's our duty to ensure that they remain sustainable and clean for our children, their children, and the generations beyond. While industrial growth has brought our district prosperity, it has also left behind pollutants in surface water and our unique sole-source aquifer system that gravely impact our fishing, tourism, and general quality of life. It’s not just an environmental concern, it’s a public health crisis, and in Congress, I will advocate for strong enforcement of environmental regulations so companies that pollute our waters are held accountable. I will also fight for investment in modern infrastructure that keeps our waterways and beaches clean. From green infrastructure to advanced water treatment methods, I will work to make Long Island a leader in clean water technology.

To make this vision a reality, we will need concrete policies: investing in renewable energy, tightening regulations on polluters, supporting upgrades to our public transit systems to be more efficient and green, and ensuring that all communities have a seat at the decision-making table. As your Congressman, my goal will not just be to combat climate change but to build a district where environmental benefits are shared equitably. Let’s work together to prioritize both the health of our community and our planet. 

#### Reproductive Rights

If elected, I will be an unyielding advocate for agency, dignity, and choice when it comes to reproductive rights. 

The right to choose is not just an issue in our district, it is a cornerstone of the very freedoms our nation cherishes. Every individual, no matter where they reside, deserves autonomy over their bodies.  As a healthcare executive for New York State's leading independent outpatient surgery center, I have worked in the community to ensure healthcare is focused around patients and their physicians. In Congress, I will not only continue to support this philosophy but will strongly oppose any legislation that seeks to roll back reproductive rights and champion federal laws that ensure access to safe and legal reproductive health services across all fifty states. Rights on paper mean little without practical access– every individual, irrespective of their socioeconomic background, should have the resources and facilities to exercise their reproductive rights. I will partner with pro-choice allies in New York’s Congressional delegation to secure federal funding for reproductive health clinics in underserved areas, ensuring that New Yorkers’ access to abortion care isn't dictated by zip code or financial standing. The journey to safeguarding reproductive rights is paved with challenges and resolve. 

#### Congestion Pricing

Long Island and Queens are home to a large number of commuters who contribute significantly to our city and state's economy and vibrancy. The burden of decisions made behind closed doors are once again falling on the shoulders of the hard working New Yorkers who are working hard every day to achieve their version of the American Dream. 

We must consider fair exemptions to drivers, like excluding those who enter the City from tolled bridges and tunnels, significantly discounting personal vehicles from fees on weekends and holidays, and providing discounts for low-income drivers or those with specific needs. 

#### Migrant Crisis

The United States of America and the American Dream are built on the backs of immigrants and New York has a proud history of welcoming immigrants to its shores. The stories of immigrants are the stories of Queens and Long Island – filled with hopes, dreams, and contributions that have helped shape our community. It is my family’s story too, and that’s why the egregious mishandling of the migrant crisis hits so close to home.

This crisis is more than a policy debate; it reflects our shared humanity. As a child of immigrants, I know that every individual seeking a better life on our shores has a story, and our response must be rooted in compassion and understanding. That starts by providing our country’s newest arrivals with the resources and services they need to build a brighter future.


I will support bills that establish new programs to assist immigrants and refugees overcome common challenges such as language barriers, obtaining employment and helping to break down obstacles to naturalization. I will make sure that Mayor Adams and my colleagues in Albany understand what this district’s newest residents need, advocating for a more humane and compassionate approach to welcoming refugees to our state.

At the same time, I will ensure that any plans to aid migrants, such as housing initiatives, are carefully crafted in collaboration with the community, instead of a last-minute surprise foisted on New Yorkers. Although New York has led the way in supporting immigration, this is a national initiative and responsibility should be borne fairly across the nation.

Although New York has led the way in supporting immigration, this is a national initiative and responsibility should be borne fairly across the nation. As your representative I will amplify your voices calling for federal support and funding for this national crisis.
