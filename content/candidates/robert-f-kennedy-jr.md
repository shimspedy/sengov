Bobby Kennedy, Jr. is a lifelong Democrat known for his unwavering dedication to public service and his tireless advocacy for environmental causes. Born into a prominent political family as the son of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy, Bobby embarked on a career of public service early in his life.

After passing the New York State Bar, Bobby began his journey in public service, eventually emerging as one of the United States' most influential environmentalists. His remarkable contributions to environmental protection have earned him global recognition, including being named TIME Magazine's "Hero of the Planet" and receiving the Sartisky Peace Award.

Bobby's career in environmental advocacy began in 1985 when he joined the environmental nonprofit organization RiverKeeper as a young attorney. In this role, he took on polluters, fought to ensure safe drinking water for American families, and worked to preserve the livelihood of fishing communities across the United States. His efforts included successfully suing both corrupt municipalities and corporate giants like General Electric and ExxonMobil, holding them accountable for environmental violations.

Expanding on the success of the RiverKeeper model, Bobby co-founded the WaterKeeper Alliance and served as its President for an impressive 21 years. Under his leadership, the alliance grew into the world's largest nonprofit dedicated to clean water, safeguarding an astounding 2.7 million miles of waterways with the help of over a million volunteers across the United States and 46 other countries.

Throughout his career, Bobby Kennedy, Jr. has been a steadfast advocate for marginalized communities battling corporate and government polluters. Some of his most notable achievements include representing the NAACP in a lawsuit to prevent the creation of a garbage transfer station in an underserved neighborhood in New York, standing with the Cree Indians in their fight against proposed dams on their tribal land, and negotiating with oil giant Conoco to limit the destruction of the Ecuadorian Amazon on behalf of the Confederation of Indian Peoples.

Bobby's commitment to environmental justice and public health is exemplified by his advocacy for mental health services, the removal of mercury from childhood vaccinations, and the restoration of standard product liability and placebo testing requirements for vaccine manufacturers.

In addition to his environmental work, Bobby Kennedy, Jr. has been an active supporter of Democratic candidates and leaders. He has endorsed and campaigned for prominent Democrats, including Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama. He has also authored several books, including "Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and his Corporate Pals are Plundering the Country and Hijacking our Democracy," which critically examines environmental policies.

Bobby Kennedy, Jr. is a dedicated supporter of union rights and has taken part in hunger strikes with the United Farm Workers. He has consistently championed the idea that hardworking individuals in the United States should be able to enjoy a good quality of life.

A true outdoorsman, master falconer, and white-water kayaker, Bobby has authored numerous books on a wide range of subjects, including environmental protection, American history, and public life. He founded EcoWatch, a prominent environmental news site, and served as an editor of Indian Country Today, the largest Indigenous newspaper in North America.

Recognized as the Father of the Year for his commitment to family, citizenship, charity, civility, responsibility, and reverence, Bobby Kennedy, Jr. is a proud father of seven children and a loving grandparent to two grandchildren. He shares his life with his devoted wife, actress Cheryl Hines, and is the leader of a unique pack that includes four dogs and two giant tortoises, who will accompany him to the White House.

**COST OF LIVING**

In a time when once a blue-collar worker with a high school education could provide for their family, take vacations, and save for retirement, it's disheartening to see that life today is often characterized by economic challenges. Technological advancements have significantly increased our productivity, yet many find themselves struggling to make ends meet.

**HOUSING**

The aspiration of owning a home is slipping out of reach for many Americans due to soaring mortgage rates, rising property prices, and stagnant incomes. To exacerbate matters, venture capital firms and hedge funds are amassing single-family homes in unprecedented numbers. As homeownership becomes a distant dream, the cost of renting is soaring to new heights.

**ENVIRONMENT**

Our mission is to unite Americans around the cause of ensuring safe and healthy food, clean water, pure air, and the preservation of our natural landscapes, including rivers, forests, grasslands, and wetlands. We will accelerate the transition to a regenerative agricultural system, promote the adoption of zero-waste practices, and champion clean energy sources.

**HONEST GOVERNMENT**

We are committed to transforming public institutions to serve the people once again. This means dismantling the walls of secrecy, ending mass surveillance, halting censorship, and ushering in a new era of transparent governance.

**RECONCILIATION**

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s campaign centers on the values that unite all Americans. We aspire to lead the nation towards a culture of respectful dialogue and reconciliation, transcending racial, partisan, and societal divisions.

**PEACE**

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is dedicated to ending foreign conflicts, bringing our troops home, and reallocating resources to reinvigorate America. This commitment involves revitalizing our infrastructure, rejuvenating our cities, bolstering industries, and enhancing public services.

**BORDER**

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. recognizes the situation at the border as primarily a humanitarian crisis, extending far beyond its geographical confines. The influx of migrants has overwhelmed resources in cities across the nation. The plight of these migrants, subjected to the exploitation of drug cartels, human traffickers, and unscrupulous employers, is truly heartbreaking.

**CIVIL LIBERTIES**

Civil liberties, especially freedom of speech, are of paramount importance to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. His commitment involves ending censorship and surveillance, reducing incarceration rates, and upholding the rights and dignity of all citizens.

**RACIAL HEALING**

Despite nearly six decades since the Civil Rights Act, disparities persist for Black Americans in areas such as income, wealth, education, infant mortality, homeownership, incarceration, health, and life expectancy. Our goal is to address these inequalities and strive for true equality.

**NATIVE AMERICANS**

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. inherits from his father a profound dedication to improving the lives of Native Americans. Like his father, he views the poverty and suffering in Indian Country as a deep-rooted national shame, recognizing that the federal government's unfair treatment and broken treaties with tribal nations are among our nation's most enduring sins.

**REVITALIZATION**

The time has come to reverse the economic decline in America. While supporting the nation's most vulnerable is a top priority, it is equally vital to rectify the policies that have perpetuated poverty. Learn more about our comprehensive plan to Turn the Tide and restore prosperity for all.
