America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable. It is a choice made by detached and cynical politicians. As a California resident, I’ve seen firsthand how decades of Democrat rule have turned the Golden State, for many, into an unaffordable dystopia. I won’t let them do the same to America. We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That’s why I’m running for President.

Larry Elder—the Sage from South Central—is a New York Times best-selling author, award-winning documentary filmmaker, and one of the best-known media figures in America today. His flagship daily radio program, “The Larry Elder Show,” was heard every weekday in all 50 states and on more than 300 stations.

Larry’s unique style, personal background, and professional experience combine to inspire, inform, and persuade his listeners, readers, and viewers to embrace the timeless American principles of personal responsibility and public accountability. In his words: “The question is not which party has my back, but which party can get government off our backs—so that we might all realize our God-given capabilities.”

Larry was born and raised in South Central Los Angeles, and his family’s story represents every bit of the American Dream. His father was born in Athens, Georgia, served in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, and moved to California to open his own restaurant—Elder’s Snack Bar. Larry’s mother, originally from Huntsville, Alabama, was a clerical worker for the U.S. Department of War (now the U.S. Department of Defense) and raised three boys as a stay-at-home mom.

After running for Governor of California in 2021 and securing millions of votes, Larry is now ready for the next step in his journey: running for President of the United States. We’ve got a country to save!
