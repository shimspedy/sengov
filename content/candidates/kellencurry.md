### Who is Kellen Curry?

Kellen Curry is a leader who has served his country, his community, and his family with honor and integrity. He is a veteran of the Afghanistan War, a former vice president at J.P. Morgan, and a candidate for Congress in New York's 3rd District.

#### A Proud Legacy of Service

Kellen Curry was born into a family of patriots who dedicated their lives to defending our nation. His grandfather was a World War II veteran who fought in the Battle of the Bulge. His father was a Vietnam War veteran who flew over 200 combat missions. Kellen followed in their footsteps and graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 2009. He received a commission as a second lieutenant and a degree in political science.

At the academy, Kellen learned the values of duty, honor, and country from his mentors and peers. He also met his wife, Sarah, who was a fellow cadet and now serves as a nurse practitioner. They have two children, Jack and Emma, who are the joy of their lives.

Kellen's first assignment was at the Pentagon, where he worked as a budget analyst for the Air Force's cyber warfare programs. He held a top secret clearance and was responsible for managing billions of dollars in taxpayer funds. He ensured that our military had the best technology and equipment to protect our nation from cyber attacks.

In 2011, Kellen volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. He served as a liaison officer between the U.S. and Afghan forces, coordinating air support and intelligence sharing. He traveled across the country, witnessing the harsh realities of war and the resilience of the Afghan people. He also lost some of his friends and classmates, who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.

Kellen returned home with a Bronze Star Medal and a Purple Heart, as well as a deep appreciation for the men and women who serve in uniform. He also realized that our nation faced new and complex challenges that required fresh and innovative solutions.

#### A Passion for Progress

Kellen decided to pursue a career in the private sector, where he could apply his skills and experience to help grow our economy and create jobs. He joined J.P. Morgan, one of the world's leading financial institutions, as a vice president in the corporate and investment banking division. He advised some of the largest and most influential companies in the world on their strategic and financial decisions. He also helped small and medium-sized businesses access capital and expand their operations.

Kellen gained a deep understanding of how the financial market affects every aspect of our society, from education and health care to infrastructure and energy. He also witnessed how government policies and regulations can either foster or hinder economic growth and innovation. He became convinced that our nation needed leaders who understood the intricacies and interdependencies of our global economy and who could advocate for the best interests of our communities.

#### A Vision for the Future

Kellen believes that America is the greatest country in the world, but that it can be even better. He believes that we need honest and effective leadership in Washington D.C. to address the issues that matter most to our families and children. He believes that we need to restore trust and transparency in our government and hold our elected officials accountable for their actions. He believes that we need to secure our borders and our homeland, while also maintaining our alliances and our values. He believes that we need to balance our budget and reduce our debt, while also investing in our infrastructure and our military. He believes that we need to unleash our potential and win the 21st century, while also preserving our environment and our heritage.

That's why Kellen is running for Congress in New York's 3rd District. He wants to represent the people of Long Island, where he grew up and where he lives with his family. He wants to bring his experience, his knowledge, and his passion to the halls of Congress. He wants to be a voice for the people, not for the parties or the special interests. He wants to lead with courage, with compassion, and with common sense.

Kellen Curry is ready to serve. He is ready to lead. He is ready to make a difference.

Join him in his mission to make our district, our state, and our country a better place for all.
