Michael R. Pence was born in Columbus, Indiana, on June 7, 1959, one of six children born to Edward and Nancy Pence. As a young boy he had a front row seat to the American Dream. After his grandfather immigrated to the United States when he was 17, his family settled in the Midwest. The future Vice President watched his Mom and Dad build everything that matters—a family, a business, and a good name. Sitting at the feet of his mother and his father, who started a successful convenience store business in their small Indiana town, he was raised to believe in the importance of hard work, faith, and family.


Vice President Pence set off for Hanover College, earning his bachelor’s degree in history in 1981. While there, he renewed his Christian faith which remains the driving force in his life. He later attended Indiana University School of Law and met the love of his life, Second Lady Karen Pence.

After graduating, Vice President Pence practiced law, led the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, and began hosting The Mike Pence Show, a syndicated talk radio show and a weekly television public affairs program in Indiana. Along the way he became the proud father to three children, Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.

Growing up in Indiana, surrounded by good, hardworking Hoosiers, Vice President Pence always knew that he needed to give back to the state and the country that had given him so much. In 2000, he launched a successful bid for his local congressional seat, entering the United States House of Representatives at the age of 40.

The people of East-Central Indiana elected Vice President Pence six times to represent them in Congress. On Capitol Hill he established himself as a champion of limited government, fiscal responsibility, economic development, educational opportunity, and the U.S. Constitution. His colleagues quickly recognized his leadership ability and unanimously elected him to serve as Chairman of the House Republican Study Committee and House Republican Conference Chairman. In this role, the Vice President helped make government smaller and more effective, reduce spending, and return power to state and local governments.

In 2013, Vice President Pence left the nation’s capital when Hoosiers elected him the 50th Governor of Indiana. He brought the same limited government and low tax philosophy to the Indiana Statehouse. As Governor, he enacted the largest income tax cut in Indiana history, lowering individual income tax rates, the business personal property tax, and the corporate income tax in order to strengthen the State’s competitive edge and attract new investment and good-paying jobs. Due to his relentless focus on jobs, the state’s unemployment rate fell by half during his four years in office, and at the end of his term, more Hoosiers were working than at any point in the state’s 200-year history.

As Governor of Indiana, Vice President Pence increased school funding, expanded school choice, and created the first state-funded Pre-K plan in Indiana history. He made career and technical education a priority in every high school. Under Vice President Pence’s leadership, Indiana, known as “The Crossroads of America,” invested more than $800 million in new money for roads and bridges across the state. Despite the record tax cuts and new investments in roads and schools, the state remained fiscally responsible, as the Vice President worked with members of the Indiana General Assembly to pass two honestly balanced budgets that left the state with strong reserves and AAA credit ratings that were the envy of the nation.

It was Indiana’s success story, Vice President Pence’s record of legislative and executive experience, and his strong family values that prompted President Trump to select Mike Pence as his running mate in July 2016. They were elected by the American people on November 8, 2016 and entered office on January 20, 2017.

In February 2021, Vice President Mike Pence joined the Heritage Foundation as a distinguished visiting fellow. The Heritage Foundation helped shape Vice President Mike Pence’s conservative philosophy for decades and played a pivotal role advancing conservative policies throughout the Trump Administration. Vice President Pence also joined Young America’s Foundation as the Ronald Reagan Presidential Scholar. Long before Mike Pence became Vice President to President Trump, the vision and leadership of Ronald Reagan inspired his youth.

Vice President Mike Pence remains grateful for the grace of God, the love and support of his family, and the blessings of liberty that are every American’s birthright.

# The American Dream: A Call for New Leadership

The land of opportunity, a beacon of democracy. The shining city on a hill, the land of the free, home of the brave. The United States of America. To sons and daughters of the heartland, and descendants of immigrants, these words are more than just phrases - they represent our American Dream. *We* have lived this dream and, through generations, have experienced the blessings and opportunities this great nation offers.

There has been a great honor to serve in Congress as governor and Vice President to contribute to a stronger, more prosperous America. However, today, our beloved country is facing numerous troubles.

#### The Current State of Affairs

Under the current leadership, the radical left and President Joe Biden have weakened America at home and abroad. This has led to a dire situation for the American Dream:

- **Runaway inflation**: The economy is being crushed under the weight of uncontrollable inflation.
- **Falling wages**: With the ongoing economic uncertainty, wages continue to decrease, making it difficult for citizens to meet their basic needs.
- **Impending recession**: The looming possibility of a recession grows stronger every day, threatening the financial stability of millions of Americans.
- **Southern border crisis**: The southern border has been virtually under siege, as migrants try to enter our country illegally, creating an enormous strain on resources and communities.
- **Global threats**: Our enemies, who seek to undermine freedom and democracy, continue to gain strength and influence worldwide.

Add to these challenges, and our timeless American values are under assault like never before. But we have the resilience and strength to overcome these difficulties. It is time to turn this country around.

#### A Different Leader for Different Times

In this vital period of our history, our party and our nation require a leader who will appeal, as Abraham Lincoln said, to "the better angels of our nature." We must remember the words of the Bible: "To whom much is given, much will be required."

Our families have been blessed with opportunities to serve this nation. It would be easy to remain on the sidelines and observe these turbulent times unfold. However, this is not how we have been raised. With this conviction, one must announce a candidacy for President of the United States of America.

#### A Plan to Revive America

Together, we can revive this great nation. Our path to a brighter future consists of several key actions:

1. **Defend our nation and secure our border**: Strengthen our borders to ensure the security of our citizens and protect our values on a global scale.
2. **Revive our economy**: Implement policies that encourage economic growth and lead the nation back on the path to a balanced budget.
3. **Defend our liberties**: Safeguard the rights granted by the Constitution and preserve the fundamental principles upon which this country was built.
4. **Champion life**: Advocate for the sanctity of human life and the rights of all Americans, from conception to natural death.
5. **Restore our national optimism**: Encourage hope and faith in our country's future, just as President Ronald Reagan once did with his description of "a shining city on the hill."

#### A Renewed Faith in America

Our nation has consistently produced visionary leaders who have called upon us to do hard things. We have always risen to the challenge – and we will rise again. All we need is a government as good, vital, and committed as the people it serves.

We believe in the American people and have faith that we can bring our great country back together. God is not done with America yet. As such, the best days for the greatest nation on earth are still ahead of us.

Let us join together, with renewed enthusiasm, to ensure that the American Dream continues to shine boldly and brightly. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
