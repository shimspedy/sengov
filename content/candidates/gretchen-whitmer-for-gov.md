## Gretchen Whitmer for governor 
Governor Gretchen Whitmer was inaugurated as the 49th governor of Michigan on January 1, 2019. Her career includes serving in the Michigan State House, as the first woman Senate Democratic Leader, and prosecutor for Ingham County, fighting for survivors’ rights and to reform how sexual assault cases are handled. Inspired by her service and family, she is dedicated to improving the lives of all Michiganders.

Gov. Whitmer has been a lifelong resident of Michigan, receiving both a BA and JD from Michigan State University. Prior to serving as governor, she was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives, and later the Michigan Senate. As the Senate Democratic leader, she worked across the aisle to pass Medicaid expansion into law, which now provides affordable health care to more than 750,000 Michiganders. Throughout her career, Gov. Whitmer has worked to ensure that every resident has a great public education, clean drinking water, access to good roads and good-paying jobs.
## Accomplishments
During her tenure, Gov. Whitmer passed a bipartisan budget that closed a $2.2 billion budget deficit that actually increased funding for public education, and she got it done without raising taxes. In her first year in office, Gov. Whitmer worked across the aisle to sign historic auto insurance reform legislation into law, which will protect car accident victims and lower average car insurance rates for Michigan drivers. The governor has also taken bold action to fix Michigan’s crumbling roads through her $3.5 billion Rebuilding Michigan bond plan, which will add 122 major road repair projects to state roads over the next five years without raising taxes.

Governor Whitmer has fought to deliver real progress for Michigan. She has created jobs, led the way for business investment, moved dirt to fix the damn roads, and invested in education. Some of her accomplishments include:

- Every single bill she has signed – over 800 in the last three years – has been bipartisan, and she’s willing to sit down with anyone to solve problems and help people.
- Made the largest investment in K-12 education in state history – without raising taxes, and closed the school funding gap, tripled the number of literacy coaches, and helped reduce class sizes.
- Cut taxes for small business owners and invested over $400 million in local businesses to support and retain jobs.
- Secured $400 refund checks for every Michigan driver, for each car they own, putting money back in the pockets of hardworking Michigan families.
- Created nearly 25,000 auto jobs as part of the biggest manufacturing boom in years, ensuring the future of auto manufacturing will be made in Michigan, by Michigan workers.
- Put 170,000 Michiganders and counting on a path to good-paying jobs with two tuition-free skills training and higher education programs.
- Helped enroll 35,000 four-year-olds in high-quality pre-K and expanded affordable child care to 105,000 more children.
- Moved dirt to fix the damn roads, repairing over 13,000 lane miles and more than 900 bridges, while supporting over 80,000 good paying jobs.
- Turned a projected $3 billion deficit into a $7 billion surplus and passed three balanced budgets without raising taxes.
