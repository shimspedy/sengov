#### Brad Little for governor 
Brad Little is Idaho’s 33rd Governor, leading the people of Idaho through the most prosperous time in state history!
A lifelong conservative, Governor Little’s first term is marked by historic tax relief, unparalleled red tape reduction, extraordinary economic growth, and unprecedented investments in education to ensure a strong workforce for years to come.

Governor Little is committed to continuing to lead Idaho with his goal for Idaho in mind – to make Idaho the place where we all can have the opportunity to thrive, where our children and grandchildren choose to stay, and for the ones who have left to choose to return.


#### Brad Little – Rancher and Family Man

A lifelong rancher and businessman, Brad Little is a third-generation Idahoan with a long family history of public service.

Brad grew up in Emmett working and hunting on the “ranch” ran by his father and started by his grandfather Andy Little, who emigrated to Idaho from Scotland in 1894 and grew the ranch into one of the most well-known sheep operations in the country. Brad learned the values of hard work, perseverance, and faith from his parents and grandparents.

His family also introduced him to the conservative Republican values Brad still holds today. His father was an ardent Republican, a state legislator and one of Idaho’s Republican National Committee members.

One of Brad’s first introductions to politics was campaigning with his father David Little in 1964 and handing out candy with “Goldwater for President” tags on Halloween.

Brad finished his agricultural business degree at the University of Idaho in 1977 and received job offers but chose to return to the ranch instead.

“It was a steep learning curve, and I made a lot of mistakes,” Little concedes, but his innate grasp of the economy – agricultural, state, national, and even global – served him well.

#### Brad Little – Leading Idaho

For more than three decades, Brad Little has taken on leadership roles within the state to promote better opportunities for the Idaho people. His involvements ranged from agriculture to business to education to philanthropy.

Governor Little has a trove of knowledge about Idaho politics and knows how to get things done. He was appointed by then Gov. Dirk Kempthorne to fill a vacancy in the Idaho Senate. He was elected and re-elected to that Senate seat four times, every time with strong support from a large majority of voters. He quickly became a part of the Senate’s leadership team as a Republican Caucus chairman and was recognized nationally for his leadership.

He became Lieutenant Governor in January 2009 when Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter appointed him to a vacancy created by Jim Risch’s move to the U.S. Senate. Little was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014, again with strong support from Idaho voters.

Then, the people of Idaho elected him their 33rd Governor, and he took office on January of 2019.

Now Governor Little is asking for the people’s support again so he can continue to advocate for Idaho’s sovereignty, promote a strong economy, and invest in our workforce.

#### ACCOMPLISHMENTS
During his first term as Governor, Brad Little has already recorded historic achievements when it comes to saving Idahoans more of their hard-earned money, protecting our state’s financial wellbeing, and defending the values Idaho families hold dear.

##### Check out Gov. Brad Little’s top 10 latest accomplishments:

1. Cutting red tape – In just three years, we cut or simplified a whopping 95-percent of Idaho regulations, easing burdens on small businesses and citizens. And we’re going to keep on cutting red tape in the years ahead!

2. Providing historic tax relief and stable budgeting – Gov. Little championed historic tax relief for citizens and businesses in the past few years, with plans to give more money back to the people through continued tax relief. Idaho achieved the AAA credit rating, our rainy-day funds are full, our budget is balanced, and for two years under Gov. Little we have had a record budget surplus!

3. Pushing back on Biden’s overreach – Gov. Little challenged Biden’s unprecedented attempts to invade Americans’ lives with illegal government-imposed vaccine mandates. Governor Little is protecting Idahoans’ God-given rights.

4. Leading on COVID response – Idaho stayed open and provided citizens tax relief while other states went on lockdown. Idaho is one of only a few states with more jobs today than before COVID. Gov. Little never had a mask mandate or vaccine mandate, and he banned vaccine passports. Instead, we responded by adding capacity in healthcare. Idaho’s economy thrives today because we are a top 10 state for the fewest COVID restrictions.

5. Finding solutions to Biden’s border crisis – Idaho faces a growing drug threat because of Biden’s horribly inept handling of the crisis at the border. Gov. Little is leading Idaho toward safety by working with law enforcement and communities in new ways to fight the influence of Mexico drug cartels in our state, and we sent troopers to the border to help our fellow Americans.

6. Back the Blue – While others seek to defund the police, Gov. Little DEFENDS the police. We are backing the blue by supporting law enforcement’s needs and giving them pay raises and bonuses.

7. Supporting Veterans and the Guard – Gov. Little is working to improve the quality of life of our brave veterans with historic investments in veterans homes. He is doubling scholarships for our valuable men and women of the Guard who do so much to protect our country, state, and communities.

8. Supporting parents and education – Gov. Little made historic investments in literacy, education, and workforce training to support our future workforce – our students! We are empowering parents and families with new resources because, after all, PARENTS are in control of their children’s education in Idaho – as it should be.

9. Making investments where they count, without raising taxes – Gov. Little championed historic investments in transportation, water, broadband, agriculture and a number of other areas that impact Idahoans’ daily lives. He did it without raising taxes on people and businesses.

10. Promoting election integrity and freedom – Gov. Little plans for election integrity audits and new resources to protect us against cyber-attacks by bad actors in China, Russia, and elsewhere. Under Gov. Little’s watch, Idaho is a top 10 state for Overall Freedom, Economic Freedom, Regulatory Policy Freedom, Gun Rights, Occupational Freedom, and Health Insurance Freedom.
