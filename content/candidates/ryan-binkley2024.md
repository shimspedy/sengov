#### Ryan Binkley
Ryan Binkley is the President and CEO of Generational Group located in Richardson, Texas. With over 300 employees, Generational focuses on business consultancy, M&A, and wealth advisory for business owners throughout North America.

Ryan and his wife, Ellie, are also founders of Create Church, a multiethnic, multigenerational church in Richardson, Texas. As lead pastor, his deep passion is to see church members of all walks of life discover and live out their purpose.

At Generational, Ryan views business as more than just a means to financial success. It’s a way to serve employees and the community. “We strive to create a culture that respects one another and one that honors God in all that we do.”

Generational gives back to the community through financial support that specifically benefits programs focused on education and multiple veteran charities.

Before starting Generational, Ryan worked in various positions at Procter & Gamble and Boston Scientific Corporation. He holds a BBA from the University of Texas and an MBA from Southern Methodist University.

Ryan and Ellie married in 1999. They have five children in various stages of school and college. They chose to adopt their youngest from South Korea, where Ellie was born before immigrating to the U.S. with her parents. It’s one more way their faith has led them to reach across boundaries, finding unity where others might see differences.

Today, Ryan is leading a new conversation. He is calling America’s leaders to return to the core values of trusting in God and each other again, caring for the hurting, leading with integrity, and bringing hope and healing to our nation.

#### Dedicated To Family

Born in Columbus, Georgia, Ryan and his brother were raised by his parents, John and Sharon Binkley, in Dallas, Plano, and then finally McKinney, Texas where the family bought and renovated a century-old home.

Growing up, Ryan played high school football as a tight-end and linebacker. He got his first job in 5th-grade delivering papers.

From his parents, Ryan learned the importance of hard work, service, and obedience to God. Ryan’s father was a small business owner and salesman who showed his son that if you are faithful in the small things, God will reward you with greater opportunities.

Ryan met his future wife, Ellie, when they worked together in Young Adult ministry. Together, they shared a love of God and a commitment to service. While raising their five (now college-aged) children, Ryan and Ellie have passed on a love of God and community to their children and served together as leaders in business and the faith community across America.

#### Committed To Faithful Service
Ryan Binkley first felt the call to ministry in 1995 while on a mission trip with his church to Guatemala. 

In 1999, soon after they were married, Ryan and Ellie began their life in ministry together, serving as the Directors of the Metro Atlanta Masters Commission at Victory World Church in Norcross, Georgia.

In 2001, after Ryan’s brother was tragically killed in a collision with a drunk driver, they felt God’s call to return to Ryan’s hometown of Dallas to help with his family’s business and begin a new ministry.

From 2009 to 2012, Ryan and Ellie served as elders and pastors at Covenant Church’s College and Career Ministry. Today, they serve as Lead Pastors of the ministry they founded, Create Church, which is dedicated to helping “people find and fulfill their created purpose in Christ.”

#### Driven To Innovate
Ryan Binkley graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with his Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration and a passion for entrepreneurship. He went to work in the consumer products industry with Procter and Gamble, services with Boston Scientific Corporation, and technology consulting in the private sector. 

After returning to the Dallas area to help run his family’s business after his brother’s untimely death, Ryan earned his Master’s Degree in Business Administration from the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University.

In 2005, he launched the company that would become Generational Group, where he currently serves as President & CEO, providing leadership for the strategic direction of the company and managing the Capital Services, Valuation, and Advisory teams as they work directly with Generational Equity clients through the transaction process.

Under Binkley’s leadership, Generational Group, recognized as the North America Investment Bank of the Year by the M&A Advisor in 2022, guides business owners on how to grow and sell their companies even in difficult times. He believes similar strategies can be applied to the future of our country and economy.

#### THE BORDER SECURITY AND DIGNITY PLAN

The Department of Homeland Security protects the American homeland from and prepares for terrorism and other hazards in both the physical and cyber realms, provides for secure and free movement of trade and travel, and enforces U.S. immigration laws impartially.

Background:
To truly secure the homeland, a conservative Administration needs to return the department to the right mission, the right size, and the right budget. This would include reorganizing the department and shifting significant resources away from several supporting components to the essential operational components. Prioritizing border security and immigration enforcement, including detention and deportation, is critical if we are regain control of the border, repair the historic damage done by the Biden Administration, return to a lawful and orderly immigration system, and protect the homeland from terrorism and public safety threats. This also includes consolidating the pieces of the fragmented immigration system into one agency to fulfill the mission more efficiently.

The Binkley Administration DHS will:
1. Secure and control the border to end human, drug, and weapons trafficking
2. Thoroughly enforce immigration laws
3. Correctly and efficiently adjudicate immigration benefit applications while rejecting fraudulent claims

#### 7-YEAR ECONOMIC RESCUE PLAN

The recent downgrade of the U.S. government by Fitch Ratings is a wake-up call that our current runaway spending and broken budget process cannot continue.  Our fiscal system is headed toward a crisis; we need a President who has the courage to set a new path.  

I’ve put together a plan to attack the deficit and bring the budget back into balance in 7 years. Moreover,  transparency and accountability must be restored to the way that Washington spends taxpayers’ money.  

First, I’ll warn you right now, many critics – including many Republicans and likely some of my opponents in this primary – are going to say that trying to balance the federal budget in 7 years is, “too much, too fast.”

Let me remind you that those are the same people who watched the deficit more than double over the past 7 years from $620 billion to $1.375 trillion. 

According to the U.S. Treasury, spending in FY 2023, through June, was 10 percent higher than in 2022.  That’s another $455 billion, and the fiscal year isn’t over yet.  

When is Washington’s out of control spending going to stop?  When will our federal government’s excessive borrowing get under control?

#### RESTORING UNITY

That is the word Americans use most often to describe our country. So, it’s no surprise that more than 75% of Americans say they are “dissatisfied” with the direction of our nation.

Something has to change.

Every great thing we’ve accomplished as a nation, we’ve done together. Whether it was securing our independence, defeating fascism, landing on the moon, or advancing human knowledge, we triumphed because we stood shoulder to shoulder.

Now, we seem hopelessly broken. 

Our leaders have brought us to a place of division and paralysis by convincing us that we have more to fear from each other than anything else.

No American is our enemy simply because they disagree with us–even when they’re wrong.

The problems we face, and the blame we lay, can all be rectified if we look to God, find the good in our fellow Americans, and resolve to trust each other one more time. 

I think we can all agree that we will not always agree. But what we can do is focus on those things that bring us together instead of those that tear us apart. That’s the way to freedom.

MY GOALS
- SEEK BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS
- ENCOURAGE COMPROMISE AND COOPERATION
- CONFRONT THE RACIAL, CULTURAL, SPIRITUAL, AND ECONOMIC DIVIDES IN OUR NATION

#### TRANSFORMING HEALTHCARE

Over the last 20 years, healthcare inflation has outpaced regular inflation by 40%.

Insurance companies and hospitals work hand-in-hand, creating a virtual monopoly that drives costs through the roof while taking away your choices and power.

They use their money and influence to convince us all that healthcare is too complicated for us to understand.

That’s why healthcare is the only major expense most Americans accept without knowing what we’re getting, how much it costs, what the alternatives are, and if it will even work.

We can end the healthcare monopoly and put patients back in charge by promoting transparency and real competition.

Hospitals and insurance companies should have to compete for your business, not the other way around, and you should be able to shop for the best insurance, medicine, and care without worrying about state borders.


MY GOALS
- EMPOWER PATIENTS AND EXPAND THEIR OPTIONS
- IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND INCREASE COMPETITION
- GET HEALTHCARE INFLATION UNDER CONTROL

#### CLIMATE
Our focus should not be on climate policies that cost a lot, deliver little, and in the end likely don’t even work. Rather, we should focus our efforts on developing new technology and encouraging innovation that will lead to the production of affordable and dependable green energy.

It is possible for us to have a sensible climate policy without breaking the bank and without sacrificing the amazing opportunities delivered by cheap and abundant energy.

The best investment governments can make is in innovative climate and energy technology. That is how human beings have solved problems around the world throughout history. Humans have a wonderful ability to adapt to circumstances, and we should include that in the climate conversation. The lesson to be drawn is that if a country wants to reduce the number of its citizens dying as a result of climate, it should pursue economic and technological development.

MY GOALS
- The U.S. must lead on nuclear energy. There are 57 nuclear power reactors under construction worldwide right now — but only one in the United States.
- We must fix our broken energy permitting system. 80 percent of emissions reductions promised by the Inflation Reduction Act won't come to pass if we do not modernize our permitting system and let America build.
- We must onshore or "friend-shore" rare earth elements and critical mineral mining and processing. Minerals such as cobalt and lithium, are key to making technologies like EVs and wind turbines. China produces 60% of rare earth elements (but refines 90% of them) and refines 60-70% of lithium and cobalt.

#### ACHIEVING ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
America should never depend on foreign nations for our energy, especially those nations who fear and oppose our way of life.

God granted us this rich and bountiful land that already has everything we require to meet our energy needs.

By investing in homegrown and produced energy, we will create family-supporting jobs, reduce energy costs for working Americans, and break the stranglehold that nations like Russia have on the world’s economy.

To do this, we must adopt a national “All Of The Above” energy strategy that includes oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, biofuels, and emerging technologies.

MY GOALS
- MAKE AMERICA A NET-EXPORTER OF ENERGY
- EXPAND THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER
- PROMOTE AMERICA-GROWN BIOFUELS
- RESPONSIBLY EXPAND THE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICA’S OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND COAL

#### SECURING THE BORDER, SOLVING IMMIGRATION
Politicians in Washington have promised to solve the immigration and border crises for decades.

Yet, our southern border is still overrun with drug peddlers, criminals, and human traffickers, while millions of people live here with no legal status.

It’s time to stop talking about these problems and get down to the hard work of actually fixing them.

The simple truth is that we will never be able to fix our immigration system until we secure our border. However, our border will never be truly secure as long as our immigration system encourages and rewards lawbreaking.

We have to find a way to solve both at virtually the same time.

Unfortunately, our leaders don’t want to make the hard choices needed to accomplish that.

We need an immigration system that secures the border, identifies and removes dangerous illegal immigrants, and provides a realistic, compassionate, and effective solution for the millions of undocumented families who are already here.

It’s time to bring the people living in our nation illegally out of the shadows by providing them with a realistic path to legal status. They won’t jump to the front of the line, but it’s time to give them a place in that line.

That’s the only way to know who is in our nation while also stopping the flow of drugs, violence, and human misery across our southern border.

MY GOALS
- BUILD A PHYSICAL BARRIER TO HELP SECURE THE SOUTHERN BORDER
- PROVIDE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO BORDER ENFORCEMENT
- STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM
- IDENTIFY AND REMOVE DANGEROUS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
- PROVIDE A PERMANENT PROCESS TO RESOLVE THE STATUS OF UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES

#### KEEPING AMERICA STRONG AND SAFE
Across the globe, the enemies of freedom are flexing their power.

Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine, China’s increasingly aggressive imperialism, and the continued provocations from North Korea demonstrate the fragile state of our national security.
The way to freedom is an America that is proud and secure in its place in the world, unflinching in the face of tyranny, slow to anger, quick to aid its allies, but always willing to extend the hand of diplomacy to anyone who will take it in good faith.

Peace will always be our goal, but never at the cost of our liberty, independence, or sovereignty.


MY GOALS
- ENSURE AMERICA MAINTAINS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MILITARY IN THE WORLD
- STRENGTHEN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY ALLIES
- CONFRONT CHINA’S EXPANSIONISM IN ASIA AND AFRICA
- DEFEND FREEDOM-LOVING NATIONS
- HOLD AGGRESSORS LIKE RUSSIA ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS

#### REVITALIZING URBAN AMERICA
America is facing two crises that, at first glance, seem unrelated; the decay of urban communities and the apathy of our youth.

But they are connected. We address both problems with one solution – a new national movement of volunteerism. We’ll encourage, motivate, and equip America’s youth to take ownership of their communities and make a real difference in the lives of people who are hurting and in need.

I propose we start a volunteer movement in our country that would rival the Peace Corps and bring life, education, and mentorship into our urban communities and schools.

MY GOALS
- STRENGTHEN EDUCATION AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN AMERICA’S CITIES
- ENCOURAGE A NEW SPIRIT OF CIVIC DUTY IN AMERICA’S YOUTH
- REDUCE POVERTY, VIOLENCE, AND DESPAIR IN URBAN AREAS WITHOUT GROWING GOVERNMENT

#### PROMOTING A CULTURE OF LIFE
I’m proudly pro-life, and I believe that every life matters. I was thankful when the court overturned Roe v. Wade because I believe in the worth and value of every human life.

However, when we talk about being pro-life, the children in foster care are often left out of the conversation.

Being pro-life means recognizing that every life matters and has a God-given purpose.

My wife and I were blessed with four biological children, and we jumped at the chance to adopt another child who has added so much to our family.

My heart breaks for hundreds of thousands of unborn children who lost their lives to abortion last year, but it also breaks for the hundreds of thousands of kids without a real home.

There are over 200,000 American children stuck in the foster care system. Many of them will never have a permanent home. It’s time to create a culture of adoption in this country that gives every American child a chance at a stable, loving family.

It’s time to build a culture of life and adoption in this country so every American child can experience the love and comfort of family.


MY GOALS
- PROTECT THE UNBORN
- MAKE ADOPTION EASIER AND MORE AFFORDABLE
- TRANSFORM AMERICA’S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM

#### STRONG & BOLD GLOBAL LEADERSHIP
Our focus should be on reinvigorating our military. Our citizens need and want to feel safe. We need to build a formidable military, where strength will be our most effective deterrent.

By bolstering recruitment efforts, reemphasizing military might and toughness, and continuing to invest in the development of state-of-the-art equipment and weapons, we will once again have a military that can effectively keep our adversaries in check.

We must show strength and boldness with every action, investment, and statement we make, as our adversaries will pounce on any signs of vulnerability.


MY GOALS
- ALL NATO ALLIES MUST COMMIT AT LEAST 2% OF THEIR GDP ON MILITARY SPENDING.
- DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP IRAN FROM DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPON CAPABILITIES.
- BUILD ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC TIES IN AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA, WHERE CHINA IS CURRENTLY MAKING SIGNIFICANT INROADS.
- CONTINUE DIPLOMACY & JOINT DEFENSE EXERCISES WITH OUR ALLIES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA REGION AS A DETERRENT TO AN INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE CHINA.
- NURTURE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL, OUR MOST TRUSTED ALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
- FOCUS ON DIPLOMACY TO END THE UKRAINE/RUSSIA WAR AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
