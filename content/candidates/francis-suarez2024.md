Francis X. Suarez, the 43rd Mayor of Miami and a true Miami native, is dedicated to shaping a Miami that endures for generations to come and is open to all. Mayor Suarez first came into office with an impressive mandate of 86 percent support and was subsequently re-elected with nearly 79 percent backing from the community. Throughout his tenure, he has been a strong advocate for integrating climate adaptive policies, Web 3.0 technology, and a free-market approach into all aspects of government as part of his visionary Miami Forever Agenda.

Under his leadership, Miami has seen significant reductions in both crime rates and taxes, reaching levels not seen in over half a century. This has spurred a robust and widespread economic expansion across the city. Mayor Suarez has also championed a series of affordable housing reforms under the banner of "Miami For-Everyone." These reforms leverage federal opportunity zones and the activation of underutilized land to increase the supply and accessibility of affordable housing for working individuals and communities of color.

Most notably, Mayor Suarez has been at the forefront of fostering Miami's burgeoning tech economy through initiatives like Venture Miami. These efforts connect education and job training to Miami's emerging economic sectors, including Fintech, Medtech, and Greentech. Drawing inspiration from his father, former Miami Mayor Xavier L. Suarez, Mayor Suarez emphasizes inclusive and servant leadership to drive economic prosperity, personal opportunity, fairness, equal rights, and reconciliation for all residents.

Mayor Suarez holds a bachelor's degree in finance from Florida International University, where he graduated in the top ten percent of his class. He furthered his education by earning a law degree from the University of Florida Levin College of Law, graduating cum laude. Mayor Suarez's accomplishments have not gone unnoticed, as he has been selected as an Aspen Institute Rodel Fellow and named a Time Future 100 Leader. Forbes has recognized him as the 20th Greatest Leader in the World, a testament to his impactful leadership.

Currently serving as the President of the US Conference of Mayors, Mayor Suarez also practices law as Of Counsel for Quinn Emmanuel LLP, a renowned international law firm. He is happily married to Gloria Fonts Suarez, and together, they have a son, Andrew Xavier, and a daughter, Gloriana Pilar. They share a profound love for Miami and consider themselves fortunate to raise their family in the vibrant Magic City.

Mayor Suarez's early years were shaped by his family's commitment to social consciousness and public service. As the son of former City of Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, he grew up in an environment where civic engagement was the norm, spending his formative years around his father's office at City Hallâ€”an office he now occupies.

In summary, Francis X. Suarez brings a wealth of experience, dedication, and a forward-thinking approach to his leadership. He envisions a Miami that thrives economically, environmentally, and socially, and his track record demonstrates his commitment to realizing this vision.
