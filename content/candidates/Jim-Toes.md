Jim Toes is seeking the Republican Party’s nomination for New York’s 3rd Congressional District.

Born in Levittown, raised in Melville and today a 30-year resident of Manhasset, Jim Toes has lived almost his entire life in New York’s 3rd congressional district. Jim and his wife of 34 years, Jeanine, have four wonderful adult children, all of whom graduated public high school. Jim is the youngest of seven siblings. His father was a New York City Police Captain who instilled in him the values of honesty and hard work and a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable. He was blessed with a mother who filled the home with unconditional love and a strong faith built upon service to others.

Jim experienced a quintessential 1970s childhood on Long Island, with open spaces and clean waterways. He went on to graduate from Fordham University in the Bronx, N.Y. with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.

Jim is currently the President & CEO of the Security Traders Association (“STA”), a grassroots organization serving individuals employed in the financial services industry with affiliates in 20 North American cities. In this role, Jim maintains relationships with U.S. regulators and congressional policymakers on both sides of the aisle, advocating for financial markets structured around free-market capitalism, competition and investor protection.

Prior to joining STA, Jim was a Managing Director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch for 18 years, where he held various management positions and interacted with a broad range of clients, including institutional and middle-market asset managers, broker-dealers and retail investors. In total, Jim has nearly 35 years of experience in the securities industry, particularly within equity and options sales, trading and clearing, as well as legislation and regulation. He is eager to take these skills to Washington, DC in service to New York’s 3rd congressional district.

From his personal life experience, Jim believes that the primary role of government is to protect its citizens and their property. Jim believes the U.S. Constitution is the greatest political document that has ever been written. He is an optimist who firmly believes there is no problem that the American people cannot solve, and he agrees with Mark Twain that “patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.” 

Informed by his career in the private sector, Jim believes that the combination of free-market capitalism and efficient government regulation is the best system for lifting people out of poverty and fostering an economy that encourages job creation, empowers small businesses and attracts investment. His extensive travels to cities throughout North America have taught him what the results of government policies – both good and bad – look like for those they impact.

Jim is a life-long Republican and a political outsider with hands-on experience dealing with our federal government on national issues. He brings a fresh voice and a well-informed perspective. He believes it is time for an approach to politics that embraces collaboration and seeks common ground to drive progress.

Jim loves our country and Long Island – and he doesn’t want to move to Florida. With your support, Jim will work tirelessly to make sure NY-03 and all of Nassau County remains the iconic haven that it has been to us and will be for future generations to come.


#### Energy
Our nation’s national security and economic well-being require reliable forms of energy. Jim believes that the federal government should not be picking winners and losers when it comes to various forms of energy. The United States should instead adopt an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that includes a long-term, multifaceted approach to address the current status of high energy prices and the lack of energy independence.

A comprehensive energy package that increases energy independence and encourages the development of alternative and renewable energy sources would ensure that we are providing energy solutions without placing America at a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world.

#### Fentanyl Poisoning Crisis
The fentanyl poisoning crisis is a tragedy of epic proportion and a national security threat that requires a wholistic and highly coordinated response from our government – starting with stricter border security. If elected to congress Jim will use his knowledge of how the financial markets operate to support legislation such as the Stop Fentanyl Money Laundering Act which seeks to shut down the sophisticated money laundering schemes used by those organizations and individuals involved in the production and distribution of illegal fentanyl

#### Immigration
Jim believes that the country should be welcoming for those who go through the immigration process to obtain legal residency. While it is true that America is a nation of immigrants, it is also a nation of laws. Illegal immigration is a serious problem in the United States, it stresses infrastructure and programs designed to support American citizens in particular those who are homeless and attending public elementary and secondary schools.

Additionally, many cities across the nation, including New York City, have enacted official sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants or have been refusing to comply with detainer requests from the Department of Homeland Security. Sanctuary cities create a dangerous environment for citizens and law enforcement. When in Congress, Jim will support efforts which strengthen our border security; curtail the flow of illegal immigrants into our country and defund cities with sanctuary policies.

#### Inflation And Economic Growth
Historic levels of inflation are taxing middle-class families and hurting small businesses across Long Island. Whether at the grocery store or the gas pump, rising prices are holding families back from economic security.

As a child in the 1970’s with a Father on a fixed-income and now as a parent with four children, Jim has experienced the stress and fear inflation brings to households. When serving in Congress, ending this historic inflation will be top a priority. Here are some of the steps we must take to do so:

- Enact pro-growth tax and regulatory policies.
- End the spending sprees in Washington that is devaluing the dollar and prolonging the inflation crisis.
- Unleash American energy producers to make America energy dominant again
- Normalize monetary policy

#### Federal Spending
The recent downgrade on U.S. government debt by Fitch Ratings needs to be a wake-up call for greater fiscal responsibility. As of August 1st, the U.S. Treasury owed $32.6 trillion to bondholders while its budgetary deficit exceeds $1 trillion. By most any measurement: debt as percentage of GDP; the amount of debt per capita or debt per taxpayer the continued deficit spending by government is a burden to future generations. As a member of Congress Jim will support policies which get our nation on a path towards fiscal responsibility.

#### Affordability In NY-03
The cost of living in New York’s 3rd Congressional district is unnecessarily high due to rising inflation and government policies. Whether you drive to work or take the LIRR, your commuting costs have gone up dramatically due to the high cost of gasoline, increases to existing tolls and train fares and now new fees associated with the MTA’s congestion pricing program. As a member of Congress Jim will support policies which lower the cost of energy, will push back on fare increases and new fees, while also working on a bipartisan basis to restore the State and Local Tax (“SALT”) deduction.

#### Stock Trading In Washington DC
Occurrences or appearances of insider trading erode the public trust in government and undermine our democracy by destroying the reputations of the government and its institutions. As a former stock trader at a premier financial firm Jim understand the policies and surveillance to detect trading on material non-public information. Jim is well qualified to recognize this nefarious behavior and as a member of Congress will work on a bipartisan basis to craft thoughtful and effective legislation which will instill public trust that government officials who are privy to material and non-public information will not use that knowledge to benefit themselves at our expense.
