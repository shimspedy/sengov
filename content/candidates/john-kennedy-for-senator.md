## A Little Bit About John Kennedy
John Kennedy was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. Sen. Kennedy serves on the Appropriations, Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Budget, Judiciary and Small Business and Entrepreneurship committees in the U.S. Senate. He serves as the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee of Energy and Water Development for the Appropriations Committee, the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee of Federal Courts for the Judiciary Committee, and the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee of Economic Policy for the Banking Committee.

## Louisiana Values
Before he became Senator in 2017, John Kennedy was elected to five terms as State Treasurer. As Treasurer, he oversaw the state’s $10.6 billion investment portfolios. He also oversaw local and state bond issues and returned millions of dollars in unclaimed property each year. Prior to his position as Treasurer, John served as Secretary of the Department of Revenue, Special Counsel to Governor Roemer and Secretary of Governor Roemer’s Cabinet. He was also an attorney and partner in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans law firm of Chaffe McCall.

John was raised in Zachary, LA. and graduated from Zachary High School. John graduated magna cum laude in political science, philosophy and economics from Vanderbilt, was president of his senior class, and elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He received his law degree from the University of Virginia and his B.C.L. degree from Oxford University in England where he was a First Class Honors graduate. John has been an adjunct professor at LSU Law School and has been a volunteer substitute teacher for Louisiana public schools for over 15 years.

He resides in Madisonville, Louisiana, with his wife Becky and their son, Preston. They are founding members of the North Cross United Methodist Church.

## Committed to Conservatives

Senator Kennedy is a true champion of conservative values and our constitutional rights. He believes that America is the greatest nation in all human history and that our freedoms must always be defended. As senator, he has fought to lower taxes, protect your 2nd Amendment rights, secure the Southern border, and defend the lives of the unborn.


## John Kennedy's Priorities
Serving as U.S. Senator for the great state of Louisiana has been the honor of my lifetime. I know how important it is to fight for your interests and not the interests of the Washington elite. We need good-paying jobs, better education for our children, and a little common sense up in Washington, and I’m working every day to make sure it happens.

## Fighting Inflation
Washington spending has driven inflation to its highest point in 40 years, I am fighting these reckless policies like a hound from hell. Louisianians are feeling the pinch of higher prices at the grocery store, at the gas pump, and in their electric bills. I’ve been doing everything I can to bring down costs, take the handcuffs off America’s oil and gas industry, and stop inflation. That’s why I have opposed more than $13 trillion in wasteful government spending, why I’ve fought to regain American energy independence, and why I will continue to oppose policies that will increase inflation and add to our debt.

## Putting America First
America is the greatest nation in all human history. But you wouldn’t know that listening to the liberal politicians these days. As your U.S. Senator, I’ve always put America’s interests first, including standing up to communist China and ending the bad trade deals that hurt our American workers.

## Standing up for Louisiana Families
I’ve voted to put more money back in Louisiana families’ pocketbooks, supported policies that keep neighbors safe from violent criminals, keep insurance premiums low, protect the family retirement plan from foreign corruption, and even keep the family dog safe during travel.

## Bringing Louisiana Common Sense to Washington
Louisianians are busy earning a living every day and providing for their families. They don’t have time to worry about the partisan games that seem to be played every day in Washington. That’s why I am fighting on the front lines against stupid each and every day. I’ve often said our country was founded by geniuses, but it’s being run by idiots. It’s true. When the left wingers introduce liberal policies like the Green New Deal or Welfare For All, I am always there to fight back. I’ve stood strong to stop our tax dollars from going to dead people, to stop millionaires from collecting food stamps, and to stop violent murderers and pedophiles from receiving get-out-of-jail-free cards. I will never back down from a fight over wasteful spending or wacky policy ideas. You trusted me to bring Louisiana common sense to every debate in the U.S. Senate, and that’s what I do.

## Protecting Louisiana Jobs
Whether it’s oil and gas, a small business down Main Street, working at a petrochemical plant, or a start-up lawn mowing company, I am fighting to create new jobs and provide specialized training to Louisiana’s workers. I’ve lowered taxes for working families and cut job-killing red tape because I believe you should keep more of your hard-earned money, not the government.

## Draining the Swamp
In Washington, millions of dollars are made each year through illegal means. I’ve acted to uncover illegal insider stock trading, corrupt federal contracting, and saved more than $80 billion for the U.S. taxpayers. Cracking down on corruption is essential to building a democracy we can trust, and I will always prioritize ways to save taxpayer money.

## Build the Wall, Secure the Border
We need to finish building the border wall, plain and simple. While liberals in the White House and Congress champion open borders, Louisianians favor policies that secure our Southern border. That’s because what happens at the border affects us. We don’t want crime in our communities perpetrated by drug cartels who peddle drugs and violence. I helped lead efforts to build a secure border wall to stop the inflow of illegal aliens, drugs, and violence, and have fought to stop our taxpayer dollars from funding sanctuary cities like San Francisco. I’ve prioritized funding for law enforcement agencies to keep our communities safe and worked to criminalize visa overstays and end the practice of a visa lottery. America is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws, and Washington needs to start acting like it.

## Protecting Life
I believe that every life is precious, whether it’s 82-years-old or 82-seconds-old. I’m pro-life, and I don’t believe that California and New York get to tell Louisianians what our laws or values should be. That choice belongs to the good people of Louisiana.

## Lowering Energy Prices
The Democrats’ anti-oil-and-gas agenda is driving our energy prices through the roof. That kills Louisiana jobs and hurts Louisiana families. I am working hard to bring back America’s energy independence by unleashing Louisiana’s oil and gas production. It’s simple: We can lower energy and gas prices by increasing the supply of sustainable, affordable energy.

## Flood Insurance & Disaster Recovery
Many Louisiana families count on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for affordable flood insurance to protect their biggest assets—their homes. I’ve fought tooth and nail to keep NFIP rates low and have repeatedly passed laws that saved the program from lapsing. I have personally helped secure $20 billion in disaster relief for the people of Louisiana to recover from historic flooding as well as from Hurricanes Laura, Ida, and Delta. I’ll continue battling to reauthorize flood insurance while supporting reforms that keep Louisiana premiums low. When natural disasters strike, I fight like hell to get the assistance and accountability from federal agencies that disaster victims deserve. No one should face rebuilding alone.

## Keeping Louisiana Communities Safe
When Washington elites treat police officers like criminals and criminals like victims, crime rates rise. I’ve consistently supported law enforcement and opposed radical demands to defund and disrespect the police. I voted against legislation that would release violent offenders from jail early. I’ve supported common sense reforms to reduce violent crime by getting dangerous predators off our streets and away from innocent victims. As we’ve seen, one of the best ways to combat crime is ensuring that law-abiding citizens can defend themselves. That’s why I’ve supported the Second Amendment at every turn and protected the right of my fellow Louisianians to bear arms. The open border has also allowed criminal gangs and deadly drugs to flood into our country. I’ve visited the U.S.-Mexico border myself, and it’s clear that we must secure that border if we’re going to make our communities safe again. I won’t stop battling to make that happen.

## Life-changing Education
Education has the power to change lives. No parent should have to send his or her child to a failing school. Too many of our kids are trapped in schools where violence is more common than learning.

I’ve been a substitute teacher in Louisiana public schools for years, so I’ve seen firsthand that quality education is the key to Louisiana’s future. Improving our education system starts with getting the federal government out of our curriculum and classrooms and with giving teachers the resources and authority they need to do their jobs. Just ask a parent, what we are teaching our kids matters, and I refuse to support Biden’s plan to subsidize wokeness in Louisiana’s schools. The most important thing we can do to improve our schools is make sure parents have the authority and power they need to make good decisions for their child’s future, and I’m working every day to make sure they have that.
