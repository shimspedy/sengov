Marianne Williamson is a visionary leader, a bestselling author, and a spiritual teacher who is running for president in 2024 as an independent candidate. She believes that America needs a radical transformation that goes beyond politics and addresses the spiritual and moral dimensions of our national crisis.

Marianne was born and raised in Houston, Texas, in a Jewish family. She graduated from Pomona College in California, and then moved to New York City, where she discovered A Course in Miracles, a self-study program of spiritual psychology. She started teaching the course in 1983, and soon became a popular and influential speaker. She also founded Project Angel Food, a nonprofit organization that delivers meals to people with life-threatening illnesses.

Marianne has written 14 books, including four that reached #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. Her most famous book, A Return to Love, was published in 1992 and sold over 3 million copies. She has also appeared on numerous television shows, such as The Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning America, and The View. She has been called “one of the most influential spiritual leaders of our time” by Time magazine.

Marianne first entered politics in 2014, when she ran for Congress in California’s 33rd district. She finished fourth in the primary, with 13% of the vote. She then launched her presidential campaign in 2019, with the slogan “Join the Evolution”. She advocated for a “politics of love” that would address the root causes of the problems facing the nation and the world. She proposed policies such as creating a Department of Peace, establishing a universal basic income, canceling student debt, and reparations for slavery.

Marianne qualified for the first two Democratic debates in 2019, where she attracted attention for her unconventional and charismatic style. She also gained a loyal fan base, especially among young people and celebrities. However, she failed to meet the criteria for the subsequent debates, and dropped out of the race in January 2020. She endorsed Bernie Sanders for the nomination, but later expressed disappointment with the Democratic Party and the media for their treatment of her and other progressive candidates.

Marianne announced her second presidential bid in 2023, saying that she felt “a moral obligation” to run again. She said that she wanted to offer a “radical alternative” to the status quo, and to inspire a “spiritual awakening” in the country. She said that she would run as an independent, and that she would not accept any donations from corporations or PACs. She also said that she would focus on grassroots organizing and social media, and that she would rely on her supporters to spread her message.

Marianne Williamson has a bold and visionary platform that aims to transform America from a politics of fear to a politics of love. She believes that we need to address not only the symptoms, but also the underlying causes of our national and global challenges. She proposes solutions that are rooted in a holistic and integrative perspective, that honor the dignity and potential of every human being, and that respect the interdependence and balance of all life.

Marianne's platform covers a wide range of issues, such as:

- **Peace**: Marianne wants to create a Department of Peace, a cabinet-level agency that would coordinate and support peace-building efforts at home and abroad. She also wants to reduce military spending, end endless wars, and promote diplomacy and cooperation. She supports a nuclear-free world, a ban on weapons sales to human rights violators, and a global commitment to nonviolence.

- **Justice**: Marianne wants to heal the wounds of the past and the present, and to create a more just and equitable society for all. She supports reparations for slavery, a truth and reconciliation commission for Native Americans, and a comprehensive immigration reform. She also supports criminal justice reform, voting rights protection, LGBTQ+ rights, and disability rights.

- **Democracy**: Marianne wants to restore the power of the people and the integrity of our democracy. She supports overturning Citizens United, ending gerrymandering, abolishing the Electoral College, and expanding public financing of elections. She also supports statehood for Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, and a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 16.

- **Economy**: Marianne wants to create a more inclusive and sustainable economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful. She supports a universal basic income, a federal jobs guarantee, a living wage, and a wealth tax. She also supports canceling student debt, expanding Social Security, and strengthening antitrust laws.

- **Health**: Marianne wants to ensure that everyone has access to quality, affordable, and comprehensive health care. She supports Medicare for All, a single-payer system that would cover all essential services, including mental health, dental health, and vision care. She also supports a holistic approach to health, that includes prevention, wellness, and alternative therapies.

- **Education**: Marianne wants to provide every child with the opportunity to learn and grow in a nurturing and stimulating environment. She supports universal pre-K, free public college, and student loan forgiveness. She also supports investing in STEM education, arts education, and bilingual education. She also supports ending high-stakes testing, increasing teacher pay, and reducing class sizes.

- **Environment**: Marianne wants to address the climate crisis and protect the environment for future generations. She supports the Green New Deal, a bold and comprehensive plan to transition the U.S. to a clean energy economy and create millions of green jobs. She also supports rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, banning fracking, and phasing out fossil fuels.

- **Spirituality**: Marianne wants to inspire a spiritual awakening in the country and the world, that would foster a deeper sense of connection, compassion, and purpose. She supports the separation of church and state, but also the integration of spirituality and politics. She believes that we need to cultivate a moral and ethical framework that guides our actions and decisions, and that reflects our highest values and ideals.
