#### Jared Polis for governor 
Governor Polis is a hard-working Coloradan who has run successful businesses, delivered better education opportunities for our kids and is now serving as Colorado’s 43rd Governor. Under his leadership, Colorado is working to become one of the most family-friendly states while topping the list of strongest state economies in the country.

Since taking office in 2019, Governor Polis has delivered on the top priorities he committed to tackle for Colordans – lowering the cost of childcare and getting more kids in free, full-day kindergarten, reducing the cost of healthcare, accelerating our fight against climate change and lowering taxes for hard-working families.

As an entrepreneur and businessman, Governor Polis knows what it takes to create jobs and make payroll. By the time he was 30, he’d launched three successful companies, including ProFlowers, one of the world’s leading online flower retailers.

Following the Governor’s business successes, he worked to make sure other Coloradans had the opportunity to pursue their dreams. He co-founded Techstars, a startup accelerator that mentors entrepreneurs, and Patriot Boot Camp, which helps veterans start their own small businesses.

Governor Polis has spent his career fighting for higher-quality schools and education for our kids. He served six years on the Colorado Board of Education, where he worked to raise pay for teachers and reduce class size for students. He also opened schools to support at-risk kids in Colorado.

He has continued that work as Governor, setting Colorado on a path to make the biggest investment in K-12 education in Colorado’s history and making good on his commitment to giving every single one of our youngest students a great start. Today, because of Governor Polis, Colorado offers free universal, full-day kindergarten and, beginning next year, free preschool for every child — saving families thousands of dollars per year.

Governor Polis also served as the U.S. representative for Colorado’s Second Congressional District for a decade. The Center for Effective Lawmaking ranked Polis the most effective member of Colorado’s House delegation due to his success working across the aisle to improve Colorado’s schools, protect public lands, and support startups and small businesses.

As our Governor, Polis has kept Colorado moving forward — delivering on his commitments while leading our communities through challenges and tragedies our state has never seen before. He knows it’s more important than ever to save people money and help all families share in the amazing Colorado way of life. And he knows that Colorado’s best days are still ahead.
