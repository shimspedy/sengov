#### Meet Ron DeSantis

Ron DeSantis, a native Floridian with blue-collar roots, grew up in Dunedin under the care of his nurse mother and cable box installer father. He attended Dunedin High School before earning his way through Yale University, where he served as captain of the varsity baseball team. Ron's dedication to education continued as he graduated with honors from Harvard Law School and earned a commission as a JAG officer in the U.S. Navy.

During his active-duty service, Ron deployed to Iraq, supporting SEAL missions in Fallujah, Ramadi, and Al Anbar province. He received military honors, including the Bronze Star Medal for Meritorious Service and the Iraq Campaign Medal. Ron's commitment to justice led him to serve as a prosecutor in Florida, where he successfully put child predators behind bars.

In 2012, Ron was elected to Congress, focusing on government accountability, advocating for term limits, and a balanced budget amendment. During his time in Congress, he fought against the weaponization of the IRS and exposed the falsehoods behind the "Russia collusion" conspiracy theory. As a veteran himself, Ron became a strong advocate for fellow servicemen and women, pushing for reforms in the VA and expanded support for mental health.

In 2018, Ron DeSantis became the 46th Governor of Florida, fighting for the rights of the people he represents and fearlessly standing up for freedom. Throughout the challenging times of 2020, when the establishment, bureaucracy, and corporate media pushed for lockdowns and mandates, Governor DeSantis unwaveringly defended liberty.

Grounded in America's founding principles, Governor DeSantis transformed Florida into a model for the nation's revival. He achieved numerous conservative victories, including saving jobs from job-killing lockdowns and vaccine mandates, protecting citizens from the negative effects of the border crisis, defending parental rights, and eliminating critical race theory. Governor DeSantis took action against woke power grabs, championed medical freedom, ensured election integrity, protected the unborn, and supported the Second Amendment rights of Floridians. His administration also focused on education freedom, accountable governance, affordable prescription drugs, and supporting law enforcement and veterans.

Governor DeSantis's leadership and conservative policy achievements led to a resounding victory in the 2022 election, earning him a second term by the largest raw vote margin in Florida's history. His success extended beyond expectations, flipping traditionally Democratic counties like Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. He gained significant support from Independents, Hispanics, and women compared to his first election.

Governor DeSantis's relentless pursuit of common sense and unwavering commitment to freedom have made Florida a haven for families. Under his leadership, Floridians enjoy low taxes, quality education, and protection against federal overreach and ideological coercion. His vision has resulted in historic conservative policy wins, including tax relief, ESG prohibitions, measures countering the influence of the CCP, strong medical freedom protections, transparent medication pricing, higher education reforms, infrastructure improvements, tough-on-crime measures, and border crisis safeguards.

Governor DeSantis's remarkable accomplishments for Florida have propelled him to share his bold vision with the nation, leading the movement for the Great American Comeback. He is married to Casey DeSantis, an Emmy Award-winning television anchor, and they have three children togetherâ€”Madison, Mamie, and Mason.


#### presidentail Announcement

I am running for President of the United States because I want to lead Our Great American Comeback.

Our country is going in the wrong direction.  We see it with our eyes and we feel it in our bones.

* Our southern border has collapsed and drugs are pouring into our country, killing tens of thousands of our fellow Americans

* Our cities are being hollowed out by spiking crime -- the result of weak, ideologically-driven policies

* Our federal government is making it harder for the average family to make ends meet and to attain and maintain a middle class lifestyle

* Our president lacks vigor, flounders in the face of our nation's challenges, and takes his cues from the woke mob

But it doesn't have to be this way.

American decline is not inevitable -- it is a choice.  We should choose a new direction -- a path that will lead to American revitalization.

We must restore sanity to our nation.

* This means embracing Fiscal and economic sanity ... stop pricing hard-working Americans out of a good standard of living through inflationary borrow, print and spend policies.  And embrace American energy independence.

* This also means Replacing the woke mind virus with reality, facts, and enduring principles.  Merit must trump identity politics.

We must return normalcy to our communities.

* America is a sovereign country and our borders must be respected: we cannot have foreigners pouring into our country illegally by the millions, and we cannot allow drug cartels to poison our population with fentanyl.

* The public deserves safe communities and law and order must be maintained.  We cannot permit the inmates to run the asylum -- and we must reject attacks on the men and women of law enforcement.

We must reestablish integrity in our institutions.

* This includes our military.  US Navy and Iraq veteran.  When revered institutions like our own military are more concerned with matters not central to the mission -- from global warming to gender ideology and pronouns, morale declines and recruiting suffers.  We need to eliminate these distractions and get focused on the core mission.

* We cannot have true constitutional government if the most significant issues are decided by the whims of unelected bureaucrats, rather than the people's elected representatives.  Reestablishing integrity to our institutions means we must reinvigorate our constitutional system by returning the government to its rightful owners: we the people.  No social or economic transformation without representation.

Truth must be our foundation -- and common sense can no longer be an uncommon virtue.

In Florida, we proved that it could be done.

We chose facts over fear.

We chose Education over indoctrination.

We chose Law and order over rioting and disorder.

We held the line when freedom hung in the balance.

Florida is now thriving as a result -- the fastest growing state, #1 in net in-migration, #1 in new business formations, #1 in education, 50 year low crime rate, and one of the lowest tax and debt per capita rates in America.

Governing is not entertainment.  Its not about building a brand or virtue signaling on social media.  It is about results.  Our results in Florida have been second to none.

We can and we must deliver big results for America.

I pledge to be an energetic executive that will take on the important issues head on:

* Biden has pursued inflationary policies that are hurting working people; we will reverse those policies and build an economy where working Americans can achieve a good standard of living.

* Biden has opened the southern border and allowed massive amounts of drugs to pour into the country; we will shut down the border, construct a border wall, and hold the drug cartels accountable.

* Biden has embraced medical authoritarianism, such as unconstitutional covid vax mandates; we will ensure that those violations of liberty can never happen again.

* Biden has allowed woke ideology to drive his agenda.  We will never surrender to the woke mob and we will leave woke ideology in the dustbin of history.

* Biden has politicized the military and caused recruiting to plummet.  We will eliminate ideological agendas from the military, focus on the military's core mission, and reverse the poor recruiting trends.

* Biden has weaponized the power of the administrative state to advance his left-wing agenda.  We will re-constitutionalize the executive branch and bring the administrative state to heel.

You can't do any of this if you don't win.

There is no substitute for victory -- we must end the culture of losing that has infected the Republican party in recent years.

The tired dogmas of the past are inadequate for a vibrant future -- we must look forward, not backwards

The courage to lead.  The strength to win.

To voters participating in this primary process I can promise this: If you nominate me, you can set your clock to January 20, 2025 at high noon because on the west side of the US Capitol I will be taking the oath of office as the 47th president of the United States.

No excuses.  I will get it done.

The past few years have given me a new appreciation for the fragility of our freedoms.  Founding Fathers were keenly aware of this, studied every republic in history of mankind...

We have a lot of work to do to ensure our country gets back on track.  I ask you to join me on this mission.
