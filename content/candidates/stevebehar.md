Steve Behar's campaign for Congress focuses on several key issues, reflecting his dedication to improving the community:

1. **Education**: Behar has worked to drive over $300 million of investment into local schools, advocating for smaller class sizes, increased resources for teachers, and a strong emphasis on STEM education. He is committed to fully funding schools and never voting for budget cuts that could impact education quality.

2. **NYC Retirees' Healthcare**: Behar has been actively opposing NYC's plan to replace promised healthcare for retirees with substandard options. This issue is personal to him, as both his parents were NYC retirees. He pledges to continue leading the fight for retirees' healthcare rights.

3. **New 116th Precinct**: Recognizing the need for improved law enforcement presence and response times in Southeast Queens, Behar played a key role in securing $105 million for the new 116th Precinct. This initiative aims to alleviate the strain on the 105th Precinct and enhance community safety.

4. **Transportation**: Addressing the transportation challenges in his district, Behar advocates for improved bus services, including better Express Bus service to Manhattan and Bus Rapid Transit on the Q46 line. He also supports more affordable options for Eastern Queens on the Long Island Railroad.

5. **Co-ops and Condo Legislation**: Behar, a long-time co-op resident, has been involved in efforts to exempt garden apartment co-ops and condos from Local Law 97. He also supports revising the property taxation system in Albany to ensure co-ops and condos are taxed fairly, reflecting their role in providing affordable home ownership.

Behar's policy positions demonstrate his commitment to addressing a range of community concerns, from education and healthcare to law enforcement, transportation, and housing.
