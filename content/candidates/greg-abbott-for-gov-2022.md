## Greg Abbott  for governor 

Named “Best Governor in the Nation” in his current second term, Governor Greg Abbott continues to build on his record as a strong conservative leader who fights to preserve Texas values and ensure the Lone Star State remains the best place to raise a family, build a business, and create greater opportunity for all.

## Texas works when Texans work
Under Governor Abbott’s strong stewardship, the Texas economy has expanded to nearly $2 trillion as the Lone Star State continues to break all records for total jobs, with more Texans working than at any point in the state’s history.

With the Governor’s unwavering commitment to expanding opportunity, Texas is home to the most Fortune 500 headquarters in the nation, is the top state for attracting job-creating capital investments, and repeatedly leads all states for small business jobs growth.

## Securing our future
As our nation faces a surge of illegal crossings at our southern border, Governor Abbott is taking action with the most robust border security plan of any state in U.S. history. That includes: securing $4 billion in funding; launching Operation Lone Star and deploying thousands of Texas National Guard soldiers and Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers; arresting and jailing criminals trespassing or committing state crimes along the border; allocating resources, including acquiring 1,700 unused steel panels to build the border wall; busing migrants to Washington, D.C.; signing memoranda of understanding with four governors of Mexico to enhance border security; authorizing Texas National Guard and DPS to return illegal immigrants to the border; and more.

## Addressing the state’s most pressing issues
In the 87th Legislative Session, the Governor achieved significant legislative victories to build a safer, freer, and more prosperous future for Texas: adding COVID liability protections for Texas businesses, employees, and healthcare providers; expanding broadband access; enacting laws to stop cities from defunding the police; reforming the Electric Reliability Council of Texas; and weatherizing the state’s power system to protect against extreme weather events. Other successes include passing Constitutional Carry, defending religious freedoms, and passing the heartbeat bill to ensure every unborn child with a heartbeat is saved from abortion.

Landmark legislation passed in previous sessions included the Governor’s priorities of: reining in skyrocketing property taxes; investing more in our classrooms and teachers; keeping our schools safe; combatting human trafficking; strengthening disaster preparedness and response; reforming the child protective system; reining in regulations; improving Texas roads; and cutting billions of dollars in taxes.

## Defined by perseverance
Before his election in 2014 as the 48th Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott was the 50th and longest-serving Attorney General of Texas, earning a national reputation for defending religious liberty and protecting Texas communities and children. He also previously served as a Justice on the Texas Supreme Court and as a State District Judge in Harris County.

A native Texan and avid sportsman and hunter, Governor Abbott was born in Wichita Falls and raised in Duncanville. After graduating from The University of Texas at Austin, he earned a law degree from Vanderbilt University Law School.

Shortly after graduating from law school, he was partially paralyzed by a falling tree while jogging. From his faith and family, he gained strength, recognizing “our lives are not defined by our challenges, but by how we respond to them.”

Governor Abbott and his wife, Cecilia, a former teacher and principal, and the first Hispanic First Lady of Texas, were married in 1981. Their daughter, Audrey, works in the music industry.
