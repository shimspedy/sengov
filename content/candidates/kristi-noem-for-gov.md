#### Kristi Noem for governor 
Kristi Noem is a wife, mother, grandmother, rancher, farmer, small business owner, and New York Times bestselling author of "Not My First Rodeo: Lessons from the Heartland."

Governor Kristi Noem’s political career began with her 2006 election to the South Dakota State Legislature followed by her move to the United States House of Representatives and finally a return to Pierre as the state’s first female Governor. Each new office brought an ever-evolving set of responsibilities, but the mission has remained constant – make South Dakota a better place. Every policy decision and executive strategy is undertaken with that end goal in mind.

Like so many who were raised in South Dakota, the concept of family drives Governor Noem’s principles. The values instilled in her as a child, the ideals she lives by today, and the vision she holds for the future are all linked to a strong family foundation. Preserving and strengthening an environment that allows families to thrive is central to achieving that vision, and Governor Noem has proven that a conservative government approach fosters that environment.

South Dakota is a better place when the economy is strong, when government is limited, and when people are free to exercise their God-given rights. Governor Noem fought against federal tax increases, and she is fiercely protective of preserving a system of no state income tax. She’s a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and is steadfast in maintaining Constitutional carry rights. She’s unwavering in her commitment to personal freedom and will always fight against government intrusion.

Nothing, however, exceeds Governor Noem’s dedication to raising her three children Kassidy, Kennedy and Booker with her husband, Bryon. All have a deep love for their family and an even deeper love for the Lord. The prosperity of South Dakota is important to her for the same reason it’s important to everyone else in the state – it’s home.

Under Governor Noem’s leadership, South Dakota has served as a great example to the nation of what can be accomplished when you follow the governing philosophies our founders set in place. God bestows individual liberty and people should be able to exercise their freedoms without bureaucratic interference. Government’s role is to serve the people, working for them to provide opportunities for a better future. With Governor Noem, the focus will always be on making South Dakota a better place.

#### Accomplishments
In 2010, after serving in the South Dakota legislature for several years, Noem was elected to serve as South Dakota’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. During her time in Congress, in addition to many other successes, Governor Noem helped pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which put $2,400 back in the pockets of the average South Dakota family.

In 2018, with the platform of protecting South Dakotans against tax increases, government growth, federal intrusion, and government secrecy, she was elected as South Dakota’s first-ever female Governor.

As Governor, Noem has respected the rights of her people by trusting them to exercise their personal responsibility to make the best decisions for themselves, their loved-ones, and – in turn – their communities. This approach has been most evident in her response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Governor Noem never ordered a single business or church to close and never issued a statewide shelter-in-place order.

Despite all of this, Governor Noem often says that her greatest accomplishment is raising her three children, Kassidy, Kennedy, and Booker, with her husband Bryon. All have a deep love for their family and an even deeper love for the Lord.
