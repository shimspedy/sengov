## Bill Lee for governor
Bill Lee is a seventh-generation Tennessean who was raised in Franklin where he still resides today with his wife Maria on his family’s farm. He’s the proud father of four adult children (Jessica, twin sons Jacob and Caleb, and Sarah Kate) and nine grandchildren.

After attending Williamson County Schools, Bill went to Auburn University, where he studied Mechanical Engineering. When he graduated, he returned home to Franklin to join the family business his grandfather started in 1944. He held several roles at Lee Company before becoming president of the company in 1992.

Under Bill’s leadership, the company grew into a comprehensive facilities solutions and home services company. It now employs more than 1,200 individuals and it has won numerous awards for work culture and business accomplishments.

In 2018, Bill entered the race for governor as a conservative outsider and became the first back to back Republican governor elected since Reconstruction in Tennessee. During his first term, Bill prioritized rural improvement, expanding parents’ role in education, tackling violent crime, pursuing criminal justice reform and growing economic opportunity in Tennessee.

As governor, Bill chairs the Republican Governors Public Policy Committee which has been a stabilizing force for challenges with the supply chain, border security and pushing back on federal overreach.

Bill and Maria are people of strong faith. They are active in Grace Chapel Church and in numerous faith-based ministries, which have taken them all over the world to serve people in need, including to Africa, Central America, and the Middle East.
