#### Who is Dean Phillips?
I am a third-term Democratic Congressman from Minnesota with a strong and independent voice of reason, a focus on inclusive, collaborative problem solving, and a commitment to principled leadership. And now, I am your Democratic candidate for President of the United States of America.

I first ran for Congress in 2018 after Trump got elected because I wanted to try and make a difference in where the country was heading. I am now running for President because I genuinely believe as things stand now, Donald Trump is poised to beat Dean Phillips, and it's imperative we have another option to consider before it's too late.

I am the only member of Congress who refuses to take any money from PACs, federal lobbyists, or other members of Congress. I believe deeply that the way money works in government and politics is the root of our problem and demands reform. I was also selected as one of the most bipartisan members of Congress by Common Ground Committee.

Prior to entering politics, I founded and sold Talenti Gelato and was active in the non-profit sector. I am excited to bring a multidisciplinary background of public service, business, and non-profit experience to leadership.

#### Dean Phillips’s Commitments
I care deeply about making life for Americans more affordable. We have far too many people that cannot afford the increasingly expensive cost of living and our current economic policies are not working for everyday people the way they need to be. I will be focused on implementing policies that can help relieve this and ensure we continue to have opportunity for the next generation.

I believe very deeply that we must reduce the current political divisions we have in this country. Democracy cannot function when there is such strong factionalism and hate between people of different ideals and beliefs. We need to have the courage to do things differently and I will lead with principle, ethics, and inclusiveness of voices of all backgrounds.

#### Dean Phillips’s Family
I am a fifth-generation Minnesotan, the husband of Annalise Phillips, and the father of two remarkable daughters and our Norwich Terrier, Henry.

My mother is a retired shop owner and my brother is a physician.

My birth father was killed in the Vietnam War and I was adopted into the Phillips family when my mother remarried. I was fortunate to grow up in a blended family of great ethics, encouragement, opportunity, and love. It also demanded accountability, responsibility, hard work, and civic engagement. I live with gratitude for my blessings and was taught that success is not to be measured by how much one collects, rather by how much one shares.

#### Jobs and the Economy

"As a business owner for my entire professional life before Congress, I know that small businesses are the engine that drive our economy, and as a member of the Small Business Committee in Congress, I have made supporting them a top priority. I believe that smart public policy is both pro-business and pro-worker. Those ideas are not mutually exclusive. That’s why I’m an advocate for policies that grow the economy by reducing red tape, investing in people, rewarding innovation, and sharing in success.”

Dean has a diverse history in business development and oversight, from start-ups to working his way up within his family owned business, Phillips Distilling, ultimately leading the organization.

Dean later helped build Talenti Gelato into the third-largest premium ice cream brand in the country before selling it and launching a small chain of coffee shops in the Twin Cities.

In Congress, Dean serves on the House Small Business Committee and chairs the Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight, and Regulations. Dean is also a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, co-founder of the Stakeholder Capitalism Caucus, and a member of the Entrepreneurship Caucus.

Dean wrote and passed into law the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act in the 116th Congress, and his efforts led to passage of the Relief for Restaurants and Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act of 2022.


#### Healthcare for All Americans

"I believe it’s time we make the moral decision to ensure every American has affordable, high-quality healthcare, regardless of their age, condition, geography, or ability to pay."

I will support immediate action that gets us closer to that goal—and I will not rest until it’s achieved.”

Dean supports universal health insurance coverage and continues to be active in efforts to expand access and lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs.

In addition to helping pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which will lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, Dean is an original co-sponsor of HR 4974, the State Public Option Act, which would allow individuals and families to buy into their state’s Medicaid program while granting Americans with employer-provided care, that works for them, the freedom to keep it.

Dean also authored HR 4480, the Telehealth Coverage and Payment Parity Act, which requires private insurers to cover the cost of certain telehealth services. He remains a vocal proponent of legislation like HR2366, the STOP Fentanyl Act of 2021, that will expand access to mental health services for substance abuse prevention and treatment programs.


#### Public Safety

"Everyone deserves to feel safe in our community, no matter their race, income, or zip code."

I salute those public servants who put on a uniform and risk their lives to protect and serve us, and I believe we can enhance public safety by providing funding for police departments and other first responders for the recruitment and retention of the best and the brightest from our communities, for up-to-date training practices and access to necessary equipment, and for mental health services for community members and first responders alike.”

Dean has been a vocal proponent of efforts to provide police departments with the funding necessary to recruit and retain the best and the brightest, ensure access to appropriate training and equipment, and rethink our approach to mental health and substance abuse-related emergencies.

Dean authored and sponsored the Pathways to Policing Act to provide funding to bolster officer recruitment efforts, including from non-traditional backgrounds and underrepresented communities, and as a leader of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, which has been actively pushing for votes on this bill along with the Invest to Protect Act, the Mental Health Justice Act, and more.


#### Public Education

"We must work together at all levels of government to ensure that every American child receives a world-class public education—no matter their race or zip code. I’ve spent the majority of my adult life working to create more opportunity for young people, and I will continue to make that a top priority as a member of Congress.”

Dean’s top priority in Congress is ensuring our schools have the federal resources they need to support their students, teachers, and other support professionals.

That’s why Dean is a cosponsor of the IDEA Full Funding Act, which would fully fund the federal government’s portion of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act over a 10-year period.

He also believes the federal government should support and build upon intensive mentoring programs during new teachers’ first years, which will help them succeed and create more opportunity for young people, and of equal importance, ensure access to mental and emotional health services in every school.


#### Gun Violence Prevention

"Thoughts and tweets don’t save lives—courage and action save lives. For too long, Congress did nothing in the face of an epidemic of gun violence in our country. I’m proud to be part of a new generation in Congress that made gun violence prevention a priority, which led to the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – the first meaningful gun violence legislation in nearly three decades. More must be done to keep our kids and communities safe, however, and I remain as committed as ever to that work.”

Dean is a responsible gun owner and a member of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, where he has sought and supported bipartisan solutions to address our nation’s gun violence epidemic. In addition, Dean supported and helped pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first meaningful gun violence prevention legislation to become law in nearly 30 years.

Dean also co-sponsored and voted for HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and HR 1808, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022, to help prevent weapons of war from falling into the wrong hands.


#### Campaign Finance Reform and Ethics

"No matter your number one issue, I ask you to make campaign finance reform your number two. The corrupting influence of special interest money in politics, and the time spent in its pursuit, are at the heart of the dysfunction in Washington, DC, preventing progress on the major challenges we face as a country. That is why I am on a mission to get money out of politics and return power to where it belongs: the people.”

Dean is the ONLY member of Congress—out of 538—who refuses ALL money from federal lobbyists, PACs, other special interest groups, and fellow members of Congress. This means Dean is beholden only to his own principles and the people he represents in Congress.

"I will advocate raising the ethical bar in Congress and the Supreme Court. The current system is an unmitigated disaster. It is legalized corruption, and I will tackle it.”


#### Clean Water and a Healthy Planet

"The strength of our economy—not to mention our future health and well-being—relies on responsible stewardship of our waterways, forests, farmland, wetlands, and public lands. Preserving and improving them for generations to come should be a unifying effort, and I am committed to listening, learning, identifying solutions, and acting together.”

As a fifth-generation Minnesotan, Dean understands the importance of preserving and protecting our abundant natural resources for generations to come.

In Congress, Dean has focused specifically on protecting access to clean water. As a member of the Congressional PFAS Task Force, Dean is committed to working together to establish a sound, bipartisan approach to preventing harmful chemicals from poisoning our clean water.

Dean is also a leading champion for protecting the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, one of the most treasured and pristine wilderness areas in the country.

For these reasons, numerous conservation and environmental organizations endorsed Dean throughout his Congressional campaigns.


#### Climate Action

"The effects of climate change are now being seen and felt by nearly every American and by people across the world. Our planet will survive, but if we don’t take urgent action, humanity may not – and America must resume its role as a global leader in addressing this crisis.”

"Fortunately, the climate investments signed into law as part of the Inflation Reduction Act are both historic and meaningful. The incentives included in it will help lower energy costs and speed our transition to a clean energy economy while cutting emissions by 40% by 2030. This alone will not put a stop to the climate crisis – but it’s a darn good start.”

In Congress, Dean has been a vocal advocate for legislation to cut greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate the effects of climate change, and create more resilient communities.

In addition to supporting and voting for the climate investments included in the Inflation Reduction Act, Dean is an original co-sponsor of HR 2307, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which would put a price on carbon and return the proceeds to every taxpayer, along with HR 8395, the EPA Regulatory Authority Act of 2022, which would restore the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.


#### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

"We are a rapidly-diversifying country, and it is that diversity, which makes America great."

Still, we must confront the realities of our nation’s complicated past and work to reform the systems, structures, and policies that have—intentionally or otherwise—led to wide disparities in healthcare, education, housing, and economic achievement if we are to live up to the ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and afforded by our Constitution.”

As an ally and member of the Congressional Equality Caucus in Congress and someone who has long been involved in efforts to address racial disparities in Minnesota, Dean is committed to listening to, learning from, and acting on behalf Americans who have been held back simply because of their race, gender, or sexual identity.

Dean understands that in a country where all are created equal, disparities can only exist because our policies, systems, or structures have—intentionally or otherwise—propagated them.

He is committed to confronting hard truths and ensuring that all Americans enjoy equal opportunities to live comfortably and prosper.


#### Higher Education and Job Training

"Every American should have access to an affordable two or four-year college degree, apprenticeship, or job-training certificate that prepares them for jobs of the future."

This isn’t just good for individual learners and their families; it’s good for businesses, it’s good for our communities, and it will help grow America’s economy.”

Every American with a desire for higher education, apprenticeships or certifications should be able to access those opportunities to better prepare for sustainable employment and the jobs of the future. And while he supports targeted relief for federal student debt holders with the greatest need—including those pursuing in-demand professions, such as teaching, nursing, and law enforcement—Dean believes we must treat the underlying problem of college affordability rather than engage in short-term actions to treat the symptoms.

As Vice Chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, Dean has supported bipartisan solutions to these challenges, including the Supporting Apprenticeship Colleges Act in Congress.


#### Immigration Reform

"My family came to this country for the same reasons as many others: for opportunity and a place of refuge from persecution. The America I know and love is a compassionate America that values and welcomes hard-working people who come here with big dreams and a simple wish for safety and opportunity. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue. It is a human issue—and an economic issue—and we must do better.”

Dean supports comprehensive immigration reform, including enhanced border security, a pathway to citizenship for those here now, and a streamlined process for those seeking to enter the country legally.

In Congress, Dean has helped pass legislation through the House, such as HR 6, the American Dream and Promise Act, which provides for a path to citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants. In addition, he led the effort to provide permanent status for Liberian refugees, many of whom have lived here legally for decades but under the constant threat of eventual deportation.


#### Retirement security

"Every hard-working American deserves the opportunity to retire with dignity. Those in or near retirement have worked hard and paid into the system all their lives, and we must honor that promise by working in a bipartisan fashion to ensure the elements of a secure retirement are protected – including Social Security, Medicare, and federal support for caregivers."

Dean understands that we must work in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that the elements of a secure retirement are protected, including Social Security and Medicare.

That is why he has supported Congressional action to create commissions that would provide recommendations for balanced action to make these federal programs solvent into the future, while also acknowledging the need to enhance benefits for retirees.


#### Veterans Services and Support

"I lost my birth father, Artie, in the Vietnam War, so I know all too well the sacrifices made by our veterans and their families. As a Gold Star Son and member of Congress, I’m on a mission to ensure we take care of those who risk their lives in service to our country—and that we don’t forget about the families they leave behind.”


#### Women’s Health and Economic Security

"The Supreme Court’s decision to unravel decades of settled law and allow states to outlaw abortion with no exceptions is both dangerous and shortsighted, and Congress must take action to codify Roe and protect a woman’s right to make decisions about her health.

"I remember my mother wearing a green ‘ERA Now’ pin almost 50 years ago, and it is outrageous that we still have not ratified it. I will continue to be a fierce advocate for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and the advancement of women’s health, economic security, and reproductive freedom in Congress.”

Dean is a member of the Pro-Choice Caucus in Congress and he believes patients—not politicians—should have the freedom to make personal decisions about their own health, including reproductive health.

In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v Wade, Dean co-sponsored and voted for HR 8297, the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act, and HR 8111, the My Body, My Data Act—each of which would protect women seeking reproductive health care out-of-state—as well as HR 3755, the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify the reproductive freedoms previously guaranteed by Roe.
