#### Jamie Smithfor governor 

Jamie serves as Minority Leader in the South Dakota House of Representatives, where he has delivered bipartisan solutions for the people of South Dakota. Jamie believes we are strongest when we work together to get things done.

Jamie is a lifelong South Dakotan. A realtor and former educator, Jamie isn’t a career politician, and he understands the needs of all South Dakotans. Every day, Jamie rolls up his sleeves to bring people together on the big issues South Dakotans face: affordable housing, high-quality education and healthcare, and an economy that works for everyone.

Jamie is a devoted father and husband. His wife of 23 years, Kjerstin, is a middle school librarian. He’s the proud father of two sons: Johnathan and Isaac. Rounding out the family is Maggie, their Goldendoodle.

#### unity
Despite our differences, public leaders on both sides of the political spectrum should be able to reach across the aisle for common-sense solutions to real South Dakota problems. 
Unity is possible and approaching issues by seeing the humanity in one another is the way to end the infighting in Pierre.

#### economy
Bringing good-paying jobs into South Dakota is of the utmost importance. South Dakota has so much untapped potential when it comes to our labor force. Promoting sustainable growth will be prioritized from day one.

#### marijuana legalization
The people of South Dakota voted for the legalization of recreational marijuana and that vote was not only ignored, but impeded by Governor Noem at every turn. The Governor’s office should never use state dollars in order to sue and overturn the will of the people. Recreational marijuana should be legalized in South Dakota.

#### corruption
Through her personal ambitions and desire to ascend the ranks in national politics, Kristi Noem has brought DC-style politics to South Dakota. A Republican-led legislative panel found that she broke her oath of office and betrayed the public trust by giving a family member preferential treatment through a state agency and forcing out a longtime state employee for refusing to comply with this request. Corruption like this has no place in South Dakota.

#### healthcare
Expanding Medicaid in South Dakota is crucial for protecting our rural communities and essential workers. It will allow thousands to stay insured, get access to medication, and see a doctor.
