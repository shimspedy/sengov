Congressman Long was born and raised in Missouri’s 7th Congressional District where he proudly serves his constituents today.

Congressman Long has always believed we need more lawmakers in Washington, D.C. with real-world experience. He owned and operated auction and real estate businesses in southwest Missouri before running for office.

Voted ‘Best Auctioneer in the Ozarks’ 9 years straight, it’s no surprise he has been inducted into both the National Auctioneers’ Association Hall of Fame and the Missouri Professional Auctioneers’ Association Hall of Fame. His motto in the Auction business was “When you want it done right” and that attitude holds today. While he’s known for his unconventional, out of the box thinking, it all gets back to trying to do his best whether that’s selling grandma’s antiques or negotiating with his colleagues on Capitol Hill for the best outcome for his constituents. He’s known for his good nature and humor in Washington which both serve him well when negotiating with colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 

For six years, he co-hosted the top rated morning drive time radio call in show ‘Morning Line’ with his co-host Bonnie Bell’ in Springfield on AM560 KWTO “Keep Watching The Ozarks” – which covered 95 counties and part of four states. Engaging with folks for 30 years while booking auctions, selling real estate and taking their calls on air gave him a vast knowledge of what was on folks minds and what was important to them.

Billy has always believed that the principles of life, liberty, freedom and the power of the individual are values that we need to protect. As a result of his conservative track record, he has received countless awards from organizations such as the American Conservative Union, FreedomWorks, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, Safari Club International and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. As the awards continue to pile up, he considers the true reward is being in a position to help people.

Congressman Long sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee where he serves on three crucial subcommittees: Communications and Technology, Health, and Oversight and Investigations.

- A few of Congressman Long's legislative priorities and accomplishments are listed below.

#### Protecting Table Rock Lake homeowners
Congressman Long has introduced legislation aimed to protect homeowners on Table Rock Lake from being forced to remove existing structures due to the Army Corps of Engineers boundary lines changing over time.

#### Reducing Diesel Emissions  
Congressman Long worked across the aisle with Congresswoman Doris Matui to reauthorize the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA). DERA has proven to be a cost effective way to reduce harmful emissions from old diesel engines.

#### Stopping Bad Robocalls 
During the 116th Congress, Congressman Long and his colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee worked to bring H.R. 3375 (Stopping Bad Robocalls Act) to the House floor - legislation that expands protections for consumers, increases the length of time the FCC can catch illegal robocallers and allows the federal government to issue penalties up to $10,000 per violation.

#### Rural Broadband Deployment
Congressman Long has championed legislation aimed to strengthen Internet access in rural and other underserved areas by promoting more Internet Exchanges across the country.

Congressman Long worked with Congressman Donald McEachin, Congressman Dave Loebsack, and Congressman Bob Latta to pass legislation that improves the accuracy of broadband maps throughout the nation. A key first step in the buildout of rural broadband infrastructure

#### Suicide Prevention 
Congressman Long worked with Congressman Emanuel Cleaver on legislation that would give states funding for emotional wellbeing, mental health and suicide prevention training for school personnel in elementary and secondary schools.

## America First
Democrats are doing everything they can to change America and usher in Socialism, they are teaching our children to hate America. I have fought to implement the America First Agenda and put our interests first. I will continue to push back on Communist China stealing our intellectual property rights and encourage American companies to expand in America that will benefit our workforce and economy.

## Securing the Border
Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are flowing into our country, we must put an end to the Biden/Harris disaster at the border. Having an open border invites drug traffing, human trafficking, and more. We must secure our border, finish the wall, reinstate the “remain in Mexico” policy, put an end to sanctuary cities, and enforce a merit-based visa system.

## Election Integrity
The American people deserve to feel confident in the outcome of their elections and that their vote counted but as long as there are opportunities for fraud our elections aren’t secure. We need to require voters to show a photo ID, we need to end ballot harvesting, and restore confidence in our elections, it is critical to the future of this country.

## Out of Control Spending
Our national debt continues to climb, and inflation is running rampant, but the Democrats keep spending trillions of dollars that we do not have. We are burdening our children and our children's children with massive amounts of debt. We can’t tax our way out of this spending problem, we must put an end to the out of control spending sprees.

## Supporting Our Farmers
Missouri Farmers are the lifeblood of our economy. If this past year has shown us anything, it is how critical our agriculture and food supply chain is vulnerable. I am proud of the legislation that I have sponsored and enacted to enable farmers to work their land without the burdensome paperwork and having to comply with unnecessary government regulations. We need to secure the next generation of farmers by removing the death tax and put an end to foreign entities buying up our valuable agricultural land and businesses.

## Preserving the Second Amendment
The right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. I am a proven supporter of your right to keep and bear arms and will fight gun-grabbing politicians from infringing on that right. As your Senator I will work tirelessly to defend your 2nd Amendment rights and I won’t back down in protecting this fundamental right.

## Protecting the Unborn
I am 100 percent pro-life. I will support Supreme Court nominees who support ending abortions in the United States. I will continue to advocate for the rights of the unborn and will actively fight against legislation that allows taxpayer dollars to fund abortions.
