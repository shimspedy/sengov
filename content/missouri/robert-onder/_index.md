Congressman Onder is a respected physician, attorney, and dedicated public servant who has used his background to lead on issues impacting Missourians in both Jefferson City and Washington, D.C.

Dr. Onder received his MD from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and his JD from Saint Louis University Law School. In 1992, he opened a private practice specializing in allergy, asthma, and clinical immunology, where he served Missourians for over 30 years.

In 2006, Dr. Onder was elected to the Missouri State Legislature as the Representative for District 13. In 2014, he was elected to the Missouri State Senate, where he served as Assistant Majority Floor Leader. He completed two terms in the Missouri State Senate before being term-limited in 2018.

Dr. Onder was elected to represent Missouri’s Third Congressional District in 2024 and was sworn into the 119th Congress on January 3, 2025. He currently serves on the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.

Congressman Onder and his wife, Allison, reside in St. Charles County, Missouri, where he enjoys hunting and spending time with his family. They have six adult children.

#### Fighting illegal immigration
As a member of the Missouri House, Dr. Onder sponsored and passed HB1549 in 2008 to ban Sanctuary Cities, crack down on public employers and contractors who hire illegal aliens, and end catch-and-release of illegal aliens. The Federation for American Immigration Reform called this the strongest state law in the country to fight illegal immigration.

#### Defending Life
Dr. Onder was the author of 2017’s SB1/SB5, restoring common sense health and safety standards on abortion clinics and protecting pregnancy care centers. In committee he was a principal author of 2019’s HB 126, the “Heartbeat Bill,” which Missouri Right to Life called the most important pro-life bill in Missouri history. HB 126 included a trigger clause that enabled Missouri to be the first in the nation to protect all innocent human life.

#### Standing Up for the Second Amendment
Dr. Onder was a leader in the Senate leading to the passage of Constitutional Carry in 2016 and the Second Amendment Preservation Act in 2019. He also sponsored legislation to expand the Castle Doctrine and to allow exercise of one’s constitutional rights on public transit (“Metro Carry”). 

#### Fighting for Lower Taxes
Dr. Onder has repeatedly sponsored legislation to lower income taxes, including SB902 (2022), SB245 (2021), and SB640 (2020).

#### Fighting the Woke Agenda
Dr. Onder sponsored legislation, SB638, to guard against public school children being indoctrinated with divisive Critical Race Theory. He was the sponsor of SJR 39, the Religious Liberty Amendment, in 2016. He filed and passed legislation in 2021 to reign in COVID public health tyrants. After leaving the Senate 2023 he led citizen groups in the fight against gender activists, leading to the passage of legislation to protect women’s sports and outlaw harmful transgender hormonal or surgical “treatments” of children. 

#### securing Our Election
In 2022, Dr. Onder was the Senate leader in negotiating a package of election reforms, HB1878, that made Missouri’s voting system among the most secure in the nation. In doing so, he thwarted proposals to extend early voting, mail-in voting, and drop boxes. The final bill banned Zuckerbucks and mandated paper ballots.

#### Standing With Israel
Dr. Onder sponsored and passed anti-BDS legislation, SB739, preventing taxpayer dollars from going to entities engaged in a boycott against Israel.

#### Supports Welfare Reform
Dr. Onder led successful fights against Obamacare Medicaid Expansion in 2021, and against Bidencare Medicaid Expansion in 2022. Also in 2022, Dr. Onder fought a Democrat-sponsored plan, SB 798, that would have allowed food stamps to be used for restaurant meals and fast food.
