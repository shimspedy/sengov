All his life, Wesley Bell has worked to find solutions to problems big and small. Raised in North St. Louis County, Bell is the son of a police officer and county civil servant. His childhood instilled a deep appreciation for public service. Wesley graduated from Hazelwood East public schools, Lindenwood University, and the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law.

Wesley’s service is rooted in first-hand experience of the challenges facing working Missourians. He worked at a Shoney’s at the age of 16, for a phone company, as a youth sports referee to help put himself through college at Lindenwood, and later as a criminal justice professor and a municipal judge.

After graduating from law school, Wesley returned to St. Louis and worked as a public defender, where he saw first-hand the lack of common sense and fairness in the criminal justice system.

Wesley worked directly to calm tensions between residents and the police — sometimes physically standing between protestors and police. On the Council, Wesley worked with the Department of Justice to reform Ferguson’s criminal justice system through police and court reform. Improvements included more thorough police training, implementation of officer body cams, pay raises for police, reforms to rules for how police are allowed to use physical force, and an overhaul of the city’s court system.

In 2018, Wesley took on the political establishment and was elected St. Louis Prosecuting Attorney, challenging a longtime incumbent in a campaign that political insiders told him he had no chance of winning. Door by door, phone call by phone call, he proved the establishment wrong – and then got to work as St. Louis County Prosecutor, running the largest prosecuting attorney’s office in the State of Missouri and working to make St. Louis County a safer place.

Wesley has been a strong leader for common-sense solutions to ensure law enforcement is more effective, efficient, and accountable. He worked to establish the North County Police Cooperative, a department modeled on community policing, to save taxpayer money and improve service. As the elected St Louis County Prosecutor, Wesley created a violent crimes unit dedicated to domestic violence and an auto theft task force. Wesley also expanded diversion programs for low-level, non-violent offenders struggling with mental health issues and opioid and substance abuse disorder with a nearly 90% success rate.

Bell is committed to strengthening our economy by focusing on workers and job and skills training, lowering health insurance and prescription drug costs, standing up for seniors, and protecting our planet by fighting climate change.

#### Delivering for CD-01
My first priority will always be to hear and raise the voices of people in our community—getting tangible results for our district and providing steady and effective representation for the St. Louis region. St. Louis is a sleeping giant primed to grow and expand. We need leadership in Washington that understands the value of legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and what it provides for our community. I am committed to supporting policy that brings resources back home to our district and I will work on a bipartisan basis—and with President Biden—to get this done.

#### Common Sense Gun Reform and Public Safety
As a responsible gun owner, I support common sense gun safety laws. It is critical that we pass these laws in order to improve public safety. Gun violence is the single most preventable issue that our country is facing. As the Prosecuting Attorney in the largest county in the state, I see first-hand how gun violence tears apart our communities. During my time in office, I have made significant changes to improve public safety and address gun violence in St. Louis County. Our Gun Violence Reduction Task Force, Chiefs Advisory Committee, and expansion of ShotSpotter technology have helped address underlying issues that lead to crime. We have worked tirelessly with our partners within 55 police departments to improve public safety.

Accomplishments in office:

- Created a Community Outreach Division that works with residents to build relationships and address underlying issues that lead to crime
- Diverted over 2,500 non-violent offenders from jail into programs, who were struggling with mental health issues and substance abuse disorders with a success rate of 96%
- Hired social workers to focus on social and behavioral issues that lawyers aren’t trained to address in an effort to foster equity and safety
- Implemented a Violence Reduction Strategy that focuses on evidence-based approaches to reduce crime. Highlights include a violent crimes unit dedicated to domestic violence and an auto theft task force
- Investing in community programs that provide opportunities for youth and other at-risk individuals
- Worked with community partners to create a restorative justice center in St. Louis County

#### Choice
Every person deserves the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions without government mandates or political interference. The sad reality in Missouri is that women do not have access to abortion at all, including in cases of rape and incest. Across the country, right-wing extremists—in legislatures and in courts—are restricting or banning access to reproductive care as they push for a federal ban. In 2022, I was one of the first county prosecutors in the country to sign a letter vowing not to prosecute those who seek or perform abortions. I will always fight for women’s rights to access safe and legal reproductive health care, including abortion and birth control. I will support federal legislation to codify the central components of Roe v. Wade into law to protect a woman's fundamental right to reproductive freedom.

#### Foreign Policy
Our steadfast relationships with global allies are essential to our national security and prosperity. These relationships help promote peace and stability in the world. We must continue to work with our allies to address shared challenges, such as climate change and terrorism, and be willing to stand up for our values. By working together, we can build a more secure and prosperous world for all. Right now, democracies across the globe are under attack. Ukraine continues to resist the illegal invasion of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Israel—the only democracy and strongest American ally in the Middle East—was attacked by terrorists on October 7. I believe Israel has the right to defend itself and go after those who perpetrated those attacks. In Congress, I’ll fight to make sure the United States remains Israel’s strongest ally.

#### Environmental Justice
Climate change is a crisis, and we need to be doing more to address it. Everyone should live in a clean and healthy environment regardless of their race, income, or ZIP code. Here in Missouri, the effects of climate change are already making an impact on our way of life and the safety of vulnerable communities. As Prosecuting Attorney, I have always made an effort to meet with advocacy groups so I can learn more about the issues facing our region. I will continue to work with these groups to ensure the removal and cleanup of radioactive waste near Westlake Landfill and along Coldwater Creek in North St. Louis County. We must work together to combat climate change in a way that grows the economy and creates jobs at the same time.

#### Healthcare
Everyone should be able to have access to quality, affordable health care. No one should lose their home due to medical bills, or be forced to choose between paying for groceries or paying for their prescriptions. I know firsthand how challenging this issue is. When I owned a small business, a health matter set me back. I was unable to work for a period of time, and without access to great providers, I would not have been able to navigate recovery and keep my job. We must do more to strengthen and expand healthcare coverage, lower costs, expand access to insurance, and make it easier to hire the best doctors and nurses.

#### Protecting our Democracy and Safeguarding Voting Rights
I am running for office because I love our country and what it stands for. Although it is far from perfect, the system of democracy we have is one that needs to be protected and upheld to make sure that every vote is counted and every voice is heard. What happened on January 6 was wrong. What our former president did to tear down our election system and manipulate election results was wrong. I will be standing strong to ensure that these kinds of things do not happen again.

I am committed to removing unnecessarily restrictive barriers that stand between voters and the ballot box. I will work to increase voter registration and education so that all Americans can exercise this fundamental right. On this issue, I am reminded of the words of the great civil rights pioneer and icon John Lewis: "Some of us gave a little blood for the right to participate in the democratic process." We must keep working to honor his legacy and commitment to democracy. At a time when our fundamental rights and freedoms are under attack, I'm ready to continue the fight for voting rights because our democracy is only as strong as those who participate in it.

#### Education
Every student deserves to have a world-class public education, regardless of their ZIP code or their family’s income. As a former educator, I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t work when it comes to reforming our education system. Students graduating high school should know about all of the educational and career paths in front of them. That includes four-year colleges, community colleges, trade schools, and apprenticeship programs. And I support the Biden-Harris Administration’s initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

#### LGBTQ+
Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and has the right to go to school, work, church or a public event without fear of discrimination or harm. Everyone should have the right to marry the person they love, and build their own families in safe communities. And every child has the right to play, learn and grow up without facing hate and discrimination for who they are. I’ll work to be an ally for our LGBTQ comunity in congress, and at home in Missouri.

#### Immigration
The St. Louis region has been enriched and strengthened by generations of immigrants choosing to start new lives in our community. But for decades, Washington politicians have kicked the can down the road instead of actually coming together and tackling this issue. It’s time for comprehensive immigration reform that addresses current challenges and prepares for the future as well.

We need to work toward finding the appropriate balance in creating a system that ensures safety and security at the border, while also treating people with dignity and respect, and honoring the rights of asylum seekers. A pathway to citizenship must be established for those who are already here, working hard, and paying taxes. We need to ensure that our country is protected from MS-13 gang members, drug traffickers, and terrorists. You can count on me to fight to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security has adequate funding to serve our country.
