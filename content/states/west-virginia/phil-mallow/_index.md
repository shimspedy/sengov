Phil Mallow was born on July 6th, 1957, and he hails from the great state of West Virginia. His educational journey led him to Allegany College of Maryland, where he likely honed the skills that would later serve him well in public service. Before entering politics, Mallow worked in management at UPS—a background that surely provided valuable insights into logistics, organization, and community needs.

In the realm of West Virginia politics, Delegate Mallow wears multiple hats.

Additionally, he serves on the Government Organization and Judiciary committees, as well as the Workforce Development committee. These roles underscore his commitment to improving the lives of his constituents.

But that’s not all—Delegate Mallow’s dedication extends beyond regular legislative sessions. In the interim, he chairs the Subcommittee for Volunteer Fire Departments and Emergency Medical Services, emphasizing his concern for the well-being of those who protect and serve our communities. He also participates in committees related to government organization, judiciary matters, and workforce development and labor issues.
