Wayne Clark was born on February 16, 1972, in Baltimore, Maryland. His journey has been marked by dedication to public service, community engagement, and a passion for both politics and golf.

Wayne’s political career gained momentum when he assumed office as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, representing District 99. He officially began this role on December 1, 2022. Prior to that, he had represented the 65th district for one 2-year term, from 2020 to 2022.

Beyond the political arena, Wayne wears another hat—he is the proud owner of Locust Hill Golf Course. His love for golf extends beyond personal enjoyment; he is associated with the Professional Golfers Association of America (PGA) and the First Tee of West Virginia, demonstrating his commitment to both the sport and community engagement.

Wayne’s family plays an essential role in his life. He is married to Wendy, and together they have three children: Casey, Mattie, and Meghan. His faith, as a Christian, also guides his actions and decisions.

In the halls of the West Virginia House of Delegates, Wayne Clark continues to advocate for the interests of District 99 and the state as a whole. His journey—from the greens of Locust Hill Golf Course to the legislative chambers—is a testament to his dedication and service.
