Brandon Steele, a Republican from Raleigh County, West Virginia, has made significant contributions to both his community and the state legislature. Born on July 12, 1981, in Beckley, West Virginia, Steele grew up in a family that valued public service. His parents, Larry J. Steele and Donna J. Steele, instilled in him a strong work ethic and a commitment to making a difference.

After completing his education, Steele embarked on a diverse professional journey. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps for eight years, demonstrating discipline, leadership, and dedication. Following his military service, he pursued higher education, earning a Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice from Mountain State University and a Juris Doctorate from Marquette University.

Legal Career and Public Service: Steele’s legal career began in 2014 when he became a practicing attorney. His passion for justice and community welfare led him to seek public office. In 2018, he successfully ran for the West Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 29th District. As a legislator, he has been an advocate for conservative values and has actively participated in shaping state policies.

Key Roles and Accomplishments:

Committee Leadership: Steele serves as the Chairman of the Committee on Government Organization. In this role, he plays a crucial part in evaluating and improving government processes and efficiency.
Pro-Life Advocacy: He has been a vocal advocate for pro-life positions. Notably, during debates on the state’s abortion bill (HB 302), Steele opposed exceptions for cases of rape and incest, aligning with his conservative stance.
Personal Life: Steele’s commitment to public service extends beyond the political arena. He is a devoted family man, married to Brianne Steele, and they have five children: Audrey, Lora Beth, Reagan, Owen, and Brooklyn. His Protestant faith also plays an essential role in shaping his values and decisions.
