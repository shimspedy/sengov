Mike Azinger, member of the West Virginia Senate from the 3rd district
Incumbent since December 1, 2016
Serving with Donna Boley

Michael Thomas Azinger is an American politician. He belongs to the Republican Party and has been representing the 3rd district in the West Virginia Senate since January 11, 2017. Prior to his Senate tenure, Azinger served in the West Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 10th District from 2015 to 2017. Interestingly, he succeeded his father, Tom Azinger, in the House of Delegates.

**Early Political Career:**
Before entering West Virginia's legislature, Mike Azinger was a resident of Ohio. He even ran twice for the Sixth Congressional District in Ohio. In 1998, he competed for the Republican nomination but came in third behind Lt. Governor Nancy Hollister and former Congressman Frank Cremeans. In 2000, he secured the Republican nomination but was unsuccessful in his bid to unseat Rep. Ted Strickland, receiving only 40% of the vote.

**Notable Event:**
Azinger was present at the armed insurrection at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. He attended the Stop the Steal rallies, where he claimed to see no evidence of violence. However, both his claims—that the responsible individuals were Antifa and that Trump supporters didn't break into the Capitol—have been widely disputed and proven wrong.
