John Williams, a Democrat hailing from Monongalia County, West Virginia, has dedicated himself to public service. Born on May 24th, 1990, in Morgantown, he grew up in the heart of the Mountain State. His educational journey led him to earn a Bachelor’s Degree from West Virginia University, where he honed his skills and knowledge.

Beyond academia, Williams has made significant contributions to his community. As a financial advisor, he brings his expertise to bear on matters of fiscal policy and economic well-being. But his commitment extends beyond spreadsheets and balance sheets. He’s an active participant in local organizations, including the Rotary and Saint Mary’s Catholic Church. These affiliations reflect his desire to connect with people and make a positive impact.

Williams first stepped into the political arena when he was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 2016. Serving until 2020, he championed the interests of his constituents in District 80. His legislative work touched on issues ranging from education to healthcare, always with an eye toward improving the lives of West Virginians.

Outside the Capitol, Williams wears another hat: that of the Board President for Senior Monongalians. This role underscores his commitment to the well-being of seniors in his community, ensuring they have the support and resources they need.

As a proud Catholic, Williams draws inspiration from his faith, infusing his public service with compassion and empathy. His journey—from Morgantown to the state legislature—serves as a testament to the power of community engagement and the impact one dedicated individual can make.
