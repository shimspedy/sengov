Chris Rose is a Republican serving in the West Virginia State Senate, representing District 2. He assumed office on December 1, 2024, and his current term is set to end on December 1, 2028.

Chris Rose is a fourth-generation coal miner, born and raised in the southern coalfields of Appalachia in McDowell County, West Virginia. Growing up, he witnessed firsthand the economic challenges faced by his community due to government regulations and policies that impacted the coal industry. Despite these challenges, Chris and his family chose to remain in West Virginia, advocating for the coal and gas industries that are vital to the state's economy.

Chris pursued higher education at Bluefield State College, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering Technology in 2012. During his time at college, he began his career in mining, working for the same company where his father and grandfather had been employed. Over the years, he advanced from skilled labor roles to management positions, showcasing his dedication and expertise in the field. Currently, he works as an electrician for a power utility company in a region heavily reliant on coal-fired power.

Chris's journey into politics began during his college years, where he co-founded and served as the first chairman of the Bluefield State College Republicans. His passion for conservative values and constitutional rights led him to actively campaign for candidates who shared his vision. He played a significant role in the Tea Party movement, serving as a regional field director and supporting the campaigns of prominent figures like U.S. Senators Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Ron Johnson. Chris was also a dedicated volunteer for President Donald J. Trump's 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, aligning with policies that aimed to revitalize American industries, including coal.

A staunch advocate for the Second Amendment, Chris is a lifetime member of the NRA and is actively involved with organizations like the West Virginia Citizens Defense League and Gun Owners of America. His commitment to protecting constitutional freedoms is a cornerstone of his political philosophy.

Chris has been married to his wife, Amber, for over a decade. Together, they are active members of their Christian and pro-life communities, championing religious freedom and the sanctity of life. They enjoy exploring the natural beauty of West Virginia, from its majestic mountains to its serene rivers.

As a proud representative of West Virginia's working class, Chris Rose is dedicated to putting the needs of his constituents first. His deep-rooted connection to the state's coal mining heritage and his unwavering commitment to conservative principles have earned him the nickname "West Virginia's Blue-Collar Conservative." Through his work in the State Senate, Chris continues to advocate for policies that support the people and industries of West Virginia.
