A proud Hinton, West Virginia native, Jack David resides in Summers County with his wife Debra Brookman Woodrum. Jack and Debbie have three children, and one grandchild. Jack is the son of the late Dr. Jack D. and Joan Briers Woodrum M.D..

The Woodrum and Briers families have a long history in our communities dating back to the early 1800â€™s. Jack feels fortunate to have been raised in the company of railroaders, carpenters, engineers, farmers, outdoorsmen and medical providers that make up most of his immediate family.

Currently Jack serves as chairman of the Government Organization Committee, Enrolled Bills, and the Legislative Rule-Making Review Committee. In addition to these committees he also serves on the committees for Finance, Rules, Agriculture and Natural Resources, and School Choice.

Jack served as a member of the Summers County Commission for ten years, and served three terms as President. He has worked tirelessly on local, state, and federal legislation, along with education, infrastructure, and economic development issues.

In the private sector Jack David has worked in the funeral service industry since 1981 and he is also a licensed Real Estate Salesperson and Pyrotechnic operator. As a trumpet player Jack David has performed with Military Honor Guards in Summers and surrounding counties for many years honoring the men and women that have served our nation.
