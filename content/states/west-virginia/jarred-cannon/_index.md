Jarred Cannon is a proud West Virginian with deep roots in the Mountain State, tracing back to its founding. A lifelong resident, Cannon graduated from West Virginia University and is a product of the state's public school system. He is currently running to represent Putnam County, District 21, in the State House of Delegates.

Cannon began his political career as the campaign manager for Congressman and Supreme Court Justice Evan Jenkins. He then served as the Victory Director for the West Virginia Republican Party, where he played a key role in helping elect conservative supermajorities across the state. Today, he owns a public relations firm based in West Virginia, focusing on the energy, healthcare, and higher education sectors.

After winning the May primary election, Cannon was honored to be appointed to the State House of Delegates by Governor Jim Justice, representing his community in Charleston since June 2022. In his role, he has been a steadfast advocate for Putnam Countyâ€™s conservative values.

Outside of politics, Cannon is involved with the Lincoln Legacy Foundation and the Ohio-West Virginia Youth Leadership Association (YLA), both non-profits dedicated to providing strong civic education to the next generation of West Virginia students.

Motivated by a desire to make West Virginia and Putnam County the best places to live, work, and raise a family, Cannon is focused on addressing economic challenges and ensuring continued development in the region. His commitment to these goals underscores the critical importance of electing leaders who will drive positive change for the community.
