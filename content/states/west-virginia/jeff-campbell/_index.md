Jeff Campbell was born on February 8th, 1969, in Hinton, West Virginia. His educational journey took him through Greenbrier East High School, and he later pursued higher education at Concord College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Communications. Continuing his academic pursuits, he also obtained a Bachelor of Science in Education from Concord University.

Political Journey Campbell’s political path has been marked by twists and turns. Initially a Democrat, he eventually switched party affiliations to become a Republican. His first stint in the West Virginia House of Delegates began in 2017 when Governor Jim Justice appointed him to represent the 42nd district. During this term, Campbell made his mark as a legislator. However, in the 2020 general election, the district shifted to Republican control, resulting in his loss of the seat.

But Campbell’s story doesn’t end there. In 2023, Governor Justice once again tapped him for public service, this time appointing him to fill a vacancy in the 46th district left by Michael Honaker. Campbell’s commitment to his constituents remains steadfast, and he continues to navigate the complex world of West Virginia politics.

Beyond Politics Beyond the halls of the statehouse, Jeff Campbell wears multiple hats. He is both a schoolteacher and a broadcaster. Many West Virginians may recognize his voice from West Virginia Mountaineers football broadcasts, where he serves as the statistician. Whether in the classroom or behind the microphone, Campbell’s dedication shines through.

Personal Details Campbell’s faith plays an essential role in his life; he identifies as Christian. His parents, the late James W. “Bill” Campbell and Joyce Campbell, undoubtedly influenced his values and sense of duty.

Electoral History In the 2020 Democratic primary for the 42nd House District, Campbell secured victory with 50.9% of the votes. However, despite a competitive race, he lost his seat in the general election due to the district’s shift toward Republican representation. In the 2018 general election, he successfully held on to his seat as a Democrat.

Jeff Campbell’s journey—from educator to broadcaster to legislator—reflects his commitment to serving West Virginia. Whether analyzing game stats or crafting legislation, he continues to make an impact.
