Debbie Law Warner, a dedicated Republican, currently serves as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates from the 82nd district. Her journey into politics began when she was elected on November 8, 2022, and she officially assumed office on December 1, 2022.

## Early Life and Education

Debbie Warner was born in Charleston, West Virginia, a state known for its rugged beauty and strong sense of community. She later made her home in Cheat Lake, West Virginia, where she continues to serve her constituents with unwavering commitment.

Warner's pursuit of knowledge led her to the University of Kentucky, where she earned her Bachelor of Science degree. Her educational background has undoubtedly contributed to her thoughtful approach to policymaking.

## Real Estate and Community Service

Beyond her political role, Debbie Warner wears another hat: that of a respected real estate agent. For over fifteen years, she has been assisting families relocating to the area, helping them find their place in Monongalia County. Her Certified Relocation Specialist designation underscores her expertise in this field.

## Family and Faith

Debbie Warner's personal life is equally remarkable. She is married to Mac Warner, who serves as the Secretary of State of West Virginia. Together, they form a dynamic team committed to public service. Their family includes four children—two sons and two daughters—all proudly serving in the United States Armed Forces. Their shared commitment to country and community runs deep.

Debbie Warner's journey—from Charleston to Cheat Lake, from real estate to the halls of the West Virginia Legislature—exemplifies resilience, dedication, and a heart for service. As a Christian, she brings compassion and integrity to her role, striving to make a positive impact on the lives of those she represents.
