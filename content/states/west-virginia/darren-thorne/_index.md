Born and raised in Hampshire County, West Virginia, Darren Thorne has deep roots in his community. His upbringing on a family farm instilled in him a strong work ethic and a commitment to serving others. Thorne pursued his education locally, graduating from Hampshire High School before attending West Virginia University, where he earned a degree in Agricultural Science.

Before joining the State Senate, Thorne served as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, representing District 89. During his tenure in the House, he gained valuable legislative experience and built a reputation as a pragmatic and results-oriented leader. His appointment to the State Senate in December 2024 by Governor Jim Justice marked a significant milestone in his political career.
