Darren Thorne assumed office on December 1, 2022, and his current term will end on December 1, 2024. He was elected in the general election held on November 8, 2022, and is now seeking re-election in the upcoming general election on November 5, 2024.

Before entering politics, Thorne worked as a farmer. His experiences in agriculture likely inform his legislative priorities and understanding of rural issues.

Within the West Virginia House of Delegates, Thorne serves on several committees:

Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee
House Banking and Insurance Committee
Economic Development Committee
House Education Committee
Fire Departments and Emergency Medical Services Committee
In the 2024 general election, Thorne faces competition from Alyson Reeves (D) for the District 89 seat. The race promises to be closely watched, and voters will decide whether to re-elect Thorne or choose a new representative.

Thorne successfully advanced from the Republican primary held on May 14, 2024. Alyson Reeves secured the Democratic nomination in the same primary.

As a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, Thorne receives a base salary of $20,000 per year. Additionally, he is eligible for per diem payments: $75 per day for members who commute daily and $175 per day for those who do not.
