Adam Vance, a member of the Republican Party, has been serving in the West Virginia House of Delegates since December 1, 2022. His current term will continue until December 1, 2024. Vance is also running for re-election to represent District 35 in the upcoming general election on November 5, 2024.

Born in Beckley, West Virginia, Vance’s roots run deep in the state. He attended Baileysville High School, graduating in the year 2000. His upbringing in the heart of Appalachia undoubtedly influenced his perspective and commitment to public service.

Vance’s professional journey took him underground—literally. He worked as an underground coal miner, an occupation that carries immense significance in West Virginia’s history and culture. The coal industry has shaped the state’s economy and communities for generations, and Vance’s firsthand experience in this demanding field likely informs his legislative priorities.

During the 2023-2024 legislative session, Delegate Vance served on several committees, each with its own focus:

Energy and Manufacturing Committee: Addressing matters related to energy production, industrial processes, and economic development.
Fire Departments and Emergency Medical Services Committee: Ensuring the safety and well-being of West Virginia residents through emergency services.
House Government Organization Committee: Overseeing government operations and organizational matters.
Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee: Advocating for the state’s agricultural sector and responsible management of natural resources.
Vance identifies with the Freewill Baptist tradition. He is married to Patti Vance, and together, they are parents to five children. Beckley remains their hometown—a place that continues to shape their values and aspirations
