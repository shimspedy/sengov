Tom Takubo is a Republican member of the West Virginia Senate, representing the 17th district since January 14, 2015. He also serves as the Majority Leader of the West Virginia Senate, having succeeded Ryan Ferns after the 2018 West Virginia Senate election.

Born on December 14, 1971, in Columbus, Ohio, Takubo's mother hails from Logan County, West Virginia, while his biological father was from Japan. His parents divorced during his childhood, and his mother later remarried. Takubo attended Marshall University and earned his Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree from the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine. He is a business owner and also serves on the medical faculty at West Virginia University.

In the 2018 election, despite being outspent, Takubo secured a second term by defeating Terrell Ellis with a slim 52.5%-47.5% margin. His victory contributed to the Republican wave election that saw the party take control of both chambers of the West Virginia Legislature for the first time in eight decades.

Senator Takubo resides in the Southridge area of South Charleston and is a proud parent of three children: Maggie, Trevor, and Molly.
