Donna Jean Boley (n√©e Northcraft) is a Republican member of the West Virginia Senate, representing the 3rd district. Born on December 9, 1935, in Bens Run, West Virginia, she has dedicated decades to public service.

In 1985, Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr. appointed Boley to fill a vacant Senate seat, which she won in the subsequent election. Since then, she has been re-elected nine times, making her the longest-serving state senator in West Virginia history. Notably, from 1990 to 1996, she served as Senate Minority Leader.

Boley's district includes Pleasants, Wood, Wirt, and part of Roane counties. Her commitment to public service extends beyond the Senate; she has been actively involved in Republican party leadership, serving on committees and as a delegate to national conventions.

Despite the challenges of being the sole Republican in the 34-member Senate during certain years, Boley has consistently championed her constituents' interests. Her legacy reflects dedication, resilience, and a deep commitment to West Virginia.
