Eric Brooks, born on Christmas Eve in 1971 at Beckley Appalachian Regional Hospital, has made his mark as an American politician. He currently serves as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 45th district. Elected on November 8, 2022, he officially assumed office on December 1, 2022.

**Early Life and Education**
Eric's roots run deep in the coal-mining town of Beckley, West Virginia. His parents, David Brooks (a coal miner) and Linda Brooks (an educator), instilled in him a strong work ethic and a commitment to community service. Growing up in this tight-knit community, Eric developed a sense of responsibility and a passion for making a difference.

After graduating from high school, Eric pursued higher education at West Virginia University. In 1994, he proudly earned a Bachelor's degree in Sociology and Anthropology. His academic journey not only broadened his horizons but also laid the foundation for his future public service.

**Career and Service**
Eric's professional journey took an interesting turn when he joined the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1995. For over two decades, he dedicated himself to maintaining safety and order within the correctional system. His commitment to justice and fairness shaped his perspective on governance and community well-being.

Throughout his career, Eric has been affiliated with organizations that share his values. Notably, he has been associated with the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the West Virginia Citizen Defense League. These affiliations reflect his dedication to protecting individual rights and upholding the Constitution.

**Family and Personal Life**
Beyond the political arena, Eric's heart lies with his family. In 1994, he married his high school sweetheart, Jennifer. Together, they have three wonderful children: Clay, Morgan, and Faith. Their shared journey has been one of love, support, and resilience.

Eric's faith plays a significant role in his life. As a Baptist, he draws strength from his spiritual beliefs and seeks to serve his community with compassion and integrity.

**Retirement and New Beginnings**
In 2021, after a fulfilling career with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Eric decided to retire. But retirement didn't mean slowing down; it marked the beginning of a new chapter. Armed with experience, wisdom, and a desire to contribute further, he stepped into the political arena. His victory in the 2022 election affirmed the trust placed in him by the people of the 45th district.

Today, Eric resides in Mount Hope, West Virginia, where he continues to serve his constituents with dedication and a commitment to their well-being. His journey—from coal miner's son to public servant—is a testament to the resilience and spirit of West Virginians.
