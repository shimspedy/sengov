## Early Life and Education
Jordan Ray Bridges was born on March 28, 1988, in Logan, West Virginia. His parents, Bobby and Jackie Bridges, raised him in this picturesque corner of the Appalachian region. Jordan attended Beth Haven Christian School, where he laid the foundation for his future endeavors. Later, he continued his education at Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College.

## From Coal Mines to Capitol Hill
Before entering politics, Jordan Bridges worked in the coal industry—a profession deeply intertwined with West Virginia's history and identity. His firsthand experience as a coal miner gave him unique insights into the challenges faced by communities reliant on this industry.

## Political Journey
### 2018: A First Attempt
In 2018, Bridges threw his hat into the political ring, seeking a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Although he secured the Republican nomination in the primary, the general election proved elusive. Despite his best efforts, Democrats Tim Tomblin and Ralph Rodighiero emerged victorious.

### 2020: Persistence Pays Off
Undeterred, Bridges ran again in 2020. His campaign focused on critical issues:
- **Infrastructure Investment:** Bridges advocated for much-needed investments in West Virginia's infrastructure.
- **Business Regulations:** He championed limited regulations to support local businesses.
- **Taxation:** Bridges aimed for a fairer tax system.
In the primary, he secured the nomination alongside Margitta Mazzocchi. In the general election, Bridges emerged victorious, defeating Tomblin and another Democratic candidate.

## Legislative Impact
As a Delegate, Jordan Bridges has actively participated in shaping West Virginia's policies. His committee assignments include:
- **Agriculture and Natural Resources**
- **Education**
- **Energy and Manufacturing**
- **Workforce Development**
- **Coal Industry Recovery:** Given his background as a former coal miner, Bridges joined a bipartisan workgroup focused on revitalizing communities affected by the decline of the coal industry.

## Controversies
### Transgender Rights
Bridges cosponsored House Bill 3293, which sought to prevent transgender athletes from competing on teams aligned with their gender identity. However, his endorsement of the bill sparked heated debates and criticism due to its potential impact on transgender individuals.

### Worker's Rights
Bridges voted against SB 11, a bill that would have made it more challenging for employees to strike—a decision that drew attention from labor advocates.

## Personal Life
Jordan Bridges is a devoted family man. He is married to Erica Bridges, and together they have two children. His faith plays an essential role in his life, as he identifies as a Christian.
