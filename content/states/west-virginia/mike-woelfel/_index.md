Mike Woelfel is a Democratic member of the West Virginia Senate representing the 5th district. Born on June 21, 1954, in Huntington, West Virginia, he has been serving in the Senate since December 1, 2014. The 5th district encompasses all of Cabell County and a small portion of northern Wayne County.

In 2022, Woelfel was chosen as the Minority Leader of the Senate. Prior to this leadership role, he served as the Minority Whip for the Senate Democratic caucus in 2020. His victory in the 2014 election was a rare pickup for the Democratic Party during a year that saw major Republican gains in West Virginia.

Outside of politics, Woelfel maintains a private personal injury law firm alongside his son, Matthew Woelfel. Before entering the Senate, he worked as an assistant prosecuting attorney in Cabell County and held a part-time position in a juvenile judicial office for the Supreme Court of Appeals. Additionally, he served as an adjunct professor at Marshall University.

Woelfel holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from Marshall University and a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from West Virginia University. He and his wife, Julia, have two children: Michael and Matthew. They are also proud grandparents to Colin, Mady, and Carter.
