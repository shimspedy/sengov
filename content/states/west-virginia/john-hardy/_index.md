John Hardy hails from Martinsburg, West Virginia. Born to parents Bobby and Rosalee Hardy, he grew up in a community steeped in history and tradition. His grandparents, Jim and Irma Stephens, played an influential role in shaping his values and work ethic.

Education and Military Service: John attended Jefferson High School, where he laid the foundation for his future endeavors. However, it was his service in the United States Army that truly shaped him. As a Military Police officer, he contributed to the safety and security of his fellow soldiers and the nation. His expertise extended to communications, ensuring effective information flow within military units.

Business and Community Involvement: John is the proud owner of Stephens Painting & General Contracting, LLC. This family business, established by his grandfather in Berkeley County back in 1945, has been a cornerstone of the community. From a young age, John learned the skills of the trade and imbibed the entrepreneurial spirit necessary to run a successful enterprise. In 1995, when his grandfather retired, John stepped up to lead the family business, continuing its legacy.

Beyond business, John is an active member of various organizations. He participates in service projects and community initiatives through Rotary, supports Second Amendment rights through his involvement with the National Rifle Association (NRA), advocates for responsible gun ownership and individual liberties with the West Virginia Citizens Defense League, and contributes to local economic development as part of the Martinsburg-Berkeley County Chamber of Commerce.

Public Service: John Hardy’s commitment to public service led him to seek political office. He was first elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 2018, representing the 63rd district. His dedication resonated with constituents, and in 2022, he secured victory in the 97th district. On December 1, 2022, he officially assumed office, ready to serve his constituents. John identifies as a Christian, drawing strength and guidance from his faith.

John Hardy’s journey—from military service to business leadership and public office—reflects his dedication to community, family, and the values that define West Virginia.
