Robert Lee Karnes, born on May 13, 1969, hails from South Charleston, West Virginia. He is an American politician known for his controversial and conservative rhetoric. As a Republican, he has been a member of the West Virginia Senate, representing the 11th district.

Senator Karnes first assumed office on January 14, 2015, after defeating incumbent Democrat Senator Greg Tucker in the 2014 electionâ€”a historic moment as it marked the first time in over 80 years that West Virginian Republicans gained control in either the state House or Senate. He continued to serve until 2019 and then returned to the Senate on November 30, 2020.

In the 2020 General Election, Senator Karnes secured re-election by defeating incumbent Republican Senator John Pitsenbarger in the primary and Democrat Denise Campbell in the general election. His victory reaffirmed his commitment to pro-business, pro-jobs, and educational reform agendas.

Notably, during the 2018-19 teacher strikes, Senator Karnes expressed the belief that the strikes "won't have any significant effect." Additionally, he made headlines during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 when he wore a mesh mask in protest of state mask mandates and CDC guidelines while conducting official duties.

Senator Robert Karnes also took a unique stance against the Film Tax Credit, being the sole senator to vote against it, arguing that it would benefit Bette Midler more than West Virginia residents.

Education:
- Poca High School (Class of 1987)

Legislative Positions Held:
- Vice Chair, Committee on Education (83rd Legislature)
- Chair, Committee on Natural Resources (82nd Legislature)

Senator Karnes remains an influential figure in West Virginia politics, leaving a lasting impact on the state's legislative landscape.
