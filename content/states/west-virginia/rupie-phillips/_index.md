Rupert W. "Rupie" Phillips Jr. was born on February 17, 1969, in Man, West Virginia. He's an American politician with a colorful history of party affiliations and a commitment to serving his constituents.

**Early Career:**
- Phillips first entered the political arena as a Democrat, winning a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 2010. He represented both the 19th and 24th Districts during his tenure.
- In 2016, after the elections, he switched his party registration from Democrat to Independent.
- A few months later, Phillips made another pivot, becoming a Republican. He even ran for the Third Congressional District seat, which was being vacated by then-Representative Evan Jenkins in 2018. However, he finished second in the primary behind future Congresswoman Carol Miller.

**Senate Journey:**
- Undeterred by his unsuccessful congressional bid, Phillips set his sights on the West Virginia Senate. In 2020, he ran as the Republican nominee for the 7th Senate District.
- In the general election, he faced off against then-Democratic Delegate Ralph Rodighiero and emerged victorious, securing his place in the state Senate.
- As a senator, Phillips has continued to advocate for his constituents and their interests.

**Quirks and Controversies:**
- Phillips graduated from Man High School, and his commitment to the coal industry is evident. His personal vehicle once bore the license plate "COALDEL," signifying his support for coal delegates.
- Notably, he made national headlines when he handed out bottles of sunscreen to fellow Delegates on the House floor to mock global warming.
- However, he faced some ridicule when he didn't realize that power plants using coal and natural gas must go offline in extremely cold temperatures due to frozen water cooling inlets.

**Election Results:**
- In the 2020 West Virginia Senate election, Phillips secured victory with 56.2% of the votes, defeating his Democratic opponent, Ralph Rodighiero.
- During the 2018 Republican primary for the Third Congressional District, he finished second behind Carol Miller.

Senator Rupie Phillips continues to serve West Virginia with his unique blend of determination, humor, and commitment to the coal industry.
