Patricia Rucker, born Patricia Elena Puertas on April 27, 1974, in Caracas, Venezuela, is a Republican member of the West Virginia Senate. She has represented the 16th district since January 11, 2017. Rucker made history as the first Hispanic woman to represent West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle. Her journey to the United States began when she emigrated from Venezuela with her parents at the age of 6, eventually becoming a U.S. citizen in 2004.

Before entering politics, Rucker was a teacher and actively involved in community organizations. She co-founded and served as the president of "We the People of West Virginia-Jefferson County." Currently, she balances her legislative duties with raising and homeschooling her five children alongside her husband of 25 years.
