Kathy Edmonston is an American politician currently serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. She represents District 88 and is a member of the Republican Party. She assumed office on January 13, 2020.

Edmonston has been noted to spread false information regarding vaccination and has unsuccessfully tried to pass legislation to make it difficult for schools to enforce vaccination mandates in Louisiana. Despite these controversies, she has made significant contributions to her district and the state of Louisiana.

Before her tenure in the House of Representatives, Edmonston was a member of the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education representing District 6 from 2016 to 2020. This experience in education has played a significant role in shaping her political career.

In addition to her political career, Edmonston has also worked as a parent facilitator for the Ascension Parish school system, a position she had held since 1994. Her prior experience includes time spent on the Children's Cabinet Advisory Board, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education's Special Education Advisory Board, and the ADHD Task Force.

Edmonston was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and she is a Christian by faith. She holds a Bachelor's degree in English from Louisiana State University. Her commitment to her faith and education has been a guiding force in her life and career.

Throughout her political career, Edmonston has served on various committees including the Administration of Criminal Justice Committee, Judiciary Committee, and the Transportation, Highways and Public Works Committee. Her work on these committees has allowed her to influence legislation and policy in a variety of areas.

Edmonston won re-election to the Louisiana House of Representatives to represent District 88 outright in the primary on October 14, 2023, after the general election was canceled. Her current term ends on January 10, 2028.
