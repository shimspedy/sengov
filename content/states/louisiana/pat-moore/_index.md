Patricia Moore, commonly known as Pat Moore, is an American politician from the state of Louisiana. She is a member of the Democratic Party and represents the 17th district in the Louisiana House of Representatives, which covers parts of Ouachita Parish.

Moore is originally from Monroe, Louisiana. She attended Julia C. Wossman High School and later earned a Bachelor of Arts from the College of Business at the University of Louisiana at Monroe. Before entering politics, Moore had a career at State Farm from which she is now retired.

Moore's political career began when she served on the Ouachita Parish Police Jury between 2007 and 2019, representing District F. She was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 2019 after Marcus Hunter was elected Judge of Louisiana's 4th Judicial District Court. Moore won the March 30, 2019 special election with a significant majority of the vote over Rodney McFarland.

In her tenure as a representative, Moore has been assigned to several committees. These include the Health and Welfare Committee, the Transportation, Highways and Public Works Committee, and the Medicaid Oversight Committee. Her work in these committees has been instrumental in shaping policies and legislation in the state of Louisiana.

Moore's current term in the Louisiana House of Representatives began in 2019 and is set to end on January 10, 2028. She won re-election to represent District 17 outright in the primary on October 14, 2023, after the primary and general election were canceled. This victory solidified her position and influence in the Louisiana House of Representatives.

Throughout her political career, Moore has shown a commitment to serving her constituents and working towards the betterment of Louisiana. Her dedication and hard work continue to make a significant impact on the state's legislative landscape.
