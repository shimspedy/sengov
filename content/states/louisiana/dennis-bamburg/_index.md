Dennis Bamburg Jr. is a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, representing District 5. He assumed office on January 8, 2024, and his current term ends on January 10, 2028. Bamburg is a member of the Republican Party.

Bamburg won election to the Louisiana House of Representatives to represent District 5 outright in the primary on October 14, 2023, after the primary and general election were canceled. This marked a significant milestone in his political career.

Before his tenure in the Louisiana House of Representatives, Bamburg served on the Bossier Parish School Board District 12. His commitment to public service is evident in his previous roles and his current position.

Born and raised in Louisiana, Bamburg graduated from Parkway High School in 1989. He then went on to earn a bachelor's degree in marketing from Northeast Louisiana University in 1994. His educational background laid a solid foundation for his future endeavors.

In addition to his political career, Bamburg is a business owner. He owns an Allstate Insurance Agency. His experience in the business world has undoubtedly contributed to his understanding of the economic landscape and the needs of his constituents.

Bamburg's personal life has also been marked by tragedy. His mother, Earline Bamburg, was brutally murdered in a grisly incident in 1963. The event had a profound impact on Bamburg and his family, shaping his perspective and fueling his commitment to serving his community.

Throughout his career, Bamburg has demonstrated a dedication to his district and a commitment to upholding the values of his party. His work in the Louisiana House of Representatives continues to have a significant impact on his constituents and the state of Louisiana.
