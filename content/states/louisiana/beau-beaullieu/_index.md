Gerald "Beau" Beaullieu IV is an American politician serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from the 48th district. He was elected in November 2019 and assumed office on January 13, 2020.

Beau Beaullieu is a conservative small businessman and lifelong resident of Iberia Parish. He believes in smaller government, less regulation and that fixing our budget problems can be done without putting unnecessary burdens on the back of our hardworking families.

Beau is the oldest son of Buster and Mary Beaullieu and is married to Kaci Smith Beaullieu. The couple has four beautiful children in which they are extremely proud. Beau’s main ambition is creating the kind of state where his children and all of our children can grow up and raise their families without having to leave the state in search of better opportunities.

Beau graduated from LSU with a degree in finance and received his MBA from The University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He is managing partner of CoSource Financial Group, LLC, a financial service firm who specializes in the establishment and maintenance of corporate retirement plans. Beau was one of Louisiana’s first financial advisors to receive the Certified 401(k) Professional designation and is also an Accredited Investment Fiduciary.

In his political career, Beau served as vice chair of the House Retirement Committee until becoming vice chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. He has been a managing partner of the CoSource Financial Group since 2001.

In addition to his political and business careers, Beau has been recognized for his civic service. He has received accolades such as the 2018 Outstanding Civic Service Award by the Greater Iberia Chamber of Commerce and the 2017 Kiwanian of the Year by the New Iberia Kiwanis Club. He is also a member of several organizations including the Iberia Parish Republican Executive Committee, CCA, Ducks Unlimited, LOGA, LABI, Iberia Industrial Foundation, Iberia Chamber of Commerce, and Knights of Columbus 11793.
