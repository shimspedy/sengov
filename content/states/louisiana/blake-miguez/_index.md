Blake John Miguez, born in November 1981, is a Republican member of the Louisiana Senate. He assumed office on January 8, 2024. His current term ends on January 10, 2028.

Before his tenure in the Senate, he served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from Iberia and Vermilion parishes. He won a special election against John Robert Bering on February 21, 2015, to succeed Simone B. Champagne, who resigned to become the chief administrative officer for the city of Youngsville in Lafayette Parish.

Miguez is a graduate of Catholic High School of New Iberia, Louisiana State University, and Southern University Law School. He resides in New Iberia, Louisiana. He is an Executive in the Oil & Gas industry and a corporate attorney licensed in the State of Louisiana.

Miguez started shooting with his father at a local range at an early age. He started at USPSA and the International Practical Shooting Confederation when he was twelve years old. He started practicing with a Beretta 92F and became a Grand Master at the age of seventeen.

In 2010, in Top Shot competition, Miguez competed as part of the Blue Team. His team ended up winning six challenges. He was never nominated for elimination during that period. He was eliminated during the first week of the final half of the competition. During one episode of the second season of the show, Miguez appeared with J.J. Racaza as trainers for one of the challenges.

In 2011, Miguez won his fourth consecutive title at the USPSA Area 4 Handgun Championship, and his seventh title in that tournament since 2003. In 2013, Miguez appeared on Top Shot (season 5).
