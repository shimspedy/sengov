Born and raised in Turkey Creek, Louisiana, Butler attended Bayou Chicot High School in nearby Ville Platte. After completing her schooling, she graduated from the Bolton Beauty College.

Butler's political career began when she was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in January 2020. During her tenure, she has sponsored several pieces of legislation. In November 2020, she sponsored legislation that would require the Louisiana Department of Health to set rules granting family members increased access to residents of nursing homes and other adult residential care facilities.

In May 2021, Butler was one of 48 House members who voted against a bill that would tax the sale of marijuana in Louisiana, effectively killing efforts to legalize recreational marijuana in the state.
