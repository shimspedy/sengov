Alan Thomas Seabaugh is an American attorney from Shreveport, Louisiana, who is a Republican member of the Louisiana Senate from District 31. He previously served as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from District 5 in Caddo Parish.

Alan Seabaugh has been a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives since 2010. He currently serves on the House Ways and Means, Insurance, and Labor Committees as well as the Joint Legislative Committee on the Capital Outlay. In 2012, he was elected Vice Chairman of the Louisiana House Republican delegation.

Seabaugh is the managing partner of Seabaugh, Joffrion, Sepulvado & Victory law firm. The practice includes insurance defense and claims, contracts, real estate law, property law, and all areas of civil and commercial litigation. He also is a member of the Louisiana Supreme Court Committee on Bar Admissions.

Seabaugh was a delegate and vice chairman of the Louisiana delegation to the 2008 Republican National Convention held in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was also a member of the Electoral College that year. He cast his two votes for the unsuccessful McCain / Palin ticket. He was a delegate to the 2010 Southern Republican Leadership Conference which convened in New Orleans.

He has been affiliated with the Christian nationalist legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom, which is noted for its opposition to LGBTQ rights.

In 2007, Seabaugh unsuccessfully challenged Republican State Senator Sherri Smith Buffington. Seabaugh said that Cheek (now Buffington) "runs as a Republican and votes like a Democrat", and that he was disturbed that people from Caddo Parish had left Louisiana to seek economic opportunity elsewhere. Cheek won with fifty-seven percent of the vote.

Seabaugh was elected to the legislature in 2010 to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of Republican Wayne Waddell. In the 2010 election, Seabaugh defeated Republican and Red River Bank president Harold Turner 57-43 percent. In the primary election held on October 22, 2011, Seabaugh defeated fellow Republican and former Shreveport City Councilwoman Cynthia Norton Robertson, receiving 79.3% of the vote.

In the October 24, 2015 primary election, Seabaugh won reelection to the House 71-29 percent, defeating Democrat Eileen Velez of Shreveport.

In 2013, Seabaugh was strongly encouraged to enter the upcoming 2014 U.S. Senate Race against U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat who unsuccessfully sought a fourth term in the office.
