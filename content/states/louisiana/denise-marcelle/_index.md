Denise Marcelle is a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 61 in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. She succeeded her fellow Democrat Alfred C. Williams, who passed away while in office on August 4, 2015.

Marcelle won the right to succeed Williams by defeating a single opponent, her fellow Democrat Donna Collins-Lewis, in the primary election held on October 24, 2015. Marcelle and the late State Representative Ronnie Edwards of District 29 both served on the Baton Rouge Metro-Council prior to their elections in 2015 to the state House. Edwards passed away in early 2016 of pancreatic cancer less than two months after taking office.

In 2016, Marcelle ran for the position of mayor-president of Baton Rouge and the East Baton Rouge Parish, but was unsuccessful. She is an alumnus of Capitol High School in Baton Rouge.

Marcelle has been serving as the Louisiana State Representative for District 61 since October 2016. She was re-elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives to represent District 61 outright in the primary on October 14, 2023, after the primary and general election were canceled.

As of March 2020, Marcelle resided in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She graduated from Capital Senior High School. Marcelle earned a bachelor of arts in criminal justice from Southern University. Her career experience includes working as the Director of Community Outreach with Attorney Gordon McKernan, Injury Attorneys.

Marcelle has been assigned to several committees during her tenure, including the Administration of Criminal Justice Committee, Appropriations Committee, Municipal, Parochial and Cultural Affairs Committee, and the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.
