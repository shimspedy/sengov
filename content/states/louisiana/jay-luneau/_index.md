Wendell Jay Luneau, known as Jay Luneau or W. Jay Luneau, is an American politician from Pineville, Louisiana. A Democrat, Luneau has represented District 29 in the Louisiana State Senate since 2016. He is currently running for re-election.

Before entering elected office, Luneau opened the Luneau Law Office in Alexandria. Still in operation, the law office represents small businesses and individuals in workers compensation, personal injury, and damage claims cases.

Luneau won 59.34% of the vote in the October 24, 2015 jungle primary over Republican Joseph Dara. Winning re-election on October 12, 2019, Luneau received 61.46% of votes in the primary election, against Republican opponent Randy Wiggins.

Luneau, an adjunct professor at Northwestern State University and former magistrate judge in Ball, first ran for elected office after predecessor Rick Gallot declined to run for re-election to spend more time with his family.

In addition to his political career, Luneau is also an attorney. He is the owner of Luneau Law Office in Alexandria, where he represents individuals and small businesses in a wide variety of cases in the areas of personal injury, workerâ€™s compensation, and other damage claims in courts throughout the state.

His current term ends on January 10, 2028. He has been assigned to various committees during his tenure, including the Health & Welfare Committee, Judiciary A Committee, Labor & Industrial Relations Committee, Revenue & Fiscal Affairs Committee, and Joint Capital Outlay Committee.
