Patrick McMath is an American politician, businessman, and attorney from the state of Louisiana. He is a member of the Republican party and has been representing the 11th district in the Louisiana State Senate since 2020.

Before his tenure in the Senate, McMath worked as an assistant district attorney and started several businesses. In 2017, he was elected as an at-large city councilman in his hometown of Covington. Two years later, he ran for State Senate, defeating State Representative Reid Falconer in the runoff election with 56% of the vote.

McMath is not only dedicated to his work in the Senate but also to serving his community. He volunteers on the boards of several organizations, including the West Saint Tammany Chamber of Commerce, the Boys and Girls Club of Covington, and the Kelly Gibson Foundation. He is committed to leaving a stronger Louisiana for future generations.

A graduate of Louisiana State University, McMath earned his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and a Juris Doctorate from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law. Before entering politics, he served as an assistant district attorney in Louisiana's 22nd Judicial District Court.

Outside of his political and professional pursuits, McMath finds his greatest joy in his family life. He is proud to call himself a husband to his wife Jayne and a father to his four children, Mary Michael, Margaux, George, and Mae.
