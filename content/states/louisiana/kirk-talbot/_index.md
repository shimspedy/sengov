Michael Kirk Talbot, born on November 18, 1969, is an American politician from Louisiana. He is a member of the Republican Party. Talbot has been representing the 10th district in the Louisiana State Senate since 2020. Prior to this, he represented the 78th district in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 2008 to 2020.

Education:
Talbot attended Saint Martin's Episcopal School in his native Metairie in Jefferson Parish. He holds an undergraduate degree in business administration from the University of Mississippi at Oxford.

Political Career:
Talbot was first elected in the 2007 general election against Harahan Councilwoman Tiffany Scot Wilken to replace the term-limited District 78 Representative Shirley D. Bowler, a Republican who had served since 1992. Talbot is a proponent of reduced spending by Louisiana government, specifically naming higher education as an area ripe for cutting. In a June 15, 2009, letter to the editor of the Times-Picayune (New Orleans), Talbot explicitly opposed 2009 Louisiana Senate Bill 335 by Senator Lydia P. Jackson of Shreveport and criticized the increased rate of state spending for higher education over the last 10 years.

Personal Life:
Talbot and his wife, the former Julie Strong, have a daughter and a son. The Talbots, part owners of Lucky Dogs Inc., are involved in various business-related organizations in Jefferson Parish. For one year in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Talbot worked for Fannie Mae.
