Aimee Adatto Freeman is an American politician and business consultant serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from the 98th district. She was elected in November 2019 and assumed office on January 13, 2020, succeeding Neil Abramson.

Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Freeman is a member of the Democratic Party. She is married to West and they have four children together.

Freeman earned a Bachelor of Arts in English: American Studies from the University of Virginia and a Master of Business Administration in Marketing from the A.B. Freeman School of Business at Tulane University. She worked as a business consultant before entering politics.

Freeman ran for the Louisiana House in the 2019 Louisiana elections. She came first in the nonpartisan primary election in October 2019 and defeated attorney Kea Sherman in the November run-off election. She assumed office on January 13, 2020.

In her role as a state legislator, Freeman sits on the Appropriations Committee, the House Education Committee, the House Retirement Committee, and the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. She has successfully passed landmark legislation, such as laws that ended the Pink Tax on menstrual products and children and adult diapers, serve survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence, and streamline the Pandemic-EBT distribution process, which led to 250,000 more families receiving benefits.

Freeman has also served as an Adjunct Professor of business at Tulane University for more than two decades and is a member of the board of the A.B. Freeman School Business Council. She has spearheaded neighborhood improvements by founding the Maple Quality of Life Committee and is a member of the Bureau of Governmental Research, where she served on the Board of Directors from 2006-11 and helped manage a successful $3 million endowment campaign. She is also an active member of both the Association for Corporate Growth Louisiana Chapter and the Womenâ€™s Professional Council of Greater New Orleans.

With a B.A. from the University of Virginia and an M.B.A. from Tulane University as well as over 25 years of professional experience, Freeman is well qualified to handle any and every challenge that comes her way.
