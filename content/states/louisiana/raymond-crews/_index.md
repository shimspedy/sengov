Raymond J. Crews is a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from the 8th district. He assumed office in April 2017, succeeding Mike Johnson.

Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, Crews' family moved to the Northeast, where he completed his high school education. He holds a bachelor's degree in computer science from Texas A&M University.

Crews has a distinguished military career, having spent 17 years in the U.S. Air Force, with 9 years in active duty which included combat operations in Iraq. He also served 8 years in the Air Force Reserve, during which he was a pilot for B-52 bombers and took part in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

After leaving active duty, Crews became an airline pilot and flew B-727, DC-9, and A-320 civilian aircraft for 17 years. Today, he operates small businesses, including an Aerial Mapping Service named "Infrared Services LLC" and a small business consulting on building energy performance named "The Green Home Advantage LLC". He holds 33% percent of the stakes of each company. In 2016, Crews has been a full-time employee Delta Air Lines as a pilot and worked for Diabetes Assessment & Management Centers part-time.

Crews is a Christian conservative, with respect to both social and fiscal aspects. He believes in the right to life starting at conception and believes that the United States were founded on the basis of Judeo-Christian principles, of which the Constitutions rights are a result. He supports the view that being an American presupposes the recognition of those rights, the acknowledgement of the inherent dignity and the freedom of religion of each individual. Crews defends the right to bear arms and stands for a strong national security, through the support of U.S. troops, a well-financed military and an improved cyber security infrastructure. Part of his fight for personal freedom is the conviction that a small government with limited tax burdens for the citizens is the best way of promoting a good business climate with quality jobs for his constituency, and also the U.S. as a whole.

On April 29, 2017, Crews defeated his competitor Robbie Gatti, the brother of State Senator Ryan Gatti, a Baptist minister and retired physical therapist by a vote of 64 to 36 percent. Crews was sworn in May 10, 2017, to represent District 8 in Louisiana's House of Representatives at Baton Rouge, replacing Republican Mike Johnson after Johnson was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2016. He was sworn in by former House District 8 legislator and current Louisiana 26th Judicial Court Judge Jeff R. Thompson. During the event, Crews said that he wanted to be among the "defenders of liberty in the political realm", realizing the great potential of the people and natural resources of Louisiana.
