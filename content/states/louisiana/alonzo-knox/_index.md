Alonzo Knox is an American politician and businessman currently serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for the 93rd district. He assumed office on March 25, 2023.

Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Knox graduated from Glen Oaks High School. He furthered his education by earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and law enforcement from Southern University. He also holds a Master of Business Administration from Trinity Washington University.

Knox has a distinguished military background, having served in the United States Marine Corps from 1989 to 2006. After leaving the Marines, Knox worked as a readjustment analyst for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. This role involved helping veterans adjust to civilian life after their military service.

In addition to his political career and military service, Knox is a successful businessman. He founded the Backatown Coffee Parlour on Basin Street in New Orleans, a popular local establishment.

Before his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, Knox was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat on the New Orleans City Council in 2021. However, he did not let this setback deter him. In 2023, he ran in a special election for the Louisiana House of Representatives and was victorious.

Knox's election to the Louisiana House of Representatives was a significant achievement. He won the election outright by receiving more than 50 percent of the vote. This victory was a testament to his popularity and the trust that the people of the 93rd district have in him.

As a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, Knox is committed to serving his constituents and making a positive impact on his community. His tenure in office is marked by his dedication to public service and his commitment to improving the lives of the people in his district.
