Stephanie Berault is a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, representing District 76. She is a member of the Republican Party. She assumed office on January 8, 2024, and her current term ends on January 10, 2028.

Berault won election to the Louisiana House of Representatives to represent District 76 outright in the primary on October 14, 2023, after the general election was canceled. She was a district-level delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention from Louisiana. Because Rubio suspended his campaign in March 2016, however, Berault attended the convention as an uncommitted delegate. Including former Rubio delegates, Louisiana sent a total of ten uncommitted delegates to the national convention.

Stephanie Berault's professional experience includes working as the executive director of the Louisiana chapter of The HeartGift Foundation. She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Southern Mississippi in 2003.

In the 2023 elections, all candidates competed in the same primary, and a candidate could win the election outright by receiving more than 50 percent of the vote. If no candidate did, the top two vote recipients from the primary advanced to the general election, regardless of their partisan affiliation. Stephanie Berault won election outright against Shawn Jones in the primary for Louisiana House of Representatives District 76 on October 14, 2023. She received 79.4 percent of the votes, a total of 6,674 votes.
