Gerald Boudreaux is an American politician who hails from Lafayette, Louisiana. He is affiliated with the Democratic Party and has been representing District 24 in the Louisiana State Senate since 2016.

Before entering elected office, Boudreaux served as the director of Parks and Recreation in Lafayette, Louisiana, a position he held until his resignation in 2020. His resignation came after Mayor-President of Lafayette, Josh Guillory, imposed a 35% budget cut on his department over two years.

Boudreaux is an active member of several boards, including the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame, Miles Perret Cancer Services Center, Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Committee. On August 7, 2023, Boudreaux announced his candidacy for re-election to the Louisiana State Senate.

In the 2015 Louisiana State Senate election, Boudreaux emerged victorious in the 24th Senatorial District as a Democratic Party candidate, securing 26.10% of the votes. In the 2019 Louisiana State Senate election, Boudreaux was re-elected as a Democratic Party candidate in the 24th Senatorial District, securing 75.50% of the votes.

Before his political career, Boudreaux served as an NCAA College Basketball Official from 1984 to 2006. He later became the supervisor of Men's Basketball Officials for the Southeastern Conference from 2006 to 2013. Boudreaux officiated five Final Four games and the championship games of 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003.
