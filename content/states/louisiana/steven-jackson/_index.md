Steven Jackson is an American politician who represents the 2nd district of the Louisiana House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 8, 2024. His current term ends on January 10, 2028.

Before his tenure in the state legislature, Jackson was a member of the Caddo Parish Commission. During his time as a commissioner, he pleaded guilty to impersonating an officer. Despite this, his political career continued to flourish.

In the nonpartisan primary election for the 2nd district of the Louisiana House of Representatives held on October 14, 2023, Jackson defeated Terence Vinson, winning 51 percent of the votes. The general election was canceled as Jackson won outright in the primary.

Apart from his political career, Jackson has professional experience in healthcare. He is an alumnus of Grambling State University and earned a graduate degree from Louisiana State University-Shreveport in 2012.

As a member of the Democratic Party, Jackson is committed to serving his constituents in District 2 and working towards the betterment of Louisiana.
