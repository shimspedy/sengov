Stewart Cathey Jr. was born on April 19, 1981, in Monroe, Louisiana. He is an American politician and businessman from the state of Louisiana. A member of the Republican party, Cathey has represented the 33rd district of the Louisiana State Senate, covering Monroe and surrounding areas, since 2020.

After graduating from high school, Senator Cathey enrolled in the University of Louisiana at Monroe. In 2003, he continued his family’s legacy of service by joining the US Army. As a commissioned officer and Army Engineer, Senator Cathey has served multiple tours for his country. He was mobilized with the Army Corps of Engineers as part of the cleanup efforts following Hurricane Katrina. Senator Cathey was later deployed to Afghanistan, where he oversaw $250 million in infrastructure development projects. In 2016, Senator Cathey volunteered again to serve our country with a second deployment to Afghanistan, where he served as a mentor to Afghan military leaders.

After both of Senator Cathey’s deployments to Afghanistan, he returned home to Northeast Louisiana. Although his work abroad opened many different job opportunities across the globe, he knew Northeast Louisiana was where he belonged. Senator Cathey started out working in business development for a local manufacturer. Eventually, his entrepreneurial spirit led him to open his small business focused on management consulting.

Senator Cathey continues to be an active small businessman and member of the local community. He loves his home and home state, and like many of us, Senator Cathey is concerned about our future. One of the earliest truths Senator Cathey learned growing up was the importance of education. A strong education system is the foundation of a prosperous and vibrant community. Senator Cathey has the experience and energy to tackle the tough circumstances that face our area and our state. He has brought a fresh vision and common-sense approach to the table. Senator Cathey has consistently stood up for all of District 33. He looks forward to continuing to shape the future of this state and to stand Louisiana back up for this generation as well as future generations.

Senator Cathey and his wife, Brittany Wiley Cathey, were married one year ago and reside in Monroe, Louisiana. Their Christian values remain at the forefront of their marriage.
