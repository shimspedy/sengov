Muscarello is a dedicated public servant who has been serving in the Louisiana House of Representatives since April 3, 2018. His current term ends on January 10, 2028. He was re-elected to represent District 86 in the primary on October 14, 2023.

In his tenure, Muscarello has been assigned to several committees. For the years 2023-2024, he was assigned to the Administration of Criminal Justice Committee, Civil Law and Procedure Committee, and Judiciary Committee. He held similar assignments in the years 2021-2022 and 2019-2020.

Muscarello has been known for his stance on certain issues. He voted for and supports an extreme draft Louisiana state bill that would make in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments and some forms of birth control a crime, and prosecute women who get abortions for murder. The draft bill intentionally has no exceptions for rape, incest, or the protection of the life of the mother and would likely also criminalize miscarriages.

Before his political career, Muscarello was an attorney and a small business owner. He received his Bachelor's degree from Southeastern Louisiana University and his JD from Southern University Law Center.
