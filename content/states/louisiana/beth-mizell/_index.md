Mary Beth Sherman Mizell, known as Beth Mizell, is a businesswoman from Franklinton, Louisiana. She is a Republican member of the Louisiana State Senate for District 12, which encompasses the parishes of St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Washington, part of the Florida Parishes of southeastern Louisiana.

Born in January 1952 in Bogalusa, Louisiana, Mizell has been a lifelong resident of the Northshore. She has been a successful business owner for over 30 years, spending her career in early childhood education and development. She was married to James Robert "Bob" Mizell for forty-one years before he died from cancer in 2012. Mizell has two children, Julie Mizell Stewart, a teacher, and Joshua Mizell, a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps.

Mizell won the state Senate position in the general election held on November 21, 2015, when she defeated the Democrat Mickey Murphy. In 2011, Mizell had a strong showing for the Senate against Ben Nevers, but ultimately lost. She finished with 14,764 votes (49.4 percent) to his 15,116 (50.6 percent).

In the Senate, Mizell serves on the Senate committees on Education, Retirement, Commerce, Consumer Protection, and International Affairs. She is also the vice chair of the select committees of Vocational and Technical Education and Women and Children. The National Rifle Association rated Mizell 86 percent in 2015, based on her campaign promises.

In 2020, Mizell was elected to Senate Pro Tempore by her Senate peers. She is a mother, grandmother, businesswoman, and cattle rancher who lives in Franklinton. Her background as a Court Appointed Special Advocate for Children (CASA) and a business owner have been major influences.
