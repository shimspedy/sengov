James "Jimmy" Harris III is an American politician from New Orleans, Louisiana. Born in 1973 or 1974, he is a member of the Democratic Party. Harris has represented District 4 in the Louisiana State Senate since 2020; he previously represented District 99 in the Louisiana House of Representatives between 2016 and 2020.

Before entering elected office, Harris worked as an aide for U.S. Representative Cedric Richmond, as well as working for several other elected officials in the state. With Richmond's backing, he ran in 2015 for District 99 in the Louisiana House of Representatives. Harris defeated Markeita Prevost and Ray Crawford after two rounds of voting.

In 2019, Harris announced that he would run for District 4 in the Louisiana State Senate, which was vacated by Wesley Bishop, Harris' predecessor in the House. Harris was elected with no opponents from either party. In 2023, Jimmy Harris was re-elected to his position as a member of the Louisiana State Senate, representing District 4. He ran unopposed, securing another term in office.

Harris is a true New Orleans native son and a graduate of St. Augustine High School. He received his Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Morehouse College and earned his Juris Doctorate from Southern University Law Center. He has served on various committees during his tenure, including the Commerce, Consumer Protection, and International Affairs Committee, Finance Committee, Judiciary A Committee, Joint Legislative Budget Committee, Medicaid Oversight Committee, and Select Committee on Louisiana Economic Recovery.

Throughout his political career, Harris has shown dedication and commitment to his constituents, working tirelessly to represent their interests in the Louisiana State Senate.
