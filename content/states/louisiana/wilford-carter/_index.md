Wilford Dan Carter Sr. is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from the 34th district, representing Calcasieu Parish. He assumed office on January 10, 2020.

Before his political career, Carter was a judge of the 14th Judicial District (Division F) in Calcasieu Parish for 21 years. He was first elected to this position on October 3, 1992, and took office in 1993. He then retired on November 1, 2013.

In the political arena, Carter first ran for District 34 of the Louisiana House of Representatives as a Democratic candidate in 2015. However, it was not until October 12, 2019, that Carter and Kevin Guidry advanced to a runoff for the District 34 seat, defeating Matilda Green Miller. He went on to win the election, receiving 57.2% of the vote over Guidry's 42.8%.

Carter won re-election to the Louisiana House of Representatives outright in the primary on October 14, 2023, with 62% of the vote, again defeating Guidry. His current term ends on January 10, 2028.

Throughout his tenure, Carter has been assigned to various committees including the Civil Law and Procedure Committee and the House and Governmental Affairs Committee. His contributions and dedication to his role have made him a significant figure in the Louisiana House of Representatives.
