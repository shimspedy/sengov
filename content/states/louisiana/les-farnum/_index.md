Les Farnum is an American politician serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from the 33rd district. He was elected in November 2019 and assumed office on January 13, 2020.

Born in Sulphur, Louisiana, Farnum graduated from the Sowela Technical Community College. Before his political career, Farnum was a union electrician. He then worked as an energy consultant for Power and Control Systems in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was a power systems supervisor at Phillips 66 from 2008 to 2013. He was also a manager at Sasol.

Farnum was an unsuccessful candidate for the Louisiana House of Representatives in 2018, losing to incumbent Republican Stuart Moss. However, Farnum defeated Moss in a rematch election in 2019 and assumed office in January 2020.

In the most recent election, Farnum won re-election to the Louisiana House of Representatives to represent District 33 outright in the primary on October 14, 2023, after the primary and general election were canceled.

Farnum has been assigned to several committees during his tenure, including the House and Governmental Affairs Committee, Municipal, Parochial and Cultural Affairs Committee, Ways and Means Committee, and Joint Capital Outlay Committee.

His current term ends on January 10, 2028.
