Lawrence A. "Larry" Bagley Jr., known as Larry Bagley, was born on January 4, 1949. He is a Republican member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 7, which encompasses Caddo, DeSoto, and Sabine parishes in northwestern Louisiana.

Larry Bagley has been involved in education, retiring after 44 years. Most of those years have been as a coach and Assistant Principal. He is certainly no stranger to the people of the State Representative, District 7, having dedicated 44 years to teaching, and being an active participant in the local governmental and civic organizations.

He has served two terms as a Logansport City Councilman, is the former President of the DeSoto Parish Teachers Association, and served as the President of the Louisiana Association of Basketball Coaches. He is the manager and co-owner of Bagley Farms in Longstreet, his family business since birth, with oil, gas and timber the primary revenue sources.

Larry is also the owner and operator of Bagley Allstate Insurance of DeSoto Parish, and he is keenly aware of the everyday struggles of a small business. Larry Bagley will continue the long tradition of fair and hard working representation to the agriculture, business owners, and well-being of all the citizens of our communities.

He is a member of the DeSoto Parish Chamber of Commerce, NRA, and a former member of the River City Fest Committee. As a Republican, he believes in the conservative principles that have made our country, farms, and neighborhoods great. All his life his parents have inspired him with a strong work ethic and conservative values. He is a churchgoer that lives by his faith.

He is an active member of the First United Methodist Church of Logansport; has served as a former lay leader there, and at the North Point United Methodist Church of Blanchard. He is a strong champion of individual freedoms, and he will protect the rights of gun owners and hunters.

He wants to be a State Representative you can talk to, because he learned from his educational experience that being available to talk with parents and children is the best way to resolve situations. He will hold the line on taxes and spending and fight to bring tax dollars to our district.

Larry Bagley can be counted on to stand up for a better education, protecting teacher retirement, continue the struggle against drugs and crime in our communities, and carry on the effort to keep our roads in good condition. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Baptist Christian College of Shreveport in Elementary Education, a Master of Education degree from Stephen F. Austin University, and +30 from Northwestern Louisiana University.
