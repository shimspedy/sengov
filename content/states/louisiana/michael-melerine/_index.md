Before his tenure in the House of Representatives, Melerine served on the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in District 4. His wife, Stacey Melerine, succeeded him in this position after he moved on to the House of Representatives.

Melerine's journey into politics was marked by a successful election campaign. He won the election to represent the 6th district in the Louisiana House of Representatives on October 14, 2023. He secured a decisive victory, garnering 68.1% of the vote. His competitors, Robert Darrow and Evan McMichael, received 28.2% and 3.7% of the vote, respectively.

In addition to his political career, Melerine is also an accomplished academic and professional. He earned both his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Juris Doctor (J.D.) degrees from Louisiana State University in 2010 and 2013, respectively. He has worked as an attorney with the law firm of Seabaugh & Sepulvado, LLC.

Melerine's commitment to service extends beyond his political and professional life. He has served on the boards of several organizations, including Goodwill Industries of North Louisiana, Rotary of Riverbend-Shreveport, and the Independence Bowl.

His current term in the Louisiana House of Representatives is set to end on January 10, 2028.
