Gregory A. Miller, born in 1962, is an American politician and attorney who has been serving in the Louisiana Senate from the 19th district since 2024. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Miller was born at Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma. He attended the Sacred Heart of Jesus School in Norco and the De La Salle High School, graduating in 1980. He studied political science at Louisiana State University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in 1985 and a Juris Doctor degree from the Paul M. Hebert Law Center in 1988. Miller works as an attorney.

Miller first ran as a Republican for the 56th district in the Louisiana House in 2011, winning in a runoff against Democratic candidate G. Ramachandran. He was reelected in 2015 and in 2019 without any opposition. In the House, Miller at various times chaired the House Civil Law Committee and the House and Governmental Affairs Committee.

Miller was term-limited from the House in 2023, and chose to run in the State Senate election for the 19th district, held by term-limited Democrat Gary Smith Jr. He defeated Democratic candidate Marilyn Bellock, a member of the St. Charles Parish Council, in the primary election, precluding the need for a runoff.

Miller lives in Norco, Louisiana. He is married to Amy Pfrimmer, a music professor at Tulane University. His father is Ralph R. Miller, who served in the Louisiana House for 22 years.
