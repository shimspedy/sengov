Beryl Adams Amedée is an American politician and businesswoman who is currently serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from the 51st district. She was elected in November 2015 and assumed office on January 11, 2016.

Born in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, Amedée has made significant contributions to her community both in and out of office. She is the co-owner of Forerunner Errand and Concierge, a business that provides various services to its clients. In addition to her business pursuits, Amedée is also a pastor at the Vision Christian Center in Bourg, Louisiana. Her dedication to public service extends beyond her role as a representative and pastor, as she has served as a Terrebonne Parish elections commissioner since 2001.

In her role as a state representative, Amedée has been involved in various legislative efforts. Notably, she authored legislation that would prohibit transgender athletes from competing on girls’ sports teams in schools. She also authored a proposal that would require medical providers to give patients a list of information about vaccines before administering them.

Amedée's service extends beyond her district. She was elected Vice Chair of the Republican Party of Louisiana and Vice Chair of the Legislative Women’s Caucus. She serves as a member of the Boards for the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts in Natchitoches, better known as “LSMSA,” and Stella Learning Center in Houma, a school for children with Autism and related challenges.

In her personal life, Amedée is married to John Amedée and they have three children and six grandchildren. They celebrated their 37th wedding anniversary in October. In her free time, Amedée enjoys running, gardening, fishing, and drinking chocolate milkshakes.
