Michael "Big Mike" A. Fesi, Sr. was born on May 20, 1959. He is an American politician and businessman from the state of Louisiana. As a member of the Republican party, Fesi has represented the 20th district in the Louisiana State Senate since 2020.

Before his political career, Fesi worked as an oil and gas businessman. He founded Pipeline Construction and Maintenance Inc. in 1996 and continues to serve as the company's president. In addition to this, he also owns Kid Energy USA.

In 2015, Fesi ran for State Senate against incumbent Republican Norby Chabert. Despite his efforts, he lost to Chabert in the first round of voting with 43% of the vote. However, he did not let this setback deter him. With Chabert term-limited in 2019, Fesi ran for the same seat once again. This time, he was victorious, defeating four other candidates with 54% of the vote.

In May 2021, Fesi announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19 after appearing at meetings with his colleagues. Despite this, he continues to serve his constituents with dedication and resilience.

Fesi is not just a businessman and politician. He is also a family man. He is married to Carla and they have four children together. They reside in Houma, Louisiana, U.S.

Fesi's journey is a testament to his determination and commitment to serving his community. His experiences in both the business and political world have equipped him with the knowledge and skills to effectively represent the 20th district in the Louisiana State Senate.
