Jason Wynne Hughes is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He is currently serving as a State Representative for District 100 in the Louisiana House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 13, 2020, and his current term ends on January 10, 2028.

Hughes was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S. He graduated from McDonogh #35 Senior High School and then attended Southern University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science. Hughes was a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity on campus.

Before becoming a politician himself, Hughes worked as a political strategist in Louisiana politics. He has served as the assistant legislative director to former Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, the regional manager for former US Senator Mary Landrieu, and the Director of Federal Relations for the city of New Orleans.

In 2015, Hughes was a candidate for District 100 in the Louisiana House of Representatives, but he was disqualified from the Democratic primary for failing to file a tax return in 2010. However, he ran for the same seat again in 2019 after incumbent John Bagneris decided to run for District 3 in the Louisiana State Senate. In the nonpartisan primary election, Hughes beat opponent Anthony Jackson Jr. with over 66% of the vote. The general election was canceled.

Hughes' committee assignments include Health and Welfare, Judiciary, Ways and Means, Joint Legislative Committee on Capital Outlay, and House Select Committee on Homeland Security. He is also a part of the Democratic Caucus, Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus, and Orleans Delegation.
