Early Life:
Orgeron was raised on the bayous of south Louisiana during the era of the ‘Rise of the Cajun Mariner’. He graduated from South Lafourche High School in the slump of the 1980’s oil-downturn.

He earned his bachelor's degree from Nicholls State University, and his master's degree and doctorate in physics from the University of Texas at Dallas.

Career:
After obtaining his doctorate, Orgeron went to work for M&M Mars in New Jersey forecasting crop yields for peanuts and other crops put in candy. After eight years, he returned to Louisiana, missing the bayou life in Lafourche Parish. He went to work for the family’s offshore vessel business. He is also an adjunct professor in maritime management at Nicholls State University.

In July 2020, Orgeron ran in a special election to succeed Reggie Bagala, who died in office. Orgeron won the election, and was sworn into office on July 30. His current term ends on January 10, 2028.

Personal Life:
Orgeron and his wife, Angela, live in Golden Meadow, Louisiana. They have three daughters. He is a fourth cousin of Ed Orgeron.
