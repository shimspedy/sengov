Danny McCormick is an American politician and businessman who is currently serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from the 1st district. He was elected in November 2019 and assumed office on January 13, 2020.

Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, McCormick graduated from North Caddo High School and attended McNeese State University. He is the founder of M&M Oil, demonstrating his entrepreneurial spirit.

In addition to his political career, McCormick has been involved in various organizations. He is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, the National Association for Gun Rights, and the Louisiana Shooters Association. He is also a member of Crime Stoppers of Louisiana; Delta Waterfowl; Louisiana Right to Life; and the Republican Women of Bossier, a division of the National Federation of Republican Women. McCormick founded the Caddo Parish Alliance and Caddo Lake's Last Stand.

McCormick's tenure in the Louisiana House of Representatives has not been without controversy. In September 2020, he was criticized after posting a meme on Facebook that featured an antisemitic canard conspiracy theory. McCormick also voted for and supports a draft Louisiana state bill that would make in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments and some forms of birth control a crime, and prosecute women who get abortions for murder. The draft bill has no exceptions for rape, incest, or the protection of the life of the mother.

On a personal note, McCormick and his wife, Susan, have two children. He lives in Oil City, Louisiana. He is a lifelong resident of North Caddo Parish and a small business owner. He and his wife, Susan, have been married for 38 years. They have two children and six grandchildren.
