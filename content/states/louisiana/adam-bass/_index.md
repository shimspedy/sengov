Adam Bass is an American politician who is currently serving as the Senator for Louisiana's 36th State Senate district. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Early Life and Career:
Bass was born and raised in Bossier Parish, Louisiana. He attended Airline High School and later pursued higher education at Louisiana Tech University. After completing his education, he continued to reside in Bossier and owns a local Allstate insurance agency.

Political Career:
Bass's political career began when he was selected to fill the remainder of Mike Mosura's term representing District 5 of the Bossier Parish School Board. Mosura had resigned after pleading guilty to charges of distributing anabolic steroids. There was a special election scheduled to fill the remainder of Mosura's term, which Bass won unopposed. He served as the president of the school board in 2022 and was reelected uncontested in November 2022. During his time on the board, he opposed mask mandates.

In the 2023 Louisiana State Senate election, Bass ran against incumbent Republican Robert Mills for the 36th district. He criticized Mills for being insufficiently conservative, in particular for voting for two spending bills that Bass viewed as unnecessary. Bass was endorsed by U.S. Senator John Kennedy. He won the election with 62% of the vote. Following his victory, Bass resigned from the Bossier Parish School Board in December 2023, leading to a 2024 special election for the remainder of his term.

Personal Life:
Bass lives in Bossier Parish, Louisiana. He is married to Britney and they have three children. He is a member of the Rotary Club of Bossier City. Bass identifies as a Christian and is a member of the Cypress Baptist Church.
