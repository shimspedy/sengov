Mandie Landry is an American attorney and progressive politician serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from the 91st district. She was elected in November 2019 and assumed office on January 13, 2020.

Born and raised in New Orleans, Mandie was the first in her family to graduate from college and law school. She was awarded academic scholarships to the University of Notre Dame and Georgetown Law School. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Notre Dame in 2000 and a Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center in 2005.

As an undergraduate, Landry was a legal assistant for Amnesty International. She also served as a staff assistant for Congressman Dave Obey and as a legislative correspondent for Senator Debbie Stabenow. After graduating from law school, Landry worked briefly as an attorney at Skadden. From 2006 to 2010, she was an associate at Katten Muchin Rosenman, specializing in commercial litigation and internal investigations. She was an associate at Lemle & Kelleher from 2010 to 2013 and Liskow & Lewis from 2013 to 2015. Landry founded her own law firm in 2020.

She was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in November 2019 and assumed office on January 13, 2020. On May 6, 2022, Landry, a progressive Democrat, publicly announced her run for the district 5 state senate seat, seeking to replace former Louisiana Senator Karen Carter Peterson. On November 8, 2022, Landry was defeated by Royce Duplessis, a Democrat, in the race for the Senate District 5 seat. That same month, Landry changed her voter registration to No Party Preference. Landry rejoined the Democratic Party before the legislature returned to session.

In Baton Rouge, Mandie works on legislation that is both principled and practical. As a freshman Democratic legislator, she’s become a force in Baton Rouge in every possible way: scoring money for her district and city for the S&WB and flood protection, juvenile justice, and education; fiercely defending reproductive rights; and expanding maternal health care by $20 million dollars a year.

As a lawyer, Mandie has represented an abortion clinic, a fertility clinic, and minors seeking permission from the court to have an abortion. This experience assists her in being a state legislative leader in reproductive rights. Mandie has put career as a practicing attorney to good use by becoming a skilled legislator. In Baton Rouge, Mandie works on legislation that is both principled and practical. As a member of the minority Democratic Party in a super majority Republican legislature, she’s worked across the aisle to pass sensible legislation and to educate her colleagues on progressive issues important to New Orleans. Mandie works independently of the Capitol’s army of lobbyists and special interests to do what District 91 elected her to do: stand up for those without a voice and protect our city at all costs.
