Heather Miley Cloud is an American politician, businesswoman, and educator from the state of Louisiana. A Republican, Cloud has represented the 28th district in the Louisiana State Senate since 2020.

From 2011 until 2019, Cloud served as the mayor of Turkey Creek, where she and her husband also operate a trucking business and a caf√©. In 2018, Cloud ran in a special election for Louisiana Secretary of State, but came in 8th place with 5% of the vote.

In July 2019, Cloud announced her candidacy to succeed term-limited Democratic State Senator Eric LaFleur. That October, Cloud defeated Democratic State Representatives Robert Johnson and Bernard LeBas with 63% of the vote.

Cloud won re-election to the Louisiana State Senate to represent District 28 outright in the primary on October 14, 2023, after the primary and general election were canceled.

Cloud is honored to represent Louisianians from the 28th senate district. Our district is very unique and she often refers to it as the bread basket of Louisiana. We have agriculture, industry and small businesses represented.

She continues to fight for her constituents and their families because she believes Louisiana has so much potential. She is thankful for the opportunity to serve the people of Louisiana.
