Caleb Seth Kleinpeter is an American politician serving as a member of the Louisiana State Senate for the 17th district. He assumed office on December 6, 2022.

Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and raised in Grosse Tête and Brusly, Kleinpeter graduated from Brusly High School in 2000. In 2001, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as a rifleman. Kleinpeter was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and was honorably discharged from the United States Marine Corps in 2005.

Since 2011, he has worked as a pipeline technician at Enterprise Products. Kleinpeter was elected to the Louisiana State Senate in November 2022.

Kleinpeter is a native of Grosse Tete, LA, resident of Port Allen, LA, and U.S. Marine Combat Veteran. He currently is a member of the West Baton Rouge Parish Council, representing District IV. He is a graduate of Brusly High School and holds a Bachelor of Science in Business. He is married to Kayne Daigle Kleinpeter and has three children. He is the son of Paul Kleinpeter and Kelly (Booksh) Kleinpeter of Grosse Tete, LA. He and his family regularly attend church at Holy Family Catholic Church and St. Joseph Catholic Church.

Upon graduating from Brusly High School, he began working for his family-owned business, Kelly’s Industrial Service, Inc. He joined the United States Marine Corps in July 2001 and was quickly deployed after the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center. Kleinpeter had multiple combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. During his service, he received two Combat Action Ribbons (Iraq and Afghanistan), Navy and Marine Corp Achievement Medal, Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, two Sea Service Deployment Ribbons, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (Iraq), National Defense Service Medal, Presidential Unit Citation-Navy, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal. He was honorably discharged in 2005 at the rank of Sergeant.

Kleinpeter has been employed with Enterprise Products for the past 11 years, currently working as a Pipeline Technician, and also serves as chairman of the Regional Safety Committee. Caleb’s first run for political office occurred in 2019, when he was elected as West Baton Rouge Parish Councilman in District IV. While in office, his efforts have been focused on improving West Baton Rouge through fiscal responsibility. He believes smart growth as it relates to infrastructure is vital. Time and time again, he has demonstrated his commitment to serve as an advocate for taxpayers. Caleb has earned a reputation of meticulously reviewing budgets and projects of all sizes, to be certain all project deliverables are met. If elected, Kleinpeter pledges to work with all elected officials throughout District 17. He takes great pride in being a public servant and is committed to being a voice for all of the parishes in an effort to improve our communities. He believes starting and completing the 415 connector will be an important step, as is continuing to fight for additional funding for a new bridge over the Mississippi River. Kleinpeter also believes these are only the beginning steps toward building sufficient infrastructure, and this effort must continue for our region to thrive.
