Rodney Wayne Schamerhorn, born on January 11, 1955, is an American politician and businessman who is currently serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from the 24th district.

Early Life and Education:
Schamerhorn was born in Jasper, Texas, and raised in Florien, Louisiana. He completed his high school education at Hicks High School in Vernon Parish, Louisiana. He further pursued his studies at Louisiana College and Northwestern State University, but did not earn a degree.

Career:
In 1984, Schamerhorn founded a company named Schamerhorn, Inc., which offers services in trucking, demolition, and waste management. His political career began when he contested the 2015 jungle primary for the Louisiana House of Representatives but did not unseat the incumbent of district 24, Frank A. Howard.

In September 2019, Schamerhorn announced that he would contest Howard's seat for a second time, as Howard was subject to term limits. In the 2019 jungle primary, Schamerhorn faced fellow Republican Gregory Lord and political independent Willie Banks. By winning a simple majority of the vote, Schamerhorn was elected as Howard's successor. He was sworn into office on January 13, 2020.

Schamerhorn is a member of the House Rural Caucus and Republican Delegation. He won re-election to the Louisiana House of Representatives to represent District 24 outright in the primary on October 14, 2023, after the general election was canceled.

Personal Life:
Schamerhorn and his wife, Tammy, have two children.
