Mike Johnson, born on January 30, 1972, in Shreveport, Louisiana, is an American lawyer and Republican politician. He represents the 4th district of Louisiana, which encompasses the state's northwestern and western regions. Johnson is known for his ardent social conservatism.

Johnson's early life was marked by a profound event. His father, who was a firefighter, was severely burned and disabled while on duty. This incident had a deep impact on Johnson, leading him to become a person of deep faith. He grew up in a rural area outside Shreveport, Louisiana, and graduated from Captain Shreve High School in Shreveport. He then went on to receive a B.S. in business administration from Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge.

Before entering politics, Johnson worked as an attorney in private practice and for Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). At ADF, he advocated for sodomy laws and criminalizing homosexuality, writing an amicus brief that opposed the eventual U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas (2003). A young-earth creationist, Johnson sat on the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention between 2004 and 2012.

Johnson's political career began when he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 2015; he served in that body until 2017. He was first elected to represent Louisiana's 4th congressional district in 2016. He has been identified as a member of the Christian right. During his time in Congress, he contested the results of the 2020 presidential election on the House floor and in court. He supported bills that would institute a nationwide ban on abortion. Johnson was chair of the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus of conservatives in Congress, from 2019 to 2021. He was vice chair of the House Republican Conference from 2021 to 2023.

On October 25, 2023, following the ousting of Kevin McCarthy from the speakership, Johnson was elected as the 56th speaker of the House. This marked a significant milestone in his political career, making him one of the least experienced speakers in modern U.S. political history.
