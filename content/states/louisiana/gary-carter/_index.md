Gary Michael Carter Jr., born in November 1974, is an American attorney and politician. He is currently serving as the Democratic member of the Louisiana Senate for the 7th district. Before this, he served in the Louisiana House of Representatives representing the 102nd district, which encompasses the Algiers neighborhood.

Carter was born and raised in New Orleans. He completed his high school education at Archbishop Shaw High School. He then went on to earn his Bachelor's degree from Xavier University. Following this, he pursued law and earned his J.D. degree from Tulane University Law School, all in New Orleans.

Professionally, Carter is a partner at the firm, Kelly Hart & Pitre. He began his political career on January 11, 2016, when he succeeded fellow Democrat Jeff Arnold in the Louisiana House of Representatives. Arnold was ineligible to seek a fourth four-year term in the legislative primary held on October 24, 2015. In the primary, Carter polled 57 percent of the ballots cast against five fellow Democrats.

Carter has always emphasized an economic plan to establish more jobs and invest in education to "break the long-term cycle of crime in our city." In June 2021, Carter was elected to the Louisiana Senate in a special election to succeed his uncle Troy Carter, who had been elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2023, Gary Carter Jr. was re-elected to his position as a member of the Louisiana State Senate, representing District 7. He ran unopposed, securing another term in office.

In his personal life, Carter is a Roman Catholic. His uncle is Troy Carter. He resides in Algiers, New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.
