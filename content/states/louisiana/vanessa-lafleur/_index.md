Vanessa Caston LaFleur is an American attorney and politician serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from the 101st district. She assumed office on April 11, 2022.

Born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, LaFleur graduated from Baton Rouge Magnet High School in 1986. She then pursued higher education at Southern University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1990 and a Juris Doctor from the Southern University Law Center in 1993.

In her professional career, LaFleur has held several significant positions.

LaFleur was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in a 2022 special election, succeeding Edward James. She won re-election to represent District 101 outright in the primary on October 14, 2023, after the primary and general election were canceled.

As a representative, LaFleur has been assigned to several committees, including the Administration of Criminal Justice Committee, Commerce Committee, and House Retirement Committee.

LaFleur's dedication to public service and her extensive experience in law and government administration make her a valuable member of the Louisiana House of Representatives.
