Monica Carol Church is an American politician who serves in the Idaho House of Representatives from seat A of the 19th district as a member of the Democratic Party. Born and raised in Boise, Idaho, Monica is the granddaughter of notable political figures Cecil Andrus and Frank Church. Her grandmother, Bethine Church, also played a significant role in her upbringing, instilling in her a deep sense of public service and community involvement.

Monica graduated from Timberline High School in 2000 and went on to pursue higher education at Whitman College, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. She furthered her education at Boise State University, obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in social studies secondary education, a Bachelor of Arts in history, and a Master of Education in education leadership and administration.

Before entering politics, Monica had a distinguished career in education. She was recognized for her contributions to the field with awards such as the U.S. Presidential Scholars Programâ€™s Distinguished Teachers award in 2019 and 2023, and the Morehead-Cain Impact Educator award in 2023. Monica also served as a City of Boise ethics commissioner and was a member of Idaho's delegation to the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition.

In 2024, Monica decided to run for the Idaho House of Representatives after Lauren Necochea declined to seek reelection to focus on her role as chair of the Idaho Democratic Party. Monica won the Democratic nomination without opposition and went on to defeat Republican nominee Jim Feederle in the general election. During her tenure in the state house, she has served on the Education, Local Government, and Resources and Conservation committees.

Monica is married to Chad, and they have one child together. She continues to be an active member of her community, serving on multiple boards with a focus on public lands and conservation. Her dedication to public service and education has made her a respected figure in Idaho politics.
