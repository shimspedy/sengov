Jim Guthrie, born on July 13, 1955, in Pocatello, Idaho, is an American politician and a Republican member of the Idaho Senate. He has been serving District 28 since 2012. Prior to this, he served in the Idaho House of Representatives from 2010 to 2012 for District 29 Seat B.

Guthrie graduated from Marsh Valley High School. His professional experience includes owning a ranch. He was a Bannock County Commissioner from 2001 until 2007. In 2016, an extramarital affair between Guthrie and Idaho Representative Christy Perry was brought to light by a political activist after an interview with Guthrie's former wife.

In terms of elections, Guthrie has had a notable journey. In the 2018 elections, Guthrie defeated Alan B. Curtis with 63.3% of the vote to win the Republican primary. In the general election, he defeated Democrat Mike Saville with 61.9% of the vote. In 2016, Guthrie was unopposed in the Republican primary and defeated Mike Saville in the general election with 61.6% of the vote. In 2014, Guthrie was unopposed in the Republican primary and general election. In 2012, redistricted to District 28, Guthrie chose to run for its open senate seat. He won the Republican primary with 65.3% of the vote against W. Rusty Barlow. Guthrie defeated Democratic nominee Dave Finkelnburg in the general election with 66.1% of the vote to succeed Republican Senator Steve Bair, who was redistricted to District 31.

In 2006, when Democratic Senator Bert Marley left the District 29 seat open for a run as Superintendent of Public Instruction, Guthrie ran unopposed in the Republican primary. However, Guthrie lost the general election by 370 votes to Democrat Diane Bilyeu. In 2010, with Democratic Representative James D. Ruchti vacating the District 29 B seat, Guthrie ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Guthrie won the general election with 59.8% of the vote against Greg Anderson.
