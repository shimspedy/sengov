Steve Miller, a member of the Republican Party, is currently serving in the Idaho House of Representatives, representing District 24B. He assumed office on December 1, 2022, and his current term ends on December 1, 2024.

Miller was born in Wendell, Idaho. After graduating from Camas County High School, he earned a B.S. in agricultural engineering from the University of Idaho. His career experience includes working as a farmer and rancher. He has also served as the president of the Idaho Association of Conservation Districts and as the secretary/treasurer of the National Association of Conservation Districts.

In the 2023-2024 legislative session, Miller was assigned to the following committees: Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee (Co-Chair), Transportation and Defense Committee, and Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee.

Miller ran for election to the Idaho House of Representatives to represent District 24B and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. Prior to his current tenure, he represented District 26A in the Idaho House of Representatives.

In addition to his political career, Miller is a rancher and farmer by profession. His commitment to public service and his extensive experience in agriculture have been instrumental in his legislative work, particularly in areas related to agricultural affairs and resource conservation.
