Clint Hostetler is a dedicated member of the Idaho House of Representatives, representing District 24A. Born in Fairfield, California, Clint's journey to public service is marked by a strong work ethic and a commitment to conservative values. He graduated from Dixon High School and went on to earn a bachelor's degree from California State University, Sacramento in 2007. 

Clint's career began at a young age when he started working at the age of 14, cleaning bathrooms in a truck stop gas station in Mancos, Colorado. His work ethic continued to develop as he moved back to California at the age of 15 and began working in the restaurant industry, where he stayed for almost 20 years. During this time, he learned to work with and serve people from various socio-economic backgrounds while working his way through college.

In 2009, Clint founded his own graphic and web design company, which he continues to operate. His professional experience as a small business owner has given him valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by entrepreneurs and working families.

Clint's conservative worldview was shaped by his father, who instilled in him the values of hard work and common sense. He learned to use objective reasoning and logic to recognize and refute emotionally deceptive narratives, a skill that continues to influence his political ideologies. Clint is a firm believer in the principles of faith, family, and liberty, which he considers the foundation of the United States' Constitutional Republic.

In 2011, Clint gave his life to Jesus, a decision that has profoundly impacted his personal and professional life. He is a Christian first, a family man second, and an American third. His faith and commitment to his family are central to his worldview and political philosophy.

Clint and his family moved to Idaho in June 2021, seeking a new beginning and a community that shared their values. They were drawn to Idaho's liberty and traditional American values, which they found to be a welcome change from their previous experiences in California. However, Clint soon realized that the same challenges that eroded the Golden State were beginning to take root in Idaho. This realization motivated him to run for office and work to preserve the values that make Idaho a great place to live.

As a member of the Idaho House of Representatives, Clint is committed to serving his constituents and protecting the principles of faith, family, and liberty. He is dedicated to ensuring that Idaho remains a beacon of freedom and opportunity for future generations. Clint's journey from a small-town upbringing to a state legislator is a testament to his resilience, dedication, and unwavering commitment to his values.
