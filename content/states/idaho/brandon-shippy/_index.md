Senator Brandon Shippy is a dedicated public servant representing District 9 in the Idaho State Senate. Appointed on July 18, 2024, to fill a Senate vacancy, Brandon is a native Idahoan with deep roots in the Western Treasure Valley. His great-grandfather settled in Weiser after World War II, and his grandfather raised his family in New Plymouth. Continuing this legacy, Brandon's father also lived in Fruitland and New Plymouth, where Brandon developed a profound love for his state and country.

Brandon and his wife, Rakel, chose to stay in Payette County to raise their three children, embracing the community that has been an integral part of their family's history. Brandon's upbringing instilled in him a strong work ethic and an entrepreneurial spirit, leading him to establish his own small business, Shippy Sprinkler LLC, in New Plymouth.

Brandon's conservative values are deeply rooted and well-expressed through his various roles in the community. He serves as a precinct committeeman for the Idaho Republican Party, representing his neighbors and advocating for their interests. His dedication to public service extends to his volunteer work as a deacon in his church and his involvement with Narrow Path Prison Ministries, where he shares the gospel with inmates. Additionally, Brandon and Rakel have opened their home as foster care providers, demonstrating their commitment to helping those in need.

In the Idaho State Senate, Brandon serves on several important committees, including Judiciary & Rules, Health & Welfare, and State Affairs. His leadership and dedication to his constituents have earned him respect and recognition within the state legislature. Brandon's family is truly interwoven into the fabric of the community, past, present, and future, and his commitment to public service reflects his deep love for Idaho and its people.
