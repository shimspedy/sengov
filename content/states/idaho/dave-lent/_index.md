Dave Lent is an American politician who has made significant contributions to the state of Idaho. He was born in Idaho Falls and raised in Shelley. His occupation has primarily been in the nuclear industry, specifically in health physics and managing nuclear facility training programs. He has lived and worked in 7 states and is currently finishing up his second term in the Idaho Senate.

Lent is a graduate of Eastern Idaho Technical College and Idaho State University. He has worked with the Idaho National Laboratory since the 1980s, winning several awards for regulatory reform and cost-cutting. He has also served on advisory boards for the College of Eastern Idaho and Idaho State University.

In addition to his work in the nuclear industry, Lent served on the Idaho Falls School District 91 Board of Trustees from 2006 to 2018, resigning to take his seat in the Idaho Senate. He played a key role in replacing four elementary schools and transitioning a junior high into a successful project-based high school.

Lent ran for the Idaho Senate in 2018, defeating incumbent District 33 senator Tony Potts in the Republican primary. He was elected with 60% of the vote over Democrat Jerry Sehlke in the general election. In the Idaho Senate, Lent serves on the Agricultural Affairs and Education committees. He was appointed by Governor Brad Little to serve on the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education.

Lent has been married for 43 years to his wife Terri, who has taught performing arts to children in their area for 30 years. Together they have five children and 13 grandchildren. They enjoy hosting family and friends at their Spencer cabin and boating on area waters.
