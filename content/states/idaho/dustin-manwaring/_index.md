Dustin Whitney Manwaring is an American attorney and politician serving as a Republican member of the Idaho House of Representatives, representing District 29A. He was born in Pocatello, Idaho, U.S. and was raised in Blackfoot, Idaho. He graduated from Blackfoot High School and went on to earn a Bachelor of Science from the University of Utah and a Juris Doctor from Drake University School of Law.

Manwaring practices law in Pocatello, Idaho, assisting clients with business and intellectual property issues in both California and Idaho. Previously, he worked for SkyWest Airlines, Mitt Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, the Iowa Republican Party, and as a law clerk for the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa. Manwaring has argued cases before the Idaho Supreme Court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Ninth Circuit.

After Idaho Representative Mark Nye announced his candidacy for the Idaho Senate, Manwaring subsequently announced his candidacy for the Idaho House of Representatives seat held by Nye. He was unopposed in the 2016 Republican primary and defeated Pocatello attorney David Maguire in the 2016 general election. Manwaring was the only Republican serving in Legislative District 29 from 2016 to 2018 and again from 2020 to 2022, when Manwaring won re-election for the 29th district against Chris Abernathy.

In 2017, Manwaring was nominated by the speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives to participate in NCSL's Emerging Leaders Symposium hosted at the PayPal headquarters in San Jose, California. On January 6, 2018, Manwaring was recognized by the Idaho Young Republicans as the 2017 Elected Official of the Year. In April 2018, Manwaring was selected to attend the State Legislative Leaders Foundation Emerging Leaders Program for up to 50 of the best and brightest state legislators from across the nation held at the University of Virginia, in partnership with the Darden School of Business.

In August 2018, Manwaring participated in a political exchange program to New Zealand organized by the American Council of Young Political Leaders (ACYPL). In June 2021, Manwaring was appointed to serve on the Workforce Development Committee of the Council of State Governments West (CSG West). On July 30, 2021, Manwaring was appointed by Governor Brad Little to serve on the State of Idaho's inaugural Cybersecurity Task Force. In December 2022, Manwaring was elected Majority Caucus Chair in the Idaho House of Representatives. In January 2023, Manwaring was appointed to the Idaho State Capitol Commission.
