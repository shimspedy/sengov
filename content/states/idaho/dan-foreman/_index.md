Daniel D. Foreman, born in 1953 in Lake Forest, Illinois, is an American politician who served as a member of the Idaho Senate from 2016 to 2018. He represented the 5th district, which covers parts of Benewah and Latah counties.

Foreman was born in Lake Forest, Illinois. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business management and administration from Bradley University in 1975. He served in the United States Air Force for 30 years and retired as a colonel. He later worked as a police officer with the Moscow Police Department.

Foreman was elected to the Idaho Senate in 2016, narrowly defeating incumbent Democratic Senator Dan Schmidt. During his first weeks in office, Foreman introduced several bills to the legislature, including one that would classify abortion as first-degree murder — for the mother, as well as the doctor who performs the operation — except in cases where the mother’s life is endangered. He also introduced a bill that would reduce Idaho's sales tax from 6% to 5%, as well as two other tax bills.

Foreman denies climate change, referring to it as a "scam". He does not support the separation of church and state. He has been a vocal critic of his own district, calling the area a "cesspool of liberalism".

Foreman was defeated in the November 2018 elections, losing to Democrat David Nelson. After his tenure in the Senate, he assumed office again on December 1, 2022, representing the 6th district.

Foreman and his wife, Maria, have 7 children and 20 grandchildren. He refers to himself as "a Christian, conservative Republican."
