Born and raised in Syracuse, Utah, Mitchell is a graduate of Clearfield High School. He furthered his education at Weber State University and Brigham Young Universityâ€“Idaho, where he earned a bachelor's degree in business administration in 2019.

Mitchell is not just a politician but also a successful entrepreneur. He has been a small business co-owner with his wife since January 2013. His career experience includes co-owning a Jiffy Lube franchise and working as a scuba instructor and a district manager with Heartland Automotive Services.

Beyond his professional life, Mitchell has a rich history of community service. He served as a leader in the Boy Scouts of America from 2006 to 2018. He and his wife have been certified therapeutic foster parents and served in that capacity for 12 years.

Mitchell is a lifetime benefactor member of the NRA and holds a 2nd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. He has served in various ecclesiastical leadership roles, demonstrating his commitment to his faith and community.

On a personal note, Mitchell has been married to his wife, Marcie, for 32 years. They have one son and two daughters, one of whom is adopted and still lives at home, and one foster child. They are also proud grandparents to five grandchildren.

In his legislative role, Mitchell has been assigned to several committees, including Business, Health & Welfare, Transportation & Defense, House Education Committee, Judiciary, Rules, and Administration Committee, and Local Government Committee, where he served as Chair in 2023-2024.

Mitchell's dedication to his family, community, and public service is evident in his varied roles and responsibilities. His journey from a small farm in Syracuse, Utah, to the Idaho House of Representatives is a testament to his hard work, integrity, and love for others.
