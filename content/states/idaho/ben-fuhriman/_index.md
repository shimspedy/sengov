Ben Fuhriman, a dedicated public servant and financial planner, represents District 30B in the Idaho House of Representatives. Born and raised in Ammon, Idaho, Ben grew up in a traditional family home where he learned the values of hard work and perseverance from an early age. His father, Steve Fuhriman, who served as the Mayor of Ammon, instilled in him a strong sense of community and responsibility.

Ben's early years were marked by his involvement in the Boy Scouts of America, where he earned his Eagle Scout rank and multiple merit badges. His first year at scout camp saw him earn an impressive 13 merit badges, showcasing his task-driven nature and goal-oriented mindset. These experiences laid the foundation for his future leadership roles and problem-solving abilities.

Throughout high school, Ben worked various jobs to support himself and fund his activities. He mowed lawns, cleaned buildings, and made videos for events, demonstrating his entrepreneurial spirit and determination. Graduating as valedictorian from Hillcrest High School, he delivered a commencement address that emphasized his life motto: "Do it, Do it right, Do it right now."

After high school, Ben served a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This experience further shaped his character and commitment to service. Upon returning, he pursued higher education at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where he studied Business and Information Systems. It was during this time that he met his wife, Holli, while volunteering for the Republican Party's "Get Out the Vote" campaign in Tennessee. Their whirlwind romance led to marriage just five months later, and they have since built a life together with their four children in the Shelley School District.

Ben continued his education by earning a master's degree in family financial planning from Montana State University. As a Certified Financial Plannerâ„¢ and accredited financial counselor, he works with clients from all walks of life, helping them navigate complex financial and behavioral finance issues. His expertise spans investing, insurance, retirement, estate, tax, and college planning.

In addition to his professional career, Ben is actively involved in his community. He serves on the board of directors for the Grand Teton Council Boy Scouts of America and the Development Workshop in Idaho Falls. His passion for technology, travel, and college football adds to his well-rounded personality.

Ben's journey to the Idaho House of Representatives began with his election in November 2024. He assumed office on December 1, 2024, and has since been committed to representing the interests of his constituents. His dedication to public service, combined with his financial expertise and community involvement, make him a valuable asset to the Idaho legislature. Ben continues to work tirelessly to address the needs of his district and contribute to the betterment of Idaho.
