Carrie Semmelroth is an American politician and academic who is currently serving as a member of the Idaho Senate from the 17th district. She assumed office on November 24, 2021, succeeding Alison Rabe.

Semmelroth's journey in education began at Boise State University where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology. She continued her studies at the same institution, earning a Master of Science in special education, and a Doctor of Education in curriculum and instruction. Her commitment to education extends beyond her own studies, as she also holds an Exceptional Child Generalist Idaho teaching certification (K-12).

Before her political career, Semmelroth was a candidate for the Idaho House of Representatives in 2014. Despite losing in the Democratic primary to incumbent John Gannon, she remained undeterred in her political pursuits. In addition to her political career, she works at the Boise State University College of Education, further cementing her dedication to the field of education.

In 2021, Semmelroth was appointed by Governor Brad Little to fill the Senate vacancy in District 17, previously held by Alison Rabe. She ran for re-election to the Idaho State Senate to represent District 17 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Semmelroth's tenure as a senator has been marked by her dedication to her constituents and her commitment to improving the state's education system. Her current term ends on December 1, 2024.
