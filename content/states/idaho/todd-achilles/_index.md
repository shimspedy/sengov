He assumed office on February 17, 2024, and his current term ends on December 1, 2024. He was appointed to the Idaho House of Representatives to replace former Rep. Colin Nash (D).

He holds graduate degrees in business, international studies, and public policy. After his military service, Todd spent over 20 years in the technology sector. He now teaches public policy with a focus on broadband access, antimonopoly, competition, renewable energy, and tech policy.
