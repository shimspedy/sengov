Carl J. Bjerke is a Republican senator representing District 5 in the Idaho State Legislature. He was born in 1962 in Long Beach, California, and now resides in Coeur d’ Alene, Idaho.

Before his political career, Bjerke had a diverse professional background. He worked as a respiratory therapist and even served as an apprentice mortician. His career took a significant turn when he joined the Santa Monica Fire Department in 1987. Over a span of 32 years, he rose through the ranks and retired as the department's deputy chief of operations. During his tenure, he managed all fire department operational divisions, including the department’s EMS system.

Bjerke's educational qualifications include an Associate degree in respiratory therapy and a Bachelor's degree in organizational leadership. He is also a graduate of the Paramedic Training Institute.

In addition to his professional and educational accomplishments, Bjerke served seven years on the management team for the LA Marathon and was a former trustee for the SMFD Health Benefits Trust.

Bjerke and his wife, Lesli, have been married for over 32 years and have two grown children, a son and a daughter.

In the political arena, Bjerke assumed office on December 1, 2022. His current term ends on December 1, 2024. He serves on the Finance Committee as Vice Chair and is also a member of the Health & Welfare Committee.

Bjerke's journey from a respiratory therapist to a deputy fire chief, and now a state senator, is a testament to his dedication and commitment to serving the community.
