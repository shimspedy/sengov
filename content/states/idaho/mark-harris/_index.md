Mark Harris is an American politician serving as a member of the Idaho Senate from the 35th district. He assumed office on December 1, 2022. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Harris was born and raised in Soda Springs, Idaho. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Utah State University. After completing his education, Harris returned to his hometown and began his career as a rancher.

In the summer of 2015, when Senator John Tippets resigned his seat for an appointment as director of the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, the Legislative District 32 Republican Central Committee met to fill the vacancy in the Senate seat. They sent three names in order of preference to Governor Butch Otter: Harris, Larry Oja of Malad City, and R. Scott Workman of Preston. Governor Otter appointed Harris to serve the remainder of Tippet's term.

Since then, Harris has run and won several elections. He has served on the boards of Bear Lake Memorial Hospital, the Idaho Farm Bureau, and the Idaho Cattle Association.

In terms of committee assignments, Harris has been a part of several committees including the Health and Welfare Committee, Transportation Committee, and the Agriculture Affairs Committee. He has also served as the Co-chair of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee.

In 2022, Harris ran for re-election to the Idaho State Senate to represent District 35. He won in the general election on November 8, 2022. His current term ends on December 1, 2024.
