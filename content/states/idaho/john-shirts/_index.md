John Shirts is a dedicated public servant and a proud representative of Idaho's District 9A in the Idaho House of Representatives. Born and raised in Nampa, Idaho, John has deep roots in the community and a strong commitment to serving his constituents.

John's journey to public office began with his education. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Idaho in 2009, where he developed a passion for public service and leadership. After completing his undergraduate studies, John joined the U.S. Air Force Reserve in 2014, where he served with distinction as a JAG officer. His military service took him to various locations, including Korea, where he served as an adviser to the 51st Fighter Wing on Osan Air Base. He was also appointed to the Air Force's Special Victims Unit (SVU) and served as a Senior Trial Counsel (STC).

In addition to his military service, John pursued further education, earning a law degree from the University of Colorado Law School and a master's degree from Harvard Extension School. His legal expertise and dedication to justice led him to clerk for the Honorable Jonathan P. Brody, an Idaho District Court judge, and later serve as an Assistant United States Attorney under President Trump's administration.

John's commitment to public service extends beyond his military and legal careers. He ran for election to the Idaho House of Representatives in 2024 and won the general election on November 5, 2024. He assumed office on December 1, 2024, and has been serving his constituents with dedication and integrity ever since. As a member of the Idaho House of Representatives, John serves on several important committees, including Agricultural Affairs, Judiciary, Rules & Administration, and Revenue & Taxation.

John is a fifth-generation Idahoan and was raised on his family's working ranch in Washington County. He attended Weiser High School and continues to reside on the family ranch with his spouse, Mercedes, who is a high school teacher. John's deep connection to his community and his commitment to public service make him a respected and effective representative for the people of District 9A.
