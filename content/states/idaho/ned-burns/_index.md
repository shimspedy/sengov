Ned Burns Woude is a distinguished member of the Idaho House of Representatives, representing District 26A. He is a member of the Democratic Party and has been serving in this position since January 10, 2022. His current term is set to end on December 1, 2024.

Born and raised in Twin Falls, Ned is a proud graduate of Twin Falls High School, Class of '95. After high school, he attended the University of Montana where he studied business administration and accounting.

Before embarking on his political career, Ned began his professional journey in the restaurant industry. He later transitioned into real estate, becoming a realtor in the Wood River Valley region. He has worked for Coldwell Banker and has been serving on the Sun Valley Board of Realtors Board of Directors since 2017. He was elected as the board president in 2019.

In addition to his real estate career, Ned has been actively involved in local governance. He was elected as the mayor of Bellevue in 2018 and was reelected in 2020. During his tenure, he also served on the Bellevue City Council, the Bellevue Urban Renewal Agency, and the Sun Valley Economic Development Board.

Ned's appointment to the Idaho House of Representatives came in December 2021 by Governor Brad Little, succeeding Marianna Davis. As a legislator, Ned has been assigned to several committees including the Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee, Resources and Conservation Committee, Revenue and Taxation Committee, Transportation and Defense Committee, Ways and Means Committee, Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee, and the Joint Millennium Fund Committee.

Outside of his professional and political life, Ned is an avid skier, hunter, fisher, and recreational league hockey player. He currently resides in Bellevue with his spouse, Sara, and their silly Pug named Jimmy.
