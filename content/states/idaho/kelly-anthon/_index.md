Kelly Arthur Anthon, born on August 4, 1974, is a Republican Idaho State Senator since 2015 representing District 27. He is a 7th generation Idahoan raised in Declo, Idaho, where his family has operated a farming operation for over 100 years.

Anthon was born in Burley, Idaho. He was raised on a family farm near Declo, Idaho, attending public schools in Declo and graduating from Declo High School in 1992. He served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Japan, and later graduated from Brigham Young University with a Bachelor of Arts in anthropology in 1998 and from the University of Idaho College of Law in 2002 where he was also named the Bistline Scholar and student body president. In 2017, Anthon completed training as a professional civil mediator at Pepperdine University.

Upon passing the Idaho bar exam, he worked as an attorney in private practice in Idaho's Mini-Cassia Area. In 2003 he was appointed city attorney for Rupert, Minidoka, and Acequia cities. He also served as the City Attorney and Prosecutor for the City of Burley. At the time of his first appointment, he was the youngest city attorney in Idaho. In 2012, Anthon was hired as Rupert City Administrator. Anthon also serves on the corporate board of directors of the Mart Group—a potato processing and marketing company. In 2020, Anthon began teaching part time at the University of Idaho College of Law.

After his first year in the Idaho Senate, Anthon was recognized as one of the 'Emerging Leaders' in the nation's state legislatures by The State Legislative Leaders Foundation. Idaho Senate Republicans elected Anthon in 2017 as the Majority Caucus Chairman—one of four Republican leadership positions in the Idaho State Senate. In 2020, Anthon was elected as the Idaho Senate Majority Leader. He was re-elected Majority Leader in 2022.

Anthon's professional experience includes practicing law at Robinson, Anthon & Tribe; serving as city attorney for the cities of Burley, Rupert, Acequia, and Minidoka; and working as city administrator for the city of Rupert. He has served as president of the Minidoka Healthcare Foundation, executive member of the Idaho Municipal Attorney Association, and on the board of the Region IV Development Corporation, among other community leadership positions.

Anthon is married to Joelle (Rogers) and they have five children.
