Christy Zito is an American politician who has made significant contributions to the state of Idaho. Born and raised in Utah, she pursued her education in farm and ranch management at Bridgerland Technical College, where she earned an Associate of Science degree. Her early life was deeply rooted in agriculture, which later influenced her political career.

Zito's political journey began in 2016 when she was elected to the Idaho House of Representatives, representing the 23rd district. During her tenure in the House, she was known for her strong advocacy for gun rights and the Second Amendment. One of her notable achievements was sponsoring House Bill 206 in 2019, which allowed Idaho residents aged 18-20 to carry concealed weapons without a permit. The bill received overwhelming support and was signed into law by Governor Brad Little.

In 2020, Zito decided to run for the Idaho State Senate, succeeding Bert Brackett in the 23rd district. She continued her advocacy for gun rights and other conservative values during her time in the Senate. However, due to redistricting, she served only one term in the Senate before deciding not to run for re-election in 2022.

After her time in the Senate, Zito focused on her role with the Idaho Second Amendment Alliance, an organization dedicated to protecting and promoting gun rights in the state. She also remained active in her community, participating in various local organizations and events.

In 2024, Zito made a successful return to the Idaho State Senate, this time representing the 8th district. Her experience and dedication to her constituents have made her a respected figure in Idaho politics. Throughout her career, she has been a strong advocate for conservative values, agriculture, and the rights of Idaho residents.

Zito's personal life is equally impressive. She is a proud mother of five children and has numerous grandchildren. Her family and agricultural background have always been central to her identity and have greatly influenced her political views and actions. She continues to reside in Hammett, Idaho, where she remains an active member of her community.
