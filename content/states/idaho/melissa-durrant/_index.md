Melissa Durrant Woude is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 23A in the Idaho House of Representatives. She assumed office on December 1, 2022, and her current term ends on December 1, 2024.

Melissa was born in Roosevelt, Utah, and now resides in Kuna, Idaho. She graduated from Union High School and went on to earn bachelor's degrees in health science from Boise State University and communicative disorders and deaf education from Utah State University.

Before entering politics, Melissa was a business owner. She grew up in a small farming town in Utah where her father served as a deputy for the county sheriffâ€™s office and an EMS first responder. After moving to Idaho in 2006 when she married her husband, they started a family and now have four children.

In addition to her husband working on his family farm, they farm around 300 acres themselves in the Kuna area. Melissa believes that raising her children to have the work ethic and values of the agricultural community has been one of the best decisions she has ever made.

Melissa has served in Young Farmer and Rancher leadership positions on committees on the local level, state level, and a 2-year term on the national committee. She has also been involved in different committees within her local school district and has coached soccer for 5 years with Kuna PAL.

Melissa ran for election to the Idaho House of Representatives to represent District 23A and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. During her tenure, she has been assigned to various committees including the Business Committee, Resources and Conservation Committee, Revenue and Taxation Committee, House State Affairs Committee, and the Transportation and Defense Committee, where she serves as Chair.

Education is a significant issue for Melissa as she has three children currently in public schools and one who will be in a few years. She believes that all children should receive a quality education as it forms the foundation for them to build on for the rest of their lives. She is also passionate about preserving the agricultural industry in Idaho.
