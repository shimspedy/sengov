Jim Woodward is an American politician who has served as a Republican member of the Idaho State Senate, representing District 1. Born and raised in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, Woodward has deep roots in his community. He graduated from Bonners Ferry High School and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Idaho.

Woodward's career began in the United States Navy, where he served as a submarine officer for 21 years, both on active duty and in the reserves. His military service instilled in him a strong sense of duty and leadership, which he carried into his civilian career. After leaving the Navy, Woodward entered the construction industry, eventually becoming the owner of Apex Construction Services, a heavy construction and excavating company.

In addition to his professional endeavors, Woodward has been actively involved in his community. He has served on the boards of the Northern Lights Electric Cooperative and the Idaho Consumer Owned Utilities Association. His commitment to public service and community involvement led him to run for the Idaho State Senate.

Woodward was first elected to the Idaho State Senate in 2018, succeeding Shawn Keough, who endorsed him as her successor. During his tenure, he served on several important committees, including the Education and Finance committees. His work in the Senate focused on issues such as education, infrastructure, and fiscal responsibility.

In 2022, Woodward faced a challenging primary election and lost to Scott Herndon. However, he remained committed to his political career and, in 2024, he successfully defeated Herndon in a primary rematch, reclaiming his seat in the Idaho State Senate. Woodward's dedication to his constituents and his ability to navigate the complexities of state politics have earned him respect and recognition within his party and beyond.

Woodward is married to his wife, Brenda, and they have two children. The family resides in Sagle, Idaho, where they are actively involved in their local community. Woodward's background in engineering, military service, and business ownership provides him with a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing Idaho. His commitment to public service and his dedication to his constituents continue to drive his work in the Idaho State Senate.
