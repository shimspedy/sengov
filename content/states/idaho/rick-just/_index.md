Rick Just is an American politician and author who is currently serving as a member of the Idaho Senate for the 15th district. He was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on December 1, 2022.

Born as James Just in Blackfoot, Idaho, Rick graduated from Firth High School. He furthered his education at Boise State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and a Master of Public Administration.

In addition to his political and public service career, Rick is also an accomplished author. He has written two adult novels, four young adult (YA) novels, and several books on Idaho history. His love for Idaho's history is evident in his daily Idaho history blog on his site and on Facebook called 'Speaking of Idaho'. He also writes a weekly history column for Boise Weekly and occasionally a history column for the Idaho Press.

Rick's commitment to public service extends beyond his professional roles. He has been affiliated with various organizations including Friends of Idaho State Parks, where he served as president, Boise District Bureau of Land Management Resource Advisory Council, where he was a member, and the Idaho Writers Guild, where he was a former board member. He was also a past board member of the Learning Lab of Boise and the Anser Charter School board, and a former president of the Society of Outdoor Recreation Professionals and the National Association of Recreation Resource Planners.

Rick's tenure in the Idaho State Senate began in 2022 and his current term ends in 2024. During his time in office, he has sponsored numerous bills, demonstrating his commitment to serving the people of Idaho.
