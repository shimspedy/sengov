James Petzke is a representative for District 21 (Meridian) in the Idaho House of Representatives. He is a member of the Republican Party and began his first term in December of 2022.

Born and raised in Hailey, Idaho, James has lived in the state since he was 2 years old. He is a graduate of both Boise State University, where he earned his A.A. and B.A., and Harvard University Extension School, where he completed his M.A. in finance.

Before his political career, James spent ten years as an entrepreneur and small business owner. He got his start in freelance web design and quickly moved into eCommerce sales. He is the co-founder of Upland Optics, a sporting optics company for hunters.

In the Idaho House of Representatives, James sits on the Appropriations, Business, and Transportation committees. He co-wrote Bill 92 alongside Debbie Critchfield, the superintendent of public instruction, which mandates financial literacy classes in Idaho high schools.

James is a passionate outdoorsman who spends much of his time on Idahoâ€™s public lands. He is a business-minded, Republican leader in the Idaho House who fights to keep Idaho home for all of its residents.
