Kevin Andrus is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Idaho House of Representatives, representing District 35A. He assumed office on December 1, 2022, and his current term ends on December 1, 2024.

Born in Pocatello, Idaho, Kevin was raised on a sheep and cattle ranch outside of Lava Hot Springs. This early exposure to ranch life instilled in him a deep appreciation for agriculture and rural living. He attended Marsh Valley High School and later pursued higher education at Brigham Young University (Idaho), where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Agriculture Business. Furthering his education, he obtained an MBA from Idaho State University.

In addition to his academic pursuits, Kevin served a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the country of Panama. This experience enriched his worldview and strengthened his commitment to service.

Kevin's professional life is as diverse as it is impressive. He has worked as the manager of Andrus Ranch, a loan officer with Ireland Bank, a business consultant with Idaho State University, and a horse trainer with Life Skills Recovery Ranch. These roles have equipped him with a unique blend of skills and experiences, making him an effective legislator.

In the Idaho House of Representatives, Kevin has been assigned to several committees, including the House Agricultural Affairs Committee, the Business Committee, and the House State Affairs Committee. His work in these committees reflects his commitment to his constituents and his dedication to improving the state of Idaho.

Kevin is not just a public servant; he is also a family man. He and his wife, Shelby, are the proud parents of five children. They currently reside on the same ranch where Kevin was raised, continuing the tradition of rural living.

Kevin's journey is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and commitment to serving his community. As he continues his work in the Idaho House of Representatives, he carries with him the lessons learned from the ranch, the mission field, and the various roles he has undertaken in his professional life.
