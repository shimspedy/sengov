Charlie Shepherd was raised in Garden Valley, Idaho. He is a graduate of Salmon River High School, Riggins, Idaho. Before his political career, Shepherd spent 10 years logging in Idaho, Utah, Oregon, and Washington. He also worked for 15 years for a family-owned sawmill and log home business.

In addition to his work experience, Shepherd served as a maintenance supervisor at Salmon River Joint School District. He has a strong connection with sports and coached high school football, basketball, and track at Salmon River High School for 18 years. He is a current member of the District III Basketball Officials Association.

Shepherd's political journey began when he was elected to the seat after incumbent Republican Paul Shepherd, his father, decided not to run for re-election after holding the seat from 2012 to 2020. He ran unopposed in the general election.

During his tenure, Shepherd has been assigned to several committees. In the 2023-2024 term, he served on the Senate Commerce and Human Resources Committee as Vice Chair and was also a member of the Senate Education Committee. In the 2021-2022 term, he was assigned to the Business Committee, House Education Committee, and Transportation and Defense Committee.
