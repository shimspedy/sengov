Jon Weber is an American politician and businessman who is currently serving as a member of the Idaho House of Representatives from the 34th district. He assumed office on December 1, 2020.

Weber was raised in Michigan and studied business at Ricks College and Utah State University. Although he did not earn a degree, he has owned and operated several businesses and has a rich career in public service.

Before his election to the Idaho House of Representatives, Weber served as chairman of the Madison County Commission. His leadership and dedication to public service were evident during his tenure.

In November 2020, Weber was elected to the Idaho House of Representatives, succeeding Doug Ricks. His election marked a new chapter in his career, and he has since been working diligently to represent the interests of his constituents.

On a personal note, Weber is married to Heather Cardon and they have five children. He has been self-employed for 30 years and has served on the board of directors for the Chamber of Commerce, Beehive Federal Credit Union, and the Idaho Association of County Commissioners and Clerks. He was also a member of the magistrate commission.

Weber's journey from Michigan to the Idaho House of Representatives is a testament to his dedication and commitment to public service. His work in both business and politics demonstrates his leadership skills and his desire to make a positive impact on his community.
