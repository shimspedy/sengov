Ted Hill, a member of the Republican Party, is a representative of the Idaho House of Representatives, representing District 14A. He assumed office on December 1, 2022, and his current term ends on December 1, 2024.

Born and raised in Boise, Idaho, Hill attended Boise High School and later graduated from Boise State University with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree. He furthered his education by completing a masterâ€™s degree in international relations from Salve-Regina University.

Hill's career is marked by a long and distinguished service in the U.S. Navy, which he joined in 1984. He served as a fighter pilot, completing three combat tours including Desert Storm, Southern Watch, and Iraqi Freedom. His roles in the Navy were diverse and significant, ranging from a squadron commander to an Airwing deputy commander. During his combat tours, he acted as a liaison to Arab countries on defense operations, training, and status of force negotiations. He also worked closely with alliance partners Great Britain, Australia, and Japan. After more than a decade of involvement with the Department of Defense in strategic war planning, force and weapon assessments, and recommendations, Hill retired in April of 2022 after completing 38 years of service with the Navy.

In addition to his military service, Hill has been affiliated with the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Military Officers Association of America. He is currently a contract adversary fighter pilot in support of naval aviator tactical training and an international pilot for United Airlines.

Hill ran for election to the Idaho House of Representatives to represent District 14A and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. As a legislator, he has sponsored several bills, although the details of these bills are not available at this time.

Hill's base salary as a legislator is $19,913 per year, with additional per diem allowances based on the distance of his residence from the capitol.
