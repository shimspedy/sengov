Nate Roberts is an American politician, electrician, and union officer. He has served as a Democratic member of the Idaho House of Representatives for legislative district 29B since 2022.

Born in Coos Bay, Oregon, Nate Roberts now resides in Pocatello, Idaho. His career spans over 32 years as an electrician, during which he worked in the western states and internationally on industrial, commercial, and residential construction projects.

Before his political career, Roberts was an educator specializing in workforce development at the College of Southern Idaho, where he taught electricians. He was also a union representative, and stated that he represented unions at the Capitol building annually since 2018.

Roberts was a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) union, and had previously served as president of the Pocatello Central Labor Council.

In 2022, Roberts ran to succeed Democrat James Ruchti as the member of the House of Representatives for legislative district 29B after Ruchti chose to run for state senate. As a candidate, he emphasized affordable housing, preventing legislative overreach from far-right ideologies, and reproductive rights as key issues.

Roberts faced Republican candidate Jake Stevens in the general election. He ultimately won the election by a narrow margin. Roberts' margin of victory over his Republican opponent came out to less than 150 votes, making it one of the closest races of the election.

After taking office, he joined the Health and Welfare, Commerce and Human Resources, and Agricultural Affairs committees.

In his personal life, Roberts has been married to his wife Kirsten for 36 years, with whom he has two sons.
