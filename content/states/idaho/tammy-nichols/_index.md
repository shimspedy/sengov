Tammy Nichols, born in February 1976, is an American politician and speaker serving as a member of the Idaho Senate for District 10. She is also a co-chair of the Idaho Freedom Caucus.

Nichols was born and raised in Boise, Idaho. She graduated from Boise High School in 1994 and later pursued her higher education at Brigham Young University–Idaho, where she graduated with a degree in science.

Before her political career, Nichols gained experience in the banking and medical industries. She started working at the age of six in her family’s businesses in Boise. She is a current precinct committeeman in Canyon County and has been a community volunteer.

In 2018, Nichols ran for the open Idaho House of Representatives District 11 Seat B. She defeated four candidates; Kirk Adams, Scott R Brock, David L Lincoln, and Kathryn Ralstin with 38.9% of the vote. Nichols then defeated Democratic nominee Brian A. Ertz with 77.6% of the vote.

In 2020, Nichols retained her seat by defeating Democratic nominee Edward Savala with 79.8% of the vote. In 2022, Nichols ran for the state senate in District 10, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Solomon with 77.2% of the vote.

Nichols has been active in her political role. In January 2023, she sponsored SB1038, the Education Choice Act, a school choice bill. In February 2023, Nichols and Idaho Rep. Judy Boyle introduced HB 154, a bill that would make it a misdemeanor to provide or administer a vaccine developed using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology in any individual or mammal in the state. This would prohibit all mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and pre-emptively ban mRNA vaccines being developed as treatments for other illnesses. Nichols also sponsored a bill that would require the inclusion of "vaccine materials" in food to be labelled.

On a personal note, Nichols is a mother of five children. She and her family live in Middleton, Idaho. Nichols and her husband divorced in January 2019.
