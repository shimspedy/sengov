Cornel Rasor is an American politician who has represented district 1B in the Idaho House of Representatives since his appointment in September 2024. He replaced Sage Dixon, who resigned to accept a role as regional director for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Rasor received his appointment from Governor Brad Little and was endorsed by the Bonner County Republican Party.

Rasor was born in Jackson, California, and received an undergraduate degree from North Idaho College and the University of Idaho. As a high school student at Sandpoint High School in Idaho, he was a member of the Future Farmers of America. He grew up on a cattle ranch, which likely influenced his later political and professional endeavors.

In 2013, Rasor attracted controversy after remarking that he'd "hire a gay guy if I thought he was a good worker. But if he comes to work in a tutu … he’s not producing what I want in my office.” This statement sparked significant debate and brought attention to his views on workplace behavior and inclusivity.

Rasor announced his candidacy to represent District 7B in the Idaho House of Representatives on May 2nd, 2020. He expressed strong support for the second amendment and faced Charlie Shepherd in the Republican Party primary election on June 2, 2020. Rasor was defeated by Shepherd, receiving 48% of the vote to Shepherd's 52%.

In late 2023, Rasor filed paperwork to run for District 1B in the Idaho House of Representatives and officially declared his candidacy in May of 2024. He narrowly defeated Chuck Lowman in the Republican primary, winning by a margin of 4%. Rasor was endorsed by the Bonner County Republican Party.

Shortly after the Republican primaries, incumbent representative Sage Dixon announced that he would resign from his position to accept a role as a regional director for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. At the Bonner County Republican Central Committee meeting to endorse a replacement for Dixon, Rasor defeated Jane Sauter and Victoria Zeischegg. Governor Brad Little officially appointed him to the seat on September 28th.

Rasor's professional experience includes working as the manager of a retail Army surplus store in Sandpoint, Idaho. He began serving as an elected precinct committeeman with the Bonner County Republican Central Committee in 1996. He served as the chair of the Bonner County Central Committee from 2008 to 2012, and he served as the state parliamentarian at conventions and meetings. He began serving as the Idaho Legislative District 7 chair in 2012. Rasor served as an elected county commissioner from 2009 to 2013, and he served as county commissioner chair from 2011 to 2012. Rasor has also served as an elder in his local church, and he is affiliated with the NRA.

In the 2024 general election for Idaho House of Representatives District 1B, Rasor defeated Kathryn Larson, securing 71.1% of the vote. His current term ends on December 1, 2026. Rasor's political career has been marked by his strong support for conservative values and his active involvement in local and state politics. He continues to serve his constituents with a focus on issues such as the second amendment, local government, and health and welfare.
