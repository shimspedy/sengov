Abby Lee, born in 1971/72, is a dedicated and accomplished public servant who has been a Republican member of the Idaho Senate representing District 9 since 2014. She succeeded Monty Pearce and has been serving the constituents of her district with commitment and integrity.

Lee was born and raised in Idaho, and she continues to reside in Fruitland, Idaho with her husband Brian and their two daughters. Her roots in the community and her understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities it presents have been instrumental in her work as a senator.

In terms of education, Lee is highly qualified. She holds a Bachelor’s degree in communications from Brigham Young University and a Master’s degree in instructional and performance technology from Boise State University. She is also in the process of completing a PhD in public policy and administration at Boise State University.

Over the years, Lee has served on several committees in the Idaho Senate. She was a member of the Agriculture Affairs Committee from 2014 to 2016 and the Commerce and Human Resources Committee from 2014 to 2015. Currently, she is a part of the Finance, Health and Welfare, and Judiciary and Rules committees.

Lee's commitment to public service extends beyond her role as a senator. She was the Co-chair of the Foster Care Study Legislative Interim Committee in 2016 and 2017, and was appointed Co-chair of the Legislature’s new Child Protection Oversight Committee in 2018. She was also named the 2018 Idaho Mother of Achievement.

In addition to her legislative duties, Lee is employed as the Associate Vice President of College and Public Relations at Treasure Valley Community College. She is also a member of the Saint Alphonsus Medical Center Ontario Community Board and was the president of Ontario Kiwanis from 2010 to 2012.

Throughout her career, Lee has demonstrated a deep commitment to her community and to the state of Idaho. Her work in the Idaho Senate and her involvement in various committees and community organizations reflect her dedication to public service and her desire to make a positive impact on the lives of the people she serves.
