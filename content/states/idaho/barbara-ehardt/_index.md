Barbara Ehardt is an American politician and former college basketball coach. She is currently serving as a member of the Idaho House of Representatives from the 33rd district.

Born and raised in Idaho Falls, Idaho, Ehardt attended North Idaho College and Idaho State University on a basketball scholarship. This passion for the game led her to a 15-year college coaching career that provided many rich and unique experiences. She worked as the head women's basketball coach at California State University, Fullerton, before returning to her hometown of Idaho Falls, Idaho, in 2003.

In addition to her coaching career, Ehardt has also been involved in various other sports-related activities. She owns and operates Coach Eâ€™s Camps and Clinics and runs a highly successful travel basketball program for high school boys, with five players going on to play collegiately. She also conducts leadership forums and works as a motivational speaker, including EFY (Especially for Youth) through BYU, YES (Youth Education through Sports) clinics at the NCAA Final Four, as well as many other events.

Ehardt's political career began when she was appointed to the Idaho House of Representatives on December 27, 2017. She has since been re-elected and her current term ends on December 1, 2024. During her tenure, Ehardt has been involved in several key pieces of legislation. She authored a bill that would restrict statewide sex education and sponsored a bill that would require transgender athletes to play on teams corresponding to the gender they were assigned at birth. This bill has attracted significant criticism, both within Idaho and nationally.

Despite the controversy, Ehardt continues to serve her constituents and remains a prominent figure in Idaho politics. Her dedication to public service and her commitment to the people of Idaho are evident in her work both on and off the basketball court.
