Megan Blanksma is an American politician serving as a member of the Idaho House of Representatives from District 8 in seat B. She is a member of the Republican Party.

Born and raised in Nampa, Idaho, Blanksma graduated from Nampa High School and served as a legislative page in the Idaho Senate during her senior year. She earned a Bachelor of Science in economics from the University of Idaho.

Before her political career, Blanksma owned an agribusiness and worked as a farmer. She has been involved with the Idaho Republican Party as a precinct committee person, a state committeewoman, and the chairwoman of the Elmore County Central Committee.

Blanksma challenged 14-year incumbent Pete Nielsen in the Republican primary in 2016. She was endorsed by Governor Butch Otter. After securing the nomination, Blanksma faced only independent and third party opposition in the general election and was elected to the seat.

She served as the Majority Leader in the House of Representatives from 2022 to February 8, 2024, when she was removed due to disagreements within the Republican Caucus. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Blanksma criticized the Idaho Central District Health for endorsing a statement by Lauren McLean, the Democratic mayor of Boise, who supported Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance regarding masking and vaccines.

Blanksma and her husband, Jeff, live on a farm in Hammett, Idaho.
