Heather Scott is an American biologist, businesswoman, and politician serving as a Republican member of the Idaho House of Representatives representing District 2A. She was born in Ohio and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in biology from the University of Akron.

Scott was employed in the field of fisheries and aquatic biology for over 15 years related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission re-licensing and operations of hydroelectric facilities. In 2015, Scott is reported to have cut wires which were part of the fire-suppression system in her office. Scott believed at the time that the wires were in fact listening devices planted to spy on her.

In August 2017, Scott defended white nationalism on her Facebook page. At the start of the 2017 legislative session, Scott reportedly made a remark to fellow state representative Judy Boyle, upon learning of her appointment to the state legislature's agriculture committee. The reported comment was that female lawmakers obtain ranking committee appointments and other leadership positions only if they "spread their legs."

In the 2019 legislative session, Scott sponsored a bill that would have required Idaho's Child Protective Services to mirandize parents before assessing them or their children. After passing the House, the bill was held in committee in the Senate. In 2019, it was reported that Scott was a member of the Coalition of Western States (COWS), a group founded by Washington state representative Matt Shea that has been accused of involvement in domestic terrorism.

In 2020, she dismissed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming the virus was trying to kill the U.S. Constitution and "The lying, Trump-hating media who continues to push global and socialist agendas has told us that there is an emergency." In April 2021 it was reported that Scott claimed the book To Kill a Mockingbird was an example of critical race theory in schools.

In 2021, Scott sought a copy of the police report accusing fellow state republican Aaron von Ehlinger of rape and asked the victim's legal representative how a person who files a false police report alleging sexual assault could be charged with a crime.
