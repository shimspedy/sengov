John Vander Woude is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Idaho House of Representatives from the 22A district. He has also served as House majority caucus leader since 2013. He previously represented the 21A district in the House from 2006 to 2008.

John Vander Woude was born in Paramount, California. After graduating high school, he served in the United States Army from 1968 until 1970. After his military service, Vander Woude worked as a dairy farmer until he retired. He was a member of the Nampa Christian School Board for 16 years and also served on the boards of the United Dairymen of Idaho, Milk Producers of Idaho, and Idaho Dairy Herd Improvement Association.

He was first elected to the Idaho House of Representatives in 2006 and served until he was defeated by Rich Jarvis by 65 votes in 2008. He was re-elected to his old seat in 2010. Vander Woude's district was adjusted after the 2010 United States census, and he has won re-election in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020.

Vander Woude's daughter, Lori Den Hartog, is a member of the Idaho Senate. This marked the first time a father and daughter have served together in the Idaho legislature.

In addition to his political career, Vander Woude has been a small business owner and a farmer in Nampa for more than 40 years. He has served on several committees during his tenure in the Idaho House of Representatives, including the Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee, the Senate Agricultural Affairs Committee, the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, and the House Health and Welfare Committee.
