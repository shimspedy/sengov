His political career began when he ran for the first of four terms and served as precinct committeeman for the Elmore County Republican Party. He was elected vice-chair of the county party in 2014 and served as Legislative District 23 Chair from 2014-2016.

Schroeder is an atheist. He supports more power for local governments rather than inflexible state mandates. He believes in the importance of local decision-making and the unique needs of each community.
