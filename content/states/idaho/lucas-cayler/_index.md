Lucas Cayler, a dedicated public servant and proud Idahoan, was born in Nampa, Idaho. Raised near Parma, he was home educated from kindergarten through 12th grade. In 1999, Lucas joined the U.S. Navy, where he served with distinction for a decade. His first duty station was aboard the USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74) based out of San Diego, California. During his time in the Navy, he was deployed twice in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. His second duty station was aboard the USS Hopper (DDG-70) stationed out of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Throughout his military career, Lucas was trained in electronic and radar system maintenance and operation, earning two Navy and Marine Corps achievement medals before being honorably discharged in 2009.

After his military service, Lucas transitioned to a civilian role as a contractor with BAE Systems, working for the Army's 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. In 2012, he returned to Idaho and joined Cobalt Truck Equipment in Nampa, where he has held various positions, including heavy truck mechanic, welder/fabricator, sales associate, and purchasing agent.

Lucas's commitment to his community and country led him to pursue a career in public service. In May 2024, he was elected as a precinct committeeman for District 11, Precinct 23. Later that year, he successfully ran for the Idaho House of Representatives, representing District 11B. He assumed office on December 1, 2024, and his current term will end on December 1, 2026. Lucas is running for re-election in the 2026 election.

As a state representative, Lucas serves on several committees, including Commerce & Human Resources, Health & Welfare, and Local Government. He is passionate about preserving Idahoans' freedoms and ensuring that the government remains accountable to the people. Lucas believes in the importance of conservative and moral leadership, grounded in godly principles, to protect the rights and interests of all Idahoans.

Lucas resides in Caldwell, Idaho, where he enjoys spending time in the great outdoors, camping, fishing, and hunting. His dedication to his family, community, and country continues to drive his efforts to make Idaho a better place for all its residents.
