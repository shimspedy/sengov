Jason A. Monks was born in 1967 or 1968 in Ridgecrest, California. He is an American politician serving as a member of the Idaho House of Representatives from District 22. Monks served as assistant majority leader from 2019 to 2022 and was selected as majority leader in February 2024.

Monks earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Brigham Young University. His professional experience includes working for ZiLOG as Environmental Health and Safety Manager, working at a hazardous waste remediation company, and owning two small businesses.

In terms of his political career, Monks has had a series of successful elections. In 2012, with Republican Representative Pete Nielsen redistricted to 23B, Monks won the four-way Republican Primary, defeating former Representative Fred Tilman. Monks won the General election with a significant majority against Democratic nominee Sharon Fisher.

In 2014 and 2016, Monks was unopposed in both the Republican primary and the general election. In 2018, Monks defeated Ronald DeBlauw in the Republican primary with a significant majority of the vote and was unopposed in the general election. In 2020, Monks defeated Hedi Sorenon in the Republican primary with a majority of the vote.

Monks has been married to his high school sweetheart Shelley for almost 30 years. Jason and Shelley are blessed to have eight children, four of which are adopted, and 7 grandchildren. One of the reasons Jason is running for office is because he wants his children and grandchildren to be able to enjoy Idahoâ€™s greatness for years to come.
