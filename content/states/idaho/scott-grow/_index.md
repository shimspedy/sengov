Cecil Scott Grow, known as C. Scott Grow, was born on May 5, 1948, in Moscow, Idaho, United States. He grew up in Boise, Idaho. As a young man, he served as a missionary in the Southeast Mexican Mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). After his mission, Grow received a bachelor's degree in accounting from Brigham Young University. He then worked for several accounting firms before founding his own accounting partnership.

In terms of his service to the LDS Church, Grow has held numerous positions. He has served as a counselor in a stake presidency, stake president, and regional representative. From 1988 to 1991, he was president of the church's Uruguay Montevideo Mission. As an area seventy from 1995 to 2005, he was in the presidency of both the church's North America Northwest and Idaho areas. During this time, he was president of the Idaho Area from 2001 to 2003, one of only three non-general authorities to have served as an area president. In 2005, Grow became a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy where he served as a counselor and as president of the Mexico North Area, as well as a counselor in the Mexico Area. Grow also served as a counselor in the presidency of the South America Northwest Area. In 2016, Grow participated with Dieter F. Uchtdorf in a ceremonial cornerstone sealing at the new Fort Collins Colorado Temple. On October 6, 2018, Grow was designated an emeritus general authority.

In the political sphere, Grow has been the State Senator for Idaho's District 14 since his appointment in August 2018. He succeeded Marv Hagedorn, who had resigned before the end of his term after Governor Butch Otter appointed him to serve in his administration. In February 2018, Grow announced his candidacy to run for the senate seat in Idaho Legislative District 14 after the incumbent, Marv Hagedorn, announced he was seeking the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor, instead of running for reelection. The Legislative District 14 Republican Central Committee sent three names in order of preference to Otter to fill the vacancy, with Grow as their first recommendation. As a senator, Grow serves on the Finance, and Local Government and Taxation committees.

Scott Grow is a retired CPA and business owner. He brings more than three decades of business, financial, and tax expertise to the legislature. He was elected twice to the Meridian School Board. He and his wife, Rhonda, raised their eight children in Meridian.
