Born and raised in Sandy, Utah, Cullimore's educational journey began at Utah Valley University where he received an Associate’s Degree in music.

Cullimore returned to Utah to work for the practice established by his father which focuses on property management, fair housing, collections and real property. In his spare time, he continues to volunteer his time to music and education as a Chairman of the Board for the Suzuki String Institute, Accompanist for the elementary school choir, former Co-Chair for the Brookwood Elementary School Community Council, and Board member for the Utah Valley University Alumni Association.
