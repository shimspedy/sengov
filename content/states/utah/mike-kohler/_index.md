Mike L. Kohler is an American politician serving as a member of the Utah House of Representatives from the 59th district. He was elected in November 2020 and assumed office on January 1, 2021.

Kohler was born and raised in Midway, Utah. After a few years of college, he returned home to run the family dairy farm due to the illness of his father. He studied agricultural economics and dairy science at Utah State University before returning home to his family's farm. Kohler later studied economics at the University of Utah.

In 1997, when the business could not grow enough to take care of everyone involved, Mike sold his portion of the farm to family pursuing other interests. He has since managed the Midway Irrigation Company. He was also a member of the Wasatch County Commission.

Kohler operated a farm before selling his ownership share to family members. His career experience includes working as a public policy advisor and owning a business. He was elected to the Utah House of Representatives in November 2020 and assumed office on January 1, 2021.

As a member of the Utah House of Representatives, Kohler has been assigned to various committees including the House Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Committee, and the Political Subdivisions Committee. He ran for re-election to the Utah House of Representatives to represent District 59 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. His current term ends on January 1, 2025.
