Rosalba Dominguez, a member of the Democratic Party, serves in the Utah House of Representatives, representing District 35. She assumed office on January 1, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 1, 2027.

Rosalba Dominguez has dedicated her career to public service and community empowerment. As a first-generation Mexican-American, she has drawn inspiration from her upbringing and the values instilled by her working-class parents. Her journey into politics began with her historic election to the Murray City Council, where she became the first Latina to serve in that capacity. Her tenure on the council was marked by her commitment to bridging gaps and creating accessible pathways for individuals navigating complex systems.

Dominguez's educational background includes an associate degree in graphic design from Salt Lake Community College and a bachelor's degree in film and video production from the Brooks Institute of Photography. Her professional experience as a small business owner has further shaped her understanding of the challenges faced by entrepreneurs and the importance of fostering economic opportunities.

In her role as a state representative, Dominguez has continued to champion initiatives that reflect her dedication to community advancement. She serves on several legislative committees, including the General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, the House Public Utilities, Energy, and Technology Committee, and the House Transportation Committee. Her legislative efforts have included sponsoring bills such as the Diaper Program Amendments and advocating for resolutions like the Dr. Martha Hughes Cannon Commemorative Stamp.

Rosalba Dominguez's leadership is not only a testament to her personal achievements but also a reflection of the growing Latino population in Utah, which now constitutes 15% of the state's demographic. Her presence in the Utah House of Representatives, alongside three other Latina representatives, underscores the importance of diverse representation in government. Dominguez views her role as a profound privilege and an opportunity to give back to the communities that have shaped her journey. Through her work, she continues to inspire and empower individuals, fostering meaningful relationships and driving positive change.
