Candice Pierucci is an American politician who is currently serving in the Utah House of Representatives. She represents District 49, which includes portions of Herriman and Riverton, Utah. At the time of her appointment, she was the youngest member of the Utah Legislature.

Candice Pierucci lives in Riverton and grew up in Herriman. She graduated from Utah Valley University with a bachelor's degree in political science, and later earned a masters' in public administration from the University of Utah.

Before her appointment to the legislature, Pierucci interned in the Washington, D.C. office of Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, worked for Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, and served as development director for the Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank. She currently serves as chair of the Utah House Education Committee.

In her personal life, Candice Pierucci is married to Andy Pierucci and they have one child. She has lived in House District 49 for over eighteen years and has seen it transform from mostly farmland and neighborhoods to a district of tremendous growth and opportunity. Candice and her husband have chosen to raise their family in the South Valley, a community she loves and is passionate about.

Candice Pierucci is a firm believer in the principles of conservatism, free-markets, and the power of community. In an era of government handouts and “democratic socialists,” she is uniquely qualified to reduce the burden of government and share the message of compassionate conservatism. As a representative, she is committed to working with and for her constituents.

She has also worked as Director of Community Relations for Congressman Chris Stewart, and most recently has been the development director for a conservative think tank that focuses on faith, family, and free-markets. She has served as a Board Member and Flight Leader for Utah Honor Flight, Vice President of Professional Republican Women, Vice Chair of the UFCRs, and over the years has worked on presidential, congressional, and local campaigns.
