Rosemary T. Lesser is an American politician and physician from Utah. Since January 2021, she has served as a member of the Utah House of Representatives from the 10th district. She is a member of the Democratic party and resides in Ogden, Utah, U.S. She received her education from the University of Notre Dame (BS) and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (MD).

Lesser is a member of several committees including the Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee, Retirement and Independent Entities Appropriations Subcommittee, House Health and Human Services Committee, and House Political Subdivisions Committee. She announced that she will sponsor legislation to remove the sales tax on food in the 2022 legislative session.

Before her political career, Lesser dedicated her life to service. She was a member of the first class of women to be admitted to the University of Notre Dame. After graduation, she was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Air Force. She continued her education at the nation’s only military medical school where she earned her medical degree. She went on to specialize in OB/GYN and served military members and their families in Germany and Texas.

After 15 years in the Air Force, Rosemary and her family moved to Ogden. From 1992 to 2020, she worked as an OB/GYN doctor in the Ogden Women's Clinic, Ogden Regional Medical Center, and McKay-Dee Hospital. Additionally, she and her husband Dave, also a physician, have served as volunteers with the Ouelessebougou Alliance, providing surgical care to people in Mali, West Africa. They also joined Notre Dame’s medical team to provide emergency medical services in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.

Rosemary was at her last day of work as a doctor on December 30, 2020, when she got the call informing her that Representative Lou Shurtliff had tragically passed away. Representative Shurtliff had just won reelection as the Democratic representative in the Utah legislature for House District 10, which included parts of Ogden and South Ogden. Rosemary was asked to run for the seat. She answered the call to serve, and after she was selected by the Weber County Democratic state delegates, she was appointed by Governor Cox to finish Representative Shurtliff's term.

Rosemary brings to the Legislature a veteran’s well-honed skills of quality leadership and management, adaptability, and the attitude that lasting success is shared success. Her work in the House is driven by the same sense of service that motivated her to join the military as she strives to address the problems facing our community and our state. As the only Democratic veteran and one of the few physicians in the Legislature, she brings a unique perspective and valuable experiences to the table in advocating for the people of District 10.

Rosemary and her husband Dave have six children and ten grandchildren. They love sailing in bodies of water large and small, from the Pacific Ocean to Willard Bay. You’ll often find Rosemary hiking the trails of the Wasatch Mountains. When not outside, she and Dave are often attending community theater and music concerts. Most recently she has taken up pickleball and plays with the legislative team from the Utah House who are all very gracious in accepting a rookie.
