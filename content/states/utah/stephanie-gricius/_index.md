Stephanie Gricius Bennion is a member of the Utah House of Representatives, representing District 50. She is a member of the Republican Party and assumed office on January 1, 2023. Her current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Stephanie Gricius lives in Eagle Mountain, Utah. Her career experience includes owning and operating a small, custom manufacturing company with her husband, Chris. She has also worked as a realtor and is an entrepreneur.

Gricius was elected to the Eagle Mountain City Council in 2015 and served until 2020. During her tenure, she was instrumental in bringing Facebook and Tyson Foods to Eagle Mountain, organized much-needed fire fuels mitigation projects, supported removing red tape for small businesses, and attended Mountainland Association of Governments meetings to help ensure Eagle Mountain had a voice in how regional transportation dollars were spent.

In addition to her political career, Gricius has been serving her community since she was 14, starting as a volunteer t-ball coach for the YMCA. In 2014, she saw a need in her community as the Utah Legislature debated relocating the state prison to Eagle Mountain and dedicated her time and energy to help lead the opposition.

Gricius and her husband, Chris, have owned and operated a small company specializing in custom manufacturing equipment and processes since 2009. During this time, they have been able to help clients streamline their processes by designing, building, and maintaining machinery to fit individual needs. This allowed clients to bring multiple lines of manufacturing home to Utah from other countries.

She is also a licensed Realtor. While serving on the City Council, she fell in love with the process of designing and creating both residential and commercial developments.

Gricius and her family moved to Eagle Mountain in 2010 where they currently reside with their five children, two dogs, seven ducks, and an assortment of reptiles and small animals. As a foster family, theyâ€™ve opened their home and their hearts to children from hard places and balance the needs of those children with their own.

Gricius loves traveling and learning about other cultures, hunting and shooting, water sports, relaxing with friends, crafting, and date nights with her husband.
