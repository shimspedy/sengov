Angela Romero is an American politician and the Democratic leader of the Utah House of Representatives. She represents the 25th District since January 1, 2023. Prior to redistricting, she represented the 26th District since January 1, 2013.

Born and raised in Tooele, Utah, Angela was raised by her grandparents. Their dedication to raising a hard-working, well-educated woman inspired her to pursue college. She graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and a Master’s Degree in Public Administration from the University of Utah.

In 2012, she won election to represent House District 26 at the Utah Legislature. From 2016-2020, she was elected by her colleagues to serve as the House Democratic Assistant Whip. Angela was recently elected by her colleagues from across the country to serve as the President-Elect of the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators.

Her upbringing, paired with her education, gives Angela a unique perspective into the needs of Utah’s diverse communities. Angela works on legislation that provides a voice for sexual assault, domestic violence, and human trafficking survivors. Her work includes sponsoring the Prison Rape Elimination Act and securing 3.6 million dollars for the Statewide Sexual Assault and Interpersonal Violence Prevention Program.

Angela also sponsored legislation creating the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girl Task Force in Utah which she now co-chairs with Senator Dave Hinkins. She was also the chief sponsor of HB175 which allows individuals to petition the court to include pets on a personal protective order or stalking injunction, granting them a legal layer of protection from abusers.

Outside of her work on sexual assault, domestic violence and human trafficking prevention, Angela was instrumental in passing important police reform legislation. During the 2021 session, she successfully sponsored Peace Officer Training Amendments, Use of Force Reporting Requirements and Law Enforcement Weapons Use. These bills stemmed from meetings between BIPOC community leaders, legislators, and law enforcement.

When not fulfilling her legislative duties, Angela works for Salt Lake City Corporation. She oversees community programs and initiatives in the Division of Youth and Family Services, including supervising the YouthCity Government and My Brother’s Keeper Programs. Angela is committed to public service and has been a city employee for over 21 years.

Angela has received several recognitions and honors for her work, including the NAACP President’s Award in 2022, the Legislative Coalition for People with Disabilities
