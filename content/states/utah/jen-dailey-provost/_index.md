Jennifer Dailey-Provost is an American politician serving as a member of the Utah House of Representatives from the 22nd district. She was elected in November 2018 and assumed office on January 1, 2019.

She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing from the David Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah and an MBA from Westminster College. She also earned a graduate certificate in international business from Westminster College and a graduate certificate in emergency health and public health from the University of Utah School of Medicine.

Before her political career, Dailey-Provost was the executive director of Utah Academy of Family Physicians, where she lobbied for family medicine and primary care. In the 2018 general election for the Utah House of Representatives, she defeated Republican candidate Scott Rosenbush, with 77% of the vote.

In 2019, Rep. Dailey-Provost sponsored end-of-life legislation in the 2019 legislative session, but the bill did not receive a hearing. In 2022, she tried again, but the bill was defeated 2-9 in committee. In 2021, Rep. Dailey-Provost sponsored a bill that would "allow women held in jails to be able to stay on their prescribed birth control, with the goal to prevent unwanted pregnancies". The bill passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Cox into law.

Dailey-Provost lives in the Avenues with her husband Scott and three daughters. She began her career as the Director of Human Resources at Solitude Mountain Resort, but ultimately found professional fulfillment in the non-profit sector. Currently, she works to serve HD22 in the Utah House of Representatives, but is also pursuing her PhD in Public Health at the University of Utah. Her first priority, though is raising her three daughters with her husband.

She is the former executive director of the Utah Academy of Family Physicians in Salt Lake City where she managed the business of the 501 (c) (6), as well as the UAFP Foundation, a 501 (c) (3) that is focused on medical education in underserved areas. Additionally, she served primary care and public health functions as the director of governmental affairs and policy, prioritizing policies like patient access to health care, social determinants of health, air quality, education, and reproductive rights. It was her work in healthcare and public health advocacy that motivated her run to serve in elected office.

Jen and her family love the quality of life that Utah offers and take advantage of the incredible access to the outdoors whenever possible. She is most passionate about skiing and running, but Jen also loves to hike, bike, snowshoe, and knit cozy things.
