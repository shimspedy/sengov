Stephanie Pitcher is an American politician, attorney, and a member of the Utah State Senate. She is a representative of the 14th district and assumed office on January 1, 2023. Prior to her current role, she served two terms as a member of the Utah House of Representatives from the 40th district, from 2019 through 2022.

Pitcher's educational background includes a Bachelor of Arts degree in English creative writing from Utah State University and a Master of Public Administration (MPA) from the University of Utah. She also earned a Juris Doctor from the S.J. Quinney College of Law in 2015.

In 2016, Pitcher co-founded the Utah Women's Coalition, an organization that promotes legislation on issues such as family leave, protection of breastfeeding in public, and child care. In addition to her political career, Pitcher is a prosecutor for Davis County, Utah.

In 2018, Pitcher ran against Republican Peter L. Kraus for a seat in the Utah House of Representatives and won with 70% of the vote. In 2020, she introduced cash bail reform legislation that was passed by the Utah legislature and signed by Governor Spencer Cox in 2021. The bill introduced requirements that bail decisions reflect risk factors, with the goal of preventing people who posed little threat to society from spending unnecessary time in prison because they were unable to pay bail.

Outside of her political and legal career, Pitcher is an avid chess player and is ranked as a Woman Candidate Master (WCM). She has won the Utah State Women's Chess Championship eight times. She is also an enthusiast of Utah's mountains and trails and enjoys hiking, pickleball, and kayaking.
