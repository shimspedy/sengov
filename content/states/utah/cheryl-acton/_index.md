Cheryl K. Acton is an American politician who has been serving in the Utah House of Representatives, representing District 38. She was appointed to this position on September 18, 2017.

Acton was born and raised in Kansas before moving to Arizona for her senior year of high school. She now resides in West Jordan, Utah. She graduated from Brigham Young University with a BA in English.

Before her political career, Acton had a diverse professional background. She worked for the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Defense, where she earned the Meritorious Service Award. She has also been a freelance writer and editor, an independent contractor, an internet researcher, a newspaper reporter, and a teacher.

In September 2017, Rep. Adam Gardiner stepped down from his legislative post to become Salt Lake County Recorder. The votes to replace Gardiner were tied: Acton and Lyle Decker split the votes of 52 GOP delegates in the second round of voting, and the race was decided with a coin toss. Acton won reelection in 2018, defeating Democratic challenger Diane Lewis with 47.94 percent of the popular vote.

In the legislature, she has proposed and passed legislation restricting access to abortion. During the 2022 General Session, Acton served on the Executive Offices and Criminal Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, the House Health and Human Services Committee, and the House Judiciary Committee.

Acton and her husband, Scott, have four children, two sons and two daughters. As a family, they have traveled together to all 50 states. They have resided in West Jordan for the past 26 years.
