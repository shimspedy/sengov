Doug Fiefia is a first-generation American whose parents immigrated from Tonga to the United States in pursuit of the American Dream. Growing up in South Jordan, Utah, Doug demonstrated leadership early on, leading his high school football team to a state championship after a 60-year drought. He pursued higher education at Utah State University, earning dual bachelor's degrees in Marketing and Business Administration. During his time at Utah State, Doug served two terms as Student Body President and also led the Utah Student Association, representing over 300,000 higher education students to the Utah State Legislature and the Commissioner of Higher Education. Later, he furthered his education by obtaining an MBA from Rice University.

Professionally, Doug has built a diverse career. He has worked in technology sales, leading teams for prominent companies like Google and Workday. He is also the founder of a nonprofit organization, Raise The Tide, which focuses on empowering underrepresented minority groups to advance their careers, businesses, and personal lives. Additionally, Doug is a small business owner, running SOJO Construction, a company specializing in basement finishing and remodeling. The name of his company pays homage to South Jordan, the community where his family realized their American Dream.

Doug remains deeply connected to his community and alma mater. He serves on the Utah State University Foundation Board and actively participates in initiatives that support education and community development. In his personal life, Doug enjoys traveling, playing golf, and spending quality time with his wife, Jocelyn, and their four children.
