Stuart Adams, born in 1954 or 1955, is a prominent figure in Utah's political landscape. He is currently serving as the President of the Utah Senate, representing the 7th District. Prior to the redistricting, he represented the 22nd District.

Adams embarked on his political journey with an appointment to the Utah House of Representatives in 2002. He served the House until December 31, 2006. His dedication and leadership skills led to his appointment to the Senate in 2009. In 2012, he was chosen to be Senate Majority Whip, and in 2018, he ascended to the position of Senate President.

Adams is not just a politician; he is also a successful businessman. He graduated from Layton High in 1972 and earned his Bachelor of Arts at the University of Utah in business finance. His business acumen has been recognized with awards such as the Business Person of the Year by the Utah State Chamber of Commerce and the Builder of the Year by the Northern Wasatch Home Builders Association in 2002.

In his personal life, Adams is happily married to his wife, Susan, and they are proud parents of four children.

Adams has also served as the President of the Northern Wasatch Home Builders Association and as the chairman of the Utah State Transportation Commission. He was also the chairman of the Military Installation Development Authority (MIDA). Before his legislative service, Adams served 9 years on the Layton City Council.

During his tenure in the Utah State House of Representatives, Adams was named the 2004 Legislator of the Year by the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce, the 2004 Legislator of the Year by the International Code Council, and 2004 Representative of the Year by the Davis County Republican Women.

In 2016, Adams served as the Majority Whip. He also served on several committees including the Executive Appropriations Committee, Infrastructure and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee, Senate Business and Labor Committee, and Senate Transportation and Public Utilities and Technology Committee.

Adams has sponsored high-profile legislation dealing with energy and the environment. One of his notable bills, SB 246, proposed using public money from certain counties within the state to build a port in Oakland for shipping coal and other products, which Utah currently exports. This bill drew criticism from lawmakers in Oakland and environmentalists.

In September 2018, Adams played a crucial role in securing a $1.4 million appropriation for software from the Utah company Qualtrics.
