Rex Shipp is a member of the Utah House of Representatives, representing District 71. He assumed office on January 1, 2023. His current term ends on January 1, 2025. Shipp ran for re-election to the Utah House of Representatives to represent District 71 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Rex Shipp was born in Joseph, Utah. He currently resides in Cedar City, Utah. Shipp graduated from South Sevier High School in 1974. He earned a B.S. in industrial technology from Southern Utah University in 1981. His career experience includes working as a machine operator and manager at Morton Metalcraft and as a financial advisor with Cambridge Financial Center.

Shipp became a member of the Cedar City Chamber of Commerce, Rotary Club, the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, and the National Association of Health Underwriters.

During the 2022 General Session, Shipp served on the Higher Education Appropriations Subcommittee, House Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Committee, and House Public Utilities, Energy, and Technology Committee.

Shipp has advocated for gun-ownersâ€™ rights since he joined the Legislature in January 2019. Shipp has stated that he believes that the matter is not about gun control, but rather education; one of his bills, HB 258, would have created a three-year pilot program whereby students would be able to take a one-semester gun safety class by a qualified instructor and receive a semester hour of elective credit. The bill passed the Utah House by a vote of 47-21 but ultimately failed to pass the Senate.

Shipp has sponsored several legislations including UT HB0155 - Discharge of Fireworks Amendments, UT HB0158 - Criminal Defamation Amendments, UT HB0161 - School Board Amendments, and UT HB0113 - Rural County Jail Facilities Tax.
