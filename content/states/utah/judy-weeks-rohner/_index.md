Judy Weeks-Rohner is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Utah House of Representatives from the 30th district. She is a member of the Republican Party.

Before her political career in the Utah State Legislature, Weeks-Rohner was a member of the Granite School Board. She also served as the liaison to the State Board of Education under Governor Mike Leavitt.

In 2021, Weeks-Rohner led a signature-gathering effort to force a referendum on repealing a major tax reform package approved by the state legislature in 2019. This reform package cut income taxes and increased a per-child exemption but also increased taxes on food, fuel, and some services. However, the Legislature voted to repeal the tax reform bill before the referendum could take place.

After Craig Hall resigned his House seat to accept an appointment by Gov. Spencer Cox to serve as a state judge, Weeks-Rohner ran to replace him and won the special election. In the 2022 legislative session, Weeks-Rohner served on the Executive Offices and Criminal Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, House Education Committee, and the House Judiciary Committee.

Weeks-Rohner supports repealing the food tax in Utah. She criticized her fellow Republicans for not joining in supporting the food tax repeal proposal by Rosemary Lesser, saying, "I think theyâ€™re listening to big businesses and corporations, and I want them to listen to the common man."

She is currently running in a special election to the Utah State Senate to represent District 12. She declared her candidacy for the special Republican convention scheduled on April 27, 2024.
