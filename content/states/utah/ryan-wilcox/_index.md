Ryan D. Wilcox is an American politician who serves as a Representative in the Utah House of Representatives for District 7. He was recently re-elected to the position in 2021, having previously held the same seat from 2009 to 2015.

Wilcox was born and raised in Ogden, Utah and is a lifetime resident of Weber County. In 1999, he married Kristina Beckstrom, in the Latter-day Saint Bountiful Utah Temple. He is the father of five children. Wilcox graduated from Weber State University with a BA in Commercial Spanish and Political Science.

For the past decade, Wilcox has worked for Sprint Nextel Corporation managing retail stores. Under his leadership, stores have won several awards for sales performance and operational excellence.

In his political career, Wilcox has supported 2nd amendment protections cosponsoring HB 357, which strengthens Second Amendment rights regardless of conceal-carry status. He also sponsored HB 134, which helps facilitate the transfer of firearms that have federally mandated requirements to be transferred. Additionally, Wilcox has worked to protect 4th amendment rights sponsoring HB 128 which protects personal electronic devices from searches without a proper warrant.

Wilcox is also an advocate for knife rights, sponsoring HB 271 which restricts political subdivisions from issuing knife restrictions unless specifically authorized to do so. He has also received a great deal of press coverage for the opinion that certain changes need to be made to the Utah alcohol laws. He has run legislation that required improvements on the availability of reports brought from the Alcohol Abuse Tracking Committee to legislators so that it might be used more effectively.

During 2014, Wilcox served as Chair of the House Revenue and Taxation Committee and on the Business, Economic Development, and Labor Appropriations Subcommittee, The Commission on Federalism, The House Natural Resources and Environment Committee, and the Utah Tax Review Commission as well as several interim committees.

In national politics, Representative Wilcox has continuously supported the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty working with the congressional delegation from Utah and traveling to Washington to lobby for the effort.
