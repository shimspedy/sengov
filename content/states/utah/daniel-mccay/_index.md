Daniel McCay is an American politician and a Republican member of the Utah Senate representing District 18. Prior to redistricting, he represented District 11. He was in the Utah House of Representatives representing District 41 from 2013 through 2018. McCay was initially appointed by Republican Governor of Utah Gary Herbert to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Carl Wimmer.

McCay's political career includes being redistricted to District 41, and with incumbent Republican Representative Todd Kiser leaving the Legislature and leaving the seat open, McCay was chosen from two candidates by the Republican convention and was unopposed for the November 6, 2012 General election, winning with 13,658 votes. McCay was unopposed for the June 24, 2014 Republican Primary and won the November 4, 2014 General election with 6,685 votes (70.5%) against Democratic nominee Colleen Bliss.

During the 2016 legislative session, McCay served on the Higher Education Appropriations Subcommittee, the House Education Committee, and the House Revenue and Taxation Committee. During the interim, McCay serves on the Education Interim Committee and the Revenue and Taxation Interim Committee. He also works on the Legislative Information Technology Steering Committee and the Utah Tax Review Commission.

In 2020, McCay sponsored a bill that bans abortions for any reason besides rape, incest, or the mother’s health that goes into effect automatically if Roe v. Wade is overturned. In 2022 McCay was the sponsor for a bill that bans transgender women in women sports. In the 2023 session after working for 4 years McCay was the bill sponsor of SB 31, that changed the Utah flag and made the old flag a historical flag. This bill passed on March 2nd, 2023 and will formally replace the current flag in April 2024. In 2023, he received the Vexillonnaire Award from the North American Vexillological Association for "his leading role in the development and adoption of Utah’s new state flag, shepherding the four-year effort to update the Utah flag through the challenging conceptual, design, and legislative processes."

McCay lives in Riverton, Utah with his wife, Tawnee, and their six children. He received degrees at: Bachelors in Secondary Education, Utah State University; Masters in Instructional Design, Utah State University; J. D., Willamette University. McCay is currently an Attorney/Real Estate Portfolio Manager.
