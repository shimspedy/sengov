Keven J. Stratton is an American politician and a Republican member of the Utah House of Representatives representing District 58. Stratton was appointed on April 28, 2012, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Stephen Sandstrom. Between 2013 and 2023 he represented district 48. He lives in Orem, Utah.

Stratton earned his BS in finance from Brigham Young University and his JD from its J. Reuben Clark Law School. He has eight children, a scoutmaster, and has owned and operated small businesses in Utah County. He is a real estate, business, and estate-planning attorney. He is also a land developer and owner and operator of the Cascade Golf Course.

During the 2016 Legislative Session, he served on the Executive Offices and Criminal Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, the House Judiciary Committee, and the House Public Utilities, Energy, and Technology Committee. He has also taken a stand in favor of morality laws such as outlawing sex outside of marriage. He was one of 32 Utah Republicans who voted to keep extra-marital sex illegal in Utah.

In the 2014 elections, Stratton won against Timothy Spencer in the June 24, 2014 primary election and was unopposed for the general election on November 4, 2014 due to Janita Anderson (D) withdrawing before the primary.

Redistricted to District 48, and with incumbent Republican Representative LaVar Christensen redistricted to District 32, Stratton was chosen from among five candidates for the June 26, 2012, Republican primary which he won with 3,020 votes (54.7%); and was unopposed for the November 6, 2012, general election, winning with 13,237 votes.
