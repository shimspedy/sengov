Matt MacPherson is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 26 in the Utah House of Representatives. He assumed office on October 10, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025.

MacPherson was born in Las Vegas, Nevada. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Before his current tenure, MacPherson ran for election to represent District 31 in the Utah House of Representatives. However, he lost in the general election on November 3, 2020.

A significant event in his political career occurred on October 4, 2023. On this day, a Utah Republican delegation appointed MacPherson to the Utah House of Representatives District 26 to replace Quinn Kotter, a fellow member of the Republican Party. MacPherson was sworn into office just six days later, on October 10, 2023.

In addition to his political career, MacPherson is also a businessman from West Valley City, Utah. Interestingly, he is currently involved in a lawsuit with the state of Utah. The lawsuit dates back to last year when Salt Lake County imposed a COVID-19 mask mandate. According to court documents, MacPherson's children got on a bus one morning in January 2022 without masks. The driver contacted David Gatti, Granite School District transportation director, to resolve it. But MacPherson wasn't satisfied with the response, posting to Facebook that his daughter “was removed by force” from the bus by Gatti and had a medical exemption to allow her not to wear a mask. A few months later, Gatti sued for libel and slander, saying he was never even on the bus and that MacPherson was “intentionally and wrongfully smearing his name and reputation.” MacPherson then countersued, denying many of the allegations and arguing he “was engaged in constitutionally protected speech.” Today, the case is still playing out in court, and the state of Utah is helping represent Gatti.
