Joel Briscoe is a member of the Utah House of Representatives from Utah. A Democrat, he represents District 24 in Salt Lake City. He assumed office on January 1, 2023. His current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Briscoe graduated from the University of Utah and taught English, U.S. History, and Civics in secondary schools for twenty-six years, twenty-one of them at Bountiful High School. He served on the Salt Lake City Board of Education from 1998â€“2002, the last two years as the Board President. He also served as the chair of the East Central Community Council, a community council located between downtown Salt Lake and the University. In this capacity, Briscoe led community opposition to a proposal to install above-ground high voltage electrical transmission lines through neighborhood yards. He currently lives in Salt Lake City, Utah with his wife Christine and three children.

Briscoe was elected to the Utah House of Representatives on November 2, 2010 and has made education issues a focus of his legislative efforts. During the 2016 legislative session, Briscoe served as the House Assistant Minority Whip. He served on the Executive Appropriations Committee, the Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee, the House Revenue and Taxation Committee, as well as the House Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Committee. During the 2022 legislative session, Briscoe served on the Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee, the House Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment Committee, the House Revenue and Taxation Committee, Legislative Process Committee, and the Legislative Water Development Commission.

Briscoe supports policies aimed to limit pollution. He currently served as co-chair of the Clean Air Caucus in the Utah legislature. In 2021, Briscoe said he support government regulations to curb emissions, but also believes that private innovation to help fight emissions, "particularly through public-private partnerships and other incentives, is necessary to developing clean alternatives to our current polluting technology." In 2022, as part of an effort he believes he will help bring about cleaner air in Utah, Rep. Briscoe sponsored a bill that would make Utah Transit Authority services, including TRAX, the Frontrunner, and buses free throughout Utah.
