Ashlee Matthews Rohner is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She is currently serving as a representative in the Utah House of Representatives, representing District 37.

Born in West Valley, Utah, Matthews has dedicated her career to public service. Prior to her political career, she worked in the construction department of the Utah Department of Transportation since 2011. Her husband is a union pipe fitter and they have two children.

Matthews' political journey began when she ran for office on a platform to support working-class families. Her key issues included affordable day care, better public transportation, and livable wages. She is also a strong supporter of congressional term limits.

In November 2020, Matthews was the leading vote getter, receiving 6,114 votes, over incumbent Eric Hutchings who had held the position for 18 years. Hutchings received 5,733 votes. This victory marked a significant milestone in her political career.

During the 2022 General Session, Matthews served on several committees including the Business, Economic Development, and Labor Appropriations Subcommittee, House Business and Labor Committee, House Transportation Committee, and the Occupational and Professional Licensure Review Committee.

In addition to her work in the Utah Department of Transportation, Matthews has also co-founded The Single Parent Project and served as its director of events. She has served as a mentor with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Utah and a Giving Tree coordinator for the UA Local 140 Ladies Auxiliary.

Matthews continues to serve her constituents with dedication and commitment, striving to make a positive impact in her community and the state of Utah.
