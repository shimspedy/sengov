Casey Snider is an American politician serving as a member of the Utah House of Representatives from the 5th district. He was elected in 2018 and assumed office on January 1, 2019.

Snider was raised in Liberty, Utah. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in conservation and restoration ecology, law, and constitutional studies from Utah State University and a Master of Science in environmental science and policy from Johns Hopkins University.

After earning his master's degree, Snider worked in the field of environmental and natural resources policy, commuting between Utah and Washington, D.C. He worked as a legislative director for Rob Bishop and was a staffer on the United States House Committee on Natural Resources. He is the executive director of the Bear River Land Conservancy. Snider has also worked as a rancher and volunteer firefighter in Cache County, Utah.

Snider was elected to the Utah House of Representatives in 2018. When he assumed office on January 1, 2019, he became one of the youngest members of the House.

Snider and his wife, Kelli, have one daughter. They live in Avon, Utah. Snider is a northern Utah native by blood and marriage. He grew up in Liberty, on land his family homesteaded 150 years ago. He married the Cache County Dairy Princess, and the two live together in a buttermilk-colored bungalow in Paradise with their 4-year-old daughter and more goats in the yard than Snider would prefer.
