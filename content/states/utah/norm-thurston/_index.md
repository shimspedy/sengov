Norm Thurston, born on October 4 in Ogden, Utah, is an American politician and a Republican member of the Utah House of Representatives representing District 62. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Thurston received a BA in Spanish and Agricultural Economic Analysis from Brigham Young University. He then went on to Princeton University where he received both an MS and PhD in Economics. Thurston resides in Provo, Utah with his wife Maria. Together they have three children and three grandchildren.

He is currently the Director for the Office of Health Care Statistics which is the agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about health care cost and quality for the State of Utah.

During the 2020 election of district 64, Thurston won with 100% of the vote as all other challengers withdrew. In a previous election, Thurston defeated William Snider, Ben Summerhalder and Karen Ellingson in the Republican convention and won the November 4, 2014 General election against Democratic nominee Scott Ellis Ferrin and Independent American nominee Jason Christensen with 2,635 votes (67.8%).

During the 2022 General Session, Thurston served on the Social Services Appropriations Subcommittee, House Business and Labor Committee, House Government Operations Committee, Administrative Rules Review Committee, and the Occupational and Professional Licensure Review Committee.

Thurston has also sponsored several legislations including the Utah Health Workforce Act, Intergenerational Poverty Solution, Telephone Solicitation Amendments, Mental Health Professional Licensing Amendments, and Vehicle License Plate and Registration Amendments.

In addition to his political career, Thurston has held various positions supporting the State of Utah’s efforts to create state-based solutions for local health care issues, and fighting to prevent the implementation of Obamacare in our state. He has helped lead the effort to reform Utah’s health care system, serving as Health Reform Coordinator for much of that time. He was actively involved in Utah’s effort to modernize our Medicaid system.

In November 2019, Thurston left state employment to become the Executive Director of the National Association of Health Data Organizations. This is a small non-profit membership organization that supports the use of data to inform health care systems and policy across the country.
