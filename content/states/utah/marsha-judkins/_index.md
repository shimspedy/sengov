Marsha Judkins is an American politician serving in the Utah House of Representatives, representing District 61. She assumed office in July 2018, succeeding Keith Grover. She is a member of the Republican Party.

Marsha Judkins graduated from Bingham High School in South Jordan. She then moved to Provo to begin college at Brigham Young University (BYU) on an academic scholarship. Marsha changed her major three times—Mathematics, Piano Pedagogy, Math again—, married a fellow student, had five of their seven children, and moved to their current home west of the freeway in Provo before graduating with a B.A. in Political Science with a minor in Mathematics ten years after she started.

When her youngest child was 10, Marsha went back to BYU and earned a Masters in Public Administration. After graduating, she worked as a Children’s Librarian at the Provo City Library, and then began teaching math at a private college in Salt Lake City. Marsha currently teaches part-time in the Developmental Math Department at Utah Valley University and loves her job.

In 2012, Marsha ran for a seat on the Provo City School Board. She loved her time on the Board, but decided not to run again at the end of her term. In June 2018, Keith Grover was appointed to fill a vacancy in the Utah Senate. This created a vacancy in the House. In July 2018, Judkins was appointed to fill out the rest of the term. She had already secured the party's nomination to run for the seat in the November 2018 general election by winning the primary with 60% of the vote.

In the November 2018 general election, Judkins defeated Eric Chase of the United Utah Party with 78.72 percent of the popular vote. In the November 2022 general election, Judkins defeated opponent Michael Anderson with 76.21% of the popular vote.

During the 2022 General Session, she served on the Social Services Appropriations Committee, House Health and Human Services Committee, and the House Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Committee. She co-sponsored HB 11, which banned transgender school-aged girls from participating in school sports. The bill was vetoed by Governor Cox before being overridden by the legislature.

Representative Judkins ran HB 113 which requires the State Board of Education to annually review standards and guidelines related to establishing disability classifications, permits disability program money to be used for facilities construction and alteration under certain circumstances, and amends a formula related to add-on weighted pupil units for students with disabilities.

Judkins ran HB 138 which modifies the age that a minor housed in a detention facility awaiting trial is transferred to an adult jail, and requires a minor who is committed to prison by a district court be provisionally housed with the Division of Juvenile Justice Services until the minor is 25 years old.
