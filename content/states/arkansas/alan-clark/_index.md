Senator Clark was chair of the Water Provider Legislative Task Force, which assessed the fiscal and infrastructure needs of water systems across Arkansas. He also is an advocate of reform in the child welfare system, and has chaired the Child Maltreatment Investigations Oversight Committee, which was created by legislation he sponsored in 2017.

Senator Clark has a passion for education and has sponsored pioneering legislation to promote literacy and to ensure that Arkansas children learn to read. He believes Arkansas educators are second to none, should be fairly compensated and that Arkansas should accept nothing less than being first in education.

He was the Senate co-sponsor of House bills that allow jurors to donate their per diem to charitable organizations. Other bills strengthened penalties for offenses committed against critical infrastructure, amended procedures in disputed child custody cases and reformed election laws.

He served on the Garland County Quorum Court from 1992 through 1996.  Senator Clark is a past member of the Garland County Planning Commission.

Senator Clark is vice president and chief operating officer of Clark’s Building and Decorating Center.  In 2011, Senator Clark was named Associate of the Year by the Hot Springs Home Builders Association.
