Rep. Brandon Achor is serving his first term in the Arkansas House. He represents District 71 which includes the city of Maumelle and the surrounding north-central area of Pulaski County.
For the 94th General Assembly, Rep. Achor serves on the House Public Transportation Committee and the House Agriculture, Forestry, and Economic Development Committee.
Rep. Achor was born and raised in Maumelle. Following graduation from Arkansas Baptist High School, Brandon attended the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville to study Biochemistry and spent a semester abroad in Dublin, Ireland where he would discover his passion for pharmacy.
Rep. Achor and his wife, Kaley, now co-own several independent community pharmacies across central and rural eastern Arkansas. To date, they have helped to establish and continue the unique access to locally-owned pharmacy care in 13 communities.
He and Kaley attend Central Hope Church in Little Rock and spend most of their free time trying to keep up with their beautiful toddler daughter Savvy and her mini-Aussie Gus.
