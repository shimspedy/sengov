Matt Stone is an American politician and a member of the Republican party. He serves as a representative for the 2nd district of the Arkansas Senate.

Stone's journey in politics began with his education. He attended the University of Arkansas at Monticello and the University of Arkansas, where he laid the foundation for his political career.

In May 2022, Stone's political career took a significant turn. He ran in the Republican primary election for the 2nd district of the Arkansas Senate, where he faced off against Beth Callaway and James McMenis.

Following his success in the primary, Stone went on to compete in the general election in November 2022. His opponent was Garry Smith, but Stone once again proved successful. He won the election with a significant majority, securing 67 percent of the votes.

After his victory, Stone assumed office in January 2023. Since then, he has been serving as a member of the Arkansas Senate from the 2nd district.

In addition to his political career, Stone has also been involved in various community services.

He also holds a BA in Mine Management and Safety from Midway University of Midway Kentucky and an MS in Operations Management from the University of Arkansas. Furthermore, Stone has a Master of Theology (Th.M.), a Doctorate of Theology (Th.D.) from Missionary Baptist Seminary in Little Rock, and a Graduate Certificate of Conflict Mediation from UALR.

Outside of his political career, Stone is a successful businessman. He founded Stone Timber Company Inc. and currently serves as the president of the company.
