Senator Stubblefield served for two years in the House of Representatives, then was elected to the Senate in November of 2012. He was sworn in as a state senator on the first day of the 2013 regular session.

Senator Stubblefield has sponsored legislation to rights of the unborn and the elderly. He believes in protecting the rights of farmers and livestock growers, and in protecting the rights guaranteed to American citizens under the Second Amendment. He supports legislation to lower taxes, reduce the size of government and simplify the regulatory burden on Arkansas businesses and residents.

During the 2019 session he co-sponsored Act 506 to create a farm to school and farm to pre-school program, to improve nutritional offerings for children.  Senator Stubblefield also sponsored Act 700, to provide that only physicians with a degree in OB-GYN may perform abortions.

While attending the University of Arkansas, Stubblefield enjoyed a successful career as a member of the Arkansas Razorback football team despite beginning as a walk-on from a high school which did not offer football. He has often said he is surprised by the similarities between playing tackle football for the Razorbacks and serving in the Arkansas legislature.

A life-long dairy farmer from Branch, he and his wife Kathi reared two children and taught them the value of keeping one’s word, a hard day’s work and respecting the rights of others.  Senator Stubblefield is a member of the Baptist church.
