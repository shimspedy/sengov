Rep. Cindy Crawford is serving her third term in the Arkansas House of Representatives. She represents District 51 in Sebastian County. District 51 includes a section of Fort Smith and the surrounding areas in Barling and Fort Chaffee.

For the 94th General Assembly, Cindy serves on the House Judiciary Committee and serves as Vice-Chair of the House Judiciary Juvenile Justice and Child Support Subcommittee. She also serves the House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee, Arkansas Legislative Council, and the Joint Performance Committee.

Cindy is a native of the Greater Fort Smith Area. In 1990 she began volunteering at the Pregnancy Crisis Center, where she became the director.

In 1994 Cindy began Tree of Life Preventive Health Maintenance, Inc., a non-profit. Hannah House, a home for girls, opened in 1997, where Cindy was the CEO and sometimes house mom for 23 years. Cindy’s passion can be seen through the social services she helped create under Tree of Life, focusing on at-risk youth and the health disparities plaguing her community. These programs helped create smoke-free environments in public areas. In addition, they reached over ten thousand (10,000) youth in Arkansas and Oklahoma, educating them on the dangers of engaging in risky behaviors such as drug and tobacco use, sexual activity, and the importance of developing self-respect.

 In 2017 Cindy quit resisting the call to enter the political realm. She succeeded in running for State Representative in 2018, beginning her first term in 2019.

Cindy and Jerry have been married for 43 years; they have two sons, Nick and his wife Jenni, Miles, and two amazing grandkids, Jamie and Isaac - who call her “GrandC.”
