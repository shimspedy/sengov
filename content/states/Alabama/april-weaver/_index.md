April Weaver, born on April 13, 1971, is an American politician and nurse. She is currently serving as a member of the Alabama Senate from the 14th district.

Weaver's journey in politics began with her service in the Alabama House of Representatives for the 49th district, a position she held from 2010 to 2020. Following her tenure in the House, she was appointed by President Donald Trump as the regional director of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Region IV. This region includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

In addition to her political career, Weaver has an extensive background in healthcare administration, with over 25 years of experience in the field. Her educational qualifications include a certificate in nursing from Kaplan University, an associate degree in nursing from Shelton State Community College, a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from the University of Alabama, and a Master of Business Administration with a concentration in healthcare administration from Independence University. She also holds an executive certificate in energy policy planning from the University of Idaho.

On May 12, 2020, Weaver resigned from her position in the House to accept the role of regional director for HHS. Later, she announced her candidacy in the special election to replace Cam Ward in the Alabama Senate, who had resigned to become director of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles. Weaver won the Republican Primary with a significant majority, securing 82% of the vote. She then went on to defeat Virginia Teague Applebaum in the general election and assumed office on July 14, 2021.

Weaver is married to Dr. Darrel Weaver, and they have four children. They are members of the Pelham First Baptist Church.
