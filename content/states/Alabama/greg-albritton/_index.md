Greg Albritton, born on March 18, 1952, is an American politician who has been serving in the Alabama Senate from the 22nd district since 2014. He was born and raised near Atmore, Alabama. He married Deborah Whitlock in 1974, and they have six children.

Albritton earned a degree in Business Administration from Weber State University in 1981. In 1995, he graduated from Thomas B. Goode School of Law and has managed an independent law practice since then. His professional experience includes working in finance, working for the General Electric Credit Corporation, and practicing law.

Before his tenure in the Senate, he served in the Alabama House of Representatives from the 64th district from 2002 to 2006. In May 2019, he voted to make abortion a crime at any stage in a pregnancy, with no exemptions for cases of rape or incest.

In November 2023, Albritton announced his candidacy to represent Alabama's 2nd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. He is running as a Republican in the March 5, 2024, primary election.

His passion for serving continued as he decided to run for public office and serve Alabama. He was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 2002, where he served as a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility. In 2014, Greg was first elected to the Alabama State Senate, winning with a decisive 67% of the vote.

His current term in the Alabama State Senate ends on November 4, 2026. Albritton's committee assignments over the years have included the Children, Youth, and Human Services Committee, Finance and Taxation Education Committee, Finance and Taxation General Fund Committee, Governmental Affairs Committee, Senate Judiciary Committee, Baldwin County Legislation Committee, Finances and Budget Committee, and Judicial System Study Commission.
