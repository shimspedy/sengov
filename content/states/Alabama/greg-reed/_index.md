Greg Reed, born on June 5, 1965, is an American politician who serves as a Republican member of the Alabama Senate. He represents the 5th District since 2010. He defeated Democrat Brett Wadsworth in the 2010 midterm elections to replace Charles Bishop in the 5th District. As of 2021, he is the Senate's president pro tempore.

In 2010, first-time candidate Greg Reed was elected to the Alabama Senate. In 2014, he was re-elected, without opposition, by the voters of Senate District 5. At the start of the new legislative term in 2015, his Republican colleagues elected him Majority Leader of the Alabama Senate and continued to serve until 2021. At the convening of the 2021 Regular Legislative Session, the Alabama Senate unanimously elected Senator Greg J. Reed to serve as the new President Pro Tempore of the Alabama State Senate.

During his tenure, he sponsored and passed Medicaid reform legislation that created Regional Care Organizations (RCOs). RCOs are self-sustaining managed care organizations that receive a capitated amount from Alabama Medicaid each year to provide services to Medicaid recipients within the RCO's geographical area. During the 2015 legislative session, Reed continued his Medicaid spearheaded legislation to create Integrated Care Networks (ICNs). The legislation allows ICNs to contract with Medicaid to provide long-term care under a capitated system. Alabama Medicaid estimates it will save taxpayers $1.5 billion over the first ten years.

In May 2019, he voted to make abortion a crime at any stage in a pregnancy, with no exemptions for cases of rape or incest.

Reed graduated from Walker County public schools, and attended Walker Community College. He later earned a bachelorâ€™s degree at the University of Alabama.

Greg Reed was born in Jasper, Alabama, and spent his childhood in south Walker County. He married Mitsy Harbison in 1988. Together they have three sons, Andrew, James, and John Michael. Senator Reed and his wife are members of the First Baptist Church of Jasper.
