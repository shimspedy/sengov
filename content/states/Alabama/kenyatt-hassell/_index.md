Kenyatté Hassell is a member of the Alabama House of Representatives, representing District 78. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Hassell assumed office on September 8, 2021, and his current term ends on November 4, 2026.

Hassell was born in Montgomery, Alabama. His career experience includes working as the urban director of YoungLife of Montgomery, the manager of Heritage Barbershop, and the campaign manager and a strategist for Alabama state legislator Kirk Hatcher.

In terms of his legislative work, Hassell has been assigned to various committees. For the 2023-2024 term, he was assigned to the Constitution, Campaigns and Elections Committee and the Military and Veterans' Affairs Committee. In the 2021-2022 term, he was assigned to the Agriculture, Livestock, and Water Committee and the Transportation and Local Government Committee.

Hassell ran for re-election to the Alabama House of Representatives to represent District 78 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. He was first elected in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by then-representative Kirk Hatcher's elevation to the State Senate.

In April 2023, Hassell sponsored House Bill 360 to remove Robert E. Lee’s birthday as a state holiday. However, the bill died in committee.
