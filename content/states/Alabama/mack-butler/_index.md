Mack Butler was born on April 27, 1963, in Birmingham, Alabama. He grew up in Gadsden, Alabama, and graduated from the Gadsden State Community College.

Butler began his business career at age 11 as a “paper boy” for the Gadsden Times. He and his wife founded and run Butler Electrical Contractors and Butler Properties.

He served two terms in the State House of Representatives as well as ten years on the Etowah County School Board. He is known for his political commentary on his personal Facebook page, where he has called supporters of abortion, along with all members of the democratic party "pure evil" and "guilty of murder by association". On numerous occasions Butler has stated he wants to see an end to abortion protections, such as Roe v. Wade.

Butler is an electrician and property investor. He was elected as a Republican member of the Alabama House of Representatives on December 11, 2012. He represents District 28, which includes parts of Etowah County and St. Clair County.

Etowah County is located in the northeastern part of Alabama and is one of the most densely populated counties in the state. Its county seat is Gadsden, which is also the largest city in the county. St. Clair County was established on November 20, 1818. A portion of St. Clair County was used to create Etowah County in 1866.

In 2017, he sponsored a bill for the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act to make it harder to remove Confederate monuments in Alabama. He argued, "What happened in America was horrible, and it’s important we learn how horrible it was." The bill passed the house in May 2017.

Butler ran for election for the Alabama Senate District 10. He was defeated by Andrew Jones in the primary.

With his wife Connie, he has four children. He is a Baptist.
