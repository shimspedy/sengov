Chad Robertson is a member of the Alabama House of Representatives, representing District 40. He is a member of the Republican Party. He assumed office on November 9, 2022, and his current term ends on November 4, 2026.

Before his political career, Chad Robertson served in the U.S. Navy. His career experience includes co-owning Heflin Fitness and Lineville Fitness. He has also served as the executive director of the Cleburne Chamber of Commerce.

Robertson ran for election to the Alabama House of Representatives to represent District 40. He won in the general election on November 8, 2022. In the election, Chad Robertson defeated Pam Howard, securing a victory with 82.8% of the vote.

In the Republican primary runoff for Alabama House of Representatives District 40, Chad Robertson defeated Julie Borrelli on June 21, 2022, with 50.2% of the vote.

Robertson was appointed to three House committees: Military and Veterans Affairs; Constitution, Campaigns and Elections; and the Economic Development and Tourism. All three committees align closely with his legislative priorities, as well as his personal and professional experience.

Robertson's base salary as a legislator is $53,913/year. No per diem is paid to legislators whose permanent residence is less than six hours away. Legislators who are 6-12 hrs from their permanent residence receive $12.75/day. Legislators who are over 12 hours away with no overnight receive $34/day.

Robertson's legislative priorities are likely to become more concrete after spending more time with his new colleagues in the Alabama House. His first instincts are to help expand the stateâ€™s Veteran Treatment Courts program, as well as to strategically encourage economic development.
