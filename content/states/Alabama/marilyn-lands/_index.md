Marilyn Lands is an American politician who currently serves as a Democratic member of the Alabama House of Representatives, representing District 10 in Huntsville. She was elected in a March 2024 special election to succeed Republican David Cole, who resigned after being jailed for electoral fraud.

Marilyn Lands moved to Huntsville, Alabama, when she was two years old. Her career experience includes working as a licensed professional counselor. Lands previously worked in the banking and aerospace industries. She holds a Master of Science degree in Counseling Psychology from Alabama A&M University, as well as a Master of Science degree in Management and a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. She is also a graduate of the Center for Action and Contemplation “Living School” and Leadership Huntsville/Madison County.

Professionally, Lands works as a Licensed Professional Counselor in a private practice and as a Supervising Counselor to help aspiring clinicians meet their requirements for state licensure. Before entering private practice, she worked for over a decade in community mental health and provided individual, family, and group counseling for patients. Over the years, she has also worked in the banking and aerospace industries.

Lands based her campaign on reproductive rights, opposing Alabama's ban on abortion, as well as supporting in vitro fertilization (IVF) in the aftermath of LePage v. Center for Reproductive Medicine. She was endorsed by Planned Parenthood in the election. The race drew national interest against the backdrop of the controversial Alabama State Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are considered children under state law.

Marilyn Lands is a person of deep personal faith and is the author of "A Day of Rest: A Primer on Keeping the Sabbath." She is a member of the Episcopal Church of the Nativity and serves on the Commission for Spirituality in the diocese of Alabama. She continues to work as a frequent lecturer and conducts workshops on parenting, balanced living, stress management, sabbath keeping, mindfulness meditation, and coping with grief.

In her personal life, Lands is a wife and mother, and she has been an active member of her community for over thirty years. She has served as past festival chair of Panoply of the Arts and a past board chair of The Arts Council and Leadership Huntsville/Madison County. She is dedicated to improving access to affordable healthcare, mental health services, and women's reproductive care in her district.

Marilyn Lands' election to the Alabama House of Representatives marked a significant shift in the political landscape of District 10, as she won with over 62 percent of the vote, replacing a Republican incumbent. Her victory was seen as a testament to her commitment to addressing the needs and concerns of her constituents, particularly women, and her ability to bring about positive change in her community.
