Clyde Lee Chambliss Jr., born on April 16, 1969, is an American Republican politician who has been serving in the Alabama Senate from the 30th district since 2014. He was born in Prattville, Alabama, U.S. and is a member of the Republican party. He is married to Tara Herring.

Chambliss completed his degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Alabama in 1992. After his graduation, he started his civil engineering firm. He has resided, worked, and raised a family in Alabama Senate District 30.

In 1996, Chambliss was elected to his first of three terms on the Autauga County Commission. He served as the body’s chairman from 2000-2008. As an employee of Central Alabama Electric Cooperative, Chambliss was instrumental in forging a partnership between Central Alabama Electric Cooperative, Autauga County, the City of Prattville, the Autauga County Industrial Development Board, Marshall Construction and the Chamber of Commerce for the creation of the Interstate Business Park.

Chambliss has completed Leadership Autauga, Leadership Alabama and Leadership Elmore. He has sat on numerous regional boards including: Central Alabama Aging Consortium, Central Alabama Regional Planning Commission, and the Montgomery Metropolitan Planning Organization.

Chambliss and his wife Tara are the proud parents of three daughters: Kristen, Lauren, and Madison. Chambliss is the Principle Engineer for Chambliss Engineering (CE), which provides civil engineering services to local governments, developers, and water systems primarily in Elmore and Autauga Counties.

In the midst of his civic and business responsibilities, Chambliss has also served in leadership roles in the church. He has taught Sunday School, served on the Building Committee, and has served three terms as a deacon at Heritage Baptist Church in Prattville.

Chambliss was elected to the Alabama State Senate in November of 2014 and currently serves on the following committees: Confirmations (Chairman), Children, Youth and Human Services, Finance and Taxation General Fund, Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Development, Governmental Affairs, and Local Legislation. Alabama Senate District 30 includes all or parts of Autauga, Chilton, Coosa, Elmore, and Tallapoosa counties.

In May 2019, he sponsored the Human Life Protection Act, which bans all abortions except in the case of endangerment to the mother’s health. Abortions in the cases of rape and incest are banned under the statute, which subjects those who perform abortions to a prison sentence of 10 to 99 years. When asked about the issue, Chambliss said: "When God creates the miracle of life inside a woman’s womb, it is not our place as human beings to extinguish that life." The legislation only applied to zygotes or fertilized eggs that are inside the womb, not those used in fertility treatments. Chambliss explained the discrepancy, "The egg in the lab doesn’t apply. It’s not in a woman. She’s not pregnant."
