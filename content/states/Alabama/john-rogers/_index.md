John Westley Rogers Jr. was born on December 16, 1940, in Birmingham, Alabama. He is an American politician from the state of Alabama and a member of the Democratic Party. Rogers serves in the Alabama House of Representatives, representing the 52nd district.

Rogers has a bachelor's degree from Tennessee State University, a master's degree from the University of Alabama, and an associate's degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. His professional experience includes serving as president and photographer for Rogers and Rogers Inc. He has also served as the director of Minority Affairs, a public relations counselor, and as an administrator at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.

In 1988, he joined an effort to remove the Confederate flag from the Alabama Capitol building. Rogers personally opposes abortion but represents a pro-choice district and votes accordingly.

On May 1, 2019, Rogers stated during a filibuster in opposition to a bill challenging Roe v. Wade, that would make performing or attempting to perform an abortion in Alabama a felony. His comments were widely decried in the media, by conservative pundits, and by the Alabama House Democratic Caucus. Senator Doug Jones, a friend of Rogers', called him to let him know that the comments were hurtful and that he would condemn them publicly. Rogers later apologized for using the word "retarded" in his criticism.

In September 2023, Rogers was indicted on two counts of obstruction of justice related to an investigation of the defrauding of the Jefferson County Community Service Fund. The same investigation previously led to the indictment and resignation of fellow state representative Fred Plump. Rogers denied any wrongdoing and said that he would "look forward to a court date".

Rogers is Catholic. He assumed office in 1982 and his current term ends on November 4, 2026.
