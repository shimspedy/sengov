Napoleon Bracy Jr. is a member of the Democratic Party and a representative of the Alabama House of Representatives, representing District 98. He assumed office on November 3, 2010, and his current term ends on November 4, 2026.

Born in 1976 or 1977, Bracy received his undergraduate degree from Dillard University. His professional experience includes working for the defense contractor Austal USA and serving on the Prichard City Council, where he served as council president. He was elected as chairman of the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus in 2013 and has been a member of Alpha Phi Alpha.

In addition to his legislative duties, Bracy currently serves as co-chairman of the Mobile County Legislative Delegation. He graduated from Blount High School in 1995 and Dillard University of New Orleans.

Bracy is running for election to the U.S. House to represent Alabama's 2nd Congressional District. He is on the ballot in the Democratic primary on March 5, 2024. The primary is taking place in the context of court-ordered redistricting. In October 2023, a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama approved a new congressional district map for Alabama after federal courts found two previous redistricting efforts violated the Voting Rights Act. The October 2023 map redrew the 2nd District to have a 48.7% Black voting-age population, which political commentators say will tilt it towards Democrats.

Bracy says he feels fortunate to survive growing up in an impoverished community and that he owes it to others growing up in similar conditions to make their lives easier.
