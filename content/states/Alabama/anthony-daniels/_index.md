Anthony Daniels, born on October 5, 1982, is an American politician and a prominent member of the Alabama House of Representatives. He has been representing House District 53 since 2014.

Daniels made history when he assumed office as the Minority Leader of the Alabama House of Representatives on February 22, 2017. At the age of 34, he became both the youngest and the first black person to hold this position in modern state history. His leadership has been instrumental in leading the House Democratic Caucus.

Before his political career, Daniels was an elementary school teacher, a profession he chose due to his passion for education. He holds both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree from Alabama A&M University.

In November 2023, Daniels announced his candidacy to represent Alabama's 2nd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. He is running as a Democrat in the primary election scheduled for March 5, 2024.

Daniels was born in Bartow, Florida, and grew up in Midway, Alabama. He was raised by his grandparents who instilled in him a strong foundation of faith. At the age of 23, he became the first black man elected chairman of the National Education Association Student Program, an extension of the National Education Association that provides support to college students seeking a career in public education.

As the leader of the student program, Daniels worked out of the NEA headquarters in the nation’s capital, meeting with congressional leaders and organizations to find a solution to make college more affordable. He was instrumental in the passing of the College Cost and Reduction Act of 2007.

Once he became an elementary school teacher in Huntsville, Alabama, he realized he could have a deeper influence working in government. He believes that as a policy maker, he can impact the lives of the young and people in general, those who don’t have a voice for themselves.
