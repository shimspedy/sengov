Barbara Boyd represents District 32 in the Alabama House of Representatives. The major areas within Calhoun County that she represents include most of Anniston, Hobson City, and parts of Oxford.

Barbara Boyd was born on January 31, 1937. She received her B.A. Degree in French and English from Miles College in Birmingham, her M.A. in Supervision and Curriculum Development from the University of Alabama, and her Ed.D. in Instructional Leadership and Reading from the University of Alabama. She was elected as a representative in 1994.

Boyd's career in politics began with her work on President Jimmy Carter's campaign. This marked the start of her political journey as a Democrat. In 1983, she made history by becoming the first African American elected to the Cleveland Heights City Council, where she would ultimately serve as mayor. This was a significant milestone in her career, launching her into the political spotlight.

In addition to her political career, Boyd also worked with the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, as well as with the Children's Defense Fund. These roles allowed her to make a significant impact in her community and state.

Boyd was originally elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1992, and would be reelected three times after before term limits forced her into retirement. In 2001, she was succeeded by Claudette Woodard. In 2006, Boyd was again eligible to run for her former House seat after sitting out for four years. She did so, and won with 83.66% of the vote. She won a second term in 2008 with 87.55% of the vote. With Democrats retaking control of the House, Boyd would serve as Chairperson of the Health Committee for the 128th Ohio General Assembly. Boyd was reelected to a third term in 2010 with 86% of the vote. She also served on the committee of Veteran's Affairs. Boyd faced primary opposition in 2012 for her eighth term, but defeated challenger Howard Harris, securing 91.80% of the vote. She was unopposed in the general election. She was term-limited in 2014 and succeeded by her daughter, Janine Boyd.

Boyd passed away on November 5, 2022, at the age of 80, leaving behind a legacy of service and dedication to her community.
