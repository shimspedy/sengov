Ivan "Van" Smith is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from the 42nd district since November 6, 2019. He succeeded Jimmy Martin in this role.

Born in Chilton County, Alabama, Smith has a strong educational background. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Agriscience from Auburn University and a Master of Science in Agriscience from Alabama A&M University. He also holds a teaching certificate in administrative education from the University of Montevallo.

Before entering politics, Smith dedicated 30 years of his life to education. He worked as an educator for 13 years and spent another 17 years as the principal of Billingsley High School. His commitment to education has had a profound impact on his community.

In addition to his work in education, Smith has been a cattle farmer since 2013. His farming operations include a commercial cow/calf herd, feeder cattle, hay, and timber. This experience has given him a deep understanding of the agricultural industry, which is vital to many of his constituents in the 42nd district.

Smith's election to the Alabama House of Representatives in November 2019 was a significant milestone in his career. As a representative, he has the opportunity to make a direct impact on the laws and policies that affect his district and the state of Alabama as a whole.
