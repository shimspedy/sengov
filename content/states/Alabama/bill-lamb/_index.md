Bill Lamb is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives since November 8, 2022. He represents Alabama's 62nd House district.

Lamb was elected on November 8, 2022, in the 2022 Alabama House of Representatives election against his Democratic opponent, Brenda Cephus. He assumed office the very next day on November 9, 2022.

Before his political career, Lamb graduated from the University of Alabama. He then worked as the chief financial officer of Tuscaloosa County, Alabama for 39 years and retired from that position in 2021. During his tenure, he turned a $1.5 million budget deficit into a healthy reserve with no long-term debt.

Lamb is a lifelong resident of Tuscaloosa and a member of the Republican Party. His current term in the Alabama House of Representatives is set to end on November 4, 2026.
