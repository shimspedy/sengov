Will Barfoot is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He represents the 25th district in the Alabama State Senate.

Born and raised in Pike Road, Alabama, Barfoot pursued his higher education at Auburn University at Montgomery. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Studies in 1995. Following his undergraduate studies, Barfoot attended Jones School of Law in Montgomery, where he received his Juris Doctorate in 2001.

In addition to his political career, Barfoot is also a practicing attorney. He co-founded Barfoot & Schoettker, a personal injury law firm based in Montgomery, Alabama.

Barfoot's political career began when he served as a temporary probate judge in Montgomery County, Alabama in 2005. In 2006, he challenged incumbent Larry Dixon in the Republican primary for nomination for the District 25 seat in the Alabama State Senate. Despite losing with 32.60% of the vote to Dixon's 58.43%, Barfoot remained active in politics.

He was elected to serve as a delegate for Mike Huckabee at the 2008 Republican National Convention. In 2018, Barfoot ran again for the District 25 seat, this time to replace Dick Brewbaker, who had decided not to seek re-election. He defeated Ronda Walker in the Republican primary with 64.0% of the vote, and defeated David Sadler in the general election with 61.3% of the vote.

As a member of the Alabama State Senate, Barfoot has served on several Senate committees, including Judiciary (as Vice Chairperson), Confirmations, Banking and Insurance, Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Development, Children Youth and Human Services, and Veterans and Military Affairs.

In the 2022 general election, Barfoot successfully defended his seat, defeating Louie Woolbright with 85.3% of the vote.
