Tim Wadsworth is a member of the Alabama House of Representatives, representing District 14. He assumed office on November 5, 2014, and his current term ends on November 4, 2026. Wadsworth ran for re-election to the Alabama House of Representatives to represent District 14 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Wadsworth received his B.S. in accounting and M.Acc. from the University of Alabama. He also received his J.D. from the Cumberland School of Law at Samford University. His professional experience includes serving as a certified public accountant and practicing tax law. He has been a member of the National Rifle Association.

Wadsworth has been assigned to various committees throughout his tenure. These include the Children and Senior Advocacy Committee, Jefferson County Legislation Committee, House Judiciary Committee (where he served as Vice Chair), and House Local Legislation Committee.

Wadsworth is noted by the American Conservative Union as one of the consistent top conservative representatives in Montgomery. He was also one of the first state officials to endorse and support Donald Trump for President in 2016. Wadsworth served as a delegate committed to Donald Trump to the Republican National Convention in 2016 and in 2020 and was elected as Elector by the Fourth Congressional District to cast your vote for Donald Trump.

Wadsworth has worked hard to bring new jobs and businesses to the communities in Walker and Winston counties. He has been successful in bringing back their share of tax dollars. He was able to secure grants for the communities and schools in his district. Specifically, he negotiated to get lighting at the Carbon Hill - Nauvoo exit on I-22. Similarly, he worked to have the State of Alabama take over Duncan Bridge on Smith Lake, and spend $5.7 million of state funds for its badly needed renovation.

Wadsworth established the Cordova Women’s Society and Carbon Hill Women’s Club, and a community college campus in Winston County. He attended Walker College and the University of Alabama where he earned his Bachelor’s degree in accounting and Masters in Tax Accounting from the University of Alabama. He went on to work in the tax department of Deloitte, Haskins, and Sells LLP, earning a CPA and in the tax department at Southern Natural Gas before earning his law degree at Cumberland School of Law in 1985.
