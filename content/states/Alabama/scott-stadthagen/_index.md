Scott Stadthagen is an American politician serving as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives for the 9th district. He is a member of the Republican Party. In November of 2022, Stadthagen's Republican colleagues elected him Majority Leader of the Alabama State House.

Born Gregory Scott Stadthagen Jr. on August 9, 1977, he graduated from the University of West Alabama with a B.S. in 2002. After graduation, he started his business, Hagen Homes Incorporated, in 2005. He worked as the owner of Hagen Homes until 2018, when he announced his run for Alabama House of Representatives.

Stadthagen holds many local leadership positions in Hartselle, his current place of residence, including Chair of the Hartselle Area Chamber Commerce, member of the Economic Development group of Hartselle, member of the Morgan County Builders Association, member of the Hartselle Rotary, member of the Hartselle Kiwanis, and member of the Leadership of Hartselle Association.

In the 2018 Republican Primary for Alabama House District 9, Stadthagen won with 62.4% of the vote before running unopposed in the General Election. During his political career, Stadthagen has sponsored numerous bills targeting LGBT people as part of the larger 2020s anti-LGBT movement. In February 2022, he introduced House Bill 322, a bathroom bill targeting transgender students. The bill was later amended by the Alabama Senate to include a restriction of classroom discussion or instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten through fifth grade, drawing comparisons to Florida's Don't Say Gay bill.

In April 2023, Stadthagen was one of six Republicans who introduced House Bill 401, which looked to ban drag performances in public spaces where minors were present by amending the Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act to expand the definition of "sexual conduct" to include drag. The proposal did not make it into law.

In October 2023, Stadthagen was honored by the American Legislative Exchange Council as one of the top "50 under 50" legislators who represented the conservative think tank's principles and values.
