Jack Williams is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 34 in the Alabama State Senate. He assumed office on November 7, 2018, and his current term ends on November 4, 2026. Prior to his tenure in the Senate, Williams served in the Alabama House of Representatives for District 102.

Born in Mobile County in 1955, Williams has lived his entire life in District 34. He is a graduate of Mary G. Montgomery High School. Alongside his political career, Williams is a businessman and publisher. He owns and operates the J Bar W farm and Twin Oaks Nursery. He has been married to his wife, Bobbie, for over 40 years. Together, they raise cattle, timber, and hay on their farm.

Throughout his political career, Williams has been assigned to several committees. In the 2023-2024 term, he served on the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee, the Banking and Insurance Committee (as Vice Chair), the Children, Youth, and Human Services Committee, the Confirmations Committee, the Healthcare Committee, the Local Legislation Mobile County Committee, the Transportation and Energy Committee, and the Reapportionment Committee.

Williams ran for re-election to the Alabama State Senate to represent District 34 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. His dedication to conservative values and his commitment to southwest Alabama have earned him a reputation as a strong defender of whatâ€™s best for his district.
