I'm the son of a Vietnam-era Air Force veteran. After returning from Vietnam in 1970, my father was stationed at Elmendorf AFB. My family fell in love with Alaska and after my father's military retirement, all eight of us moved from Anchorage to Northway, Alaska in 1978, when I was in the 4th grade.

In Northway, I grew up absorbing the traditional rural lifestyle. This is where I developed my love and respect for people and the land. I learned to be patient and listen, live conservatively, and work together toward self-sufficiency by hunting, fishing, trapping, gardening, food preservation, and utilizing natural resources like timber for home heating.

I attended Walter Northway School and graduated as the Valedictorian of my class in 1987. An opportunity for a scholarship to play basketball and get my education at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks presented itself, and I took it. I graduated in 1992 and returned home to Walter Northway School with my teaching degree in hand, becoming a Kindergarten/1st grade classroom teacher. After 14 years in Northway, I accepted a middle school job teaching math and science in Tok, AK and retired in 2017 after 25 years of teaching.

I'm the very proud father of four amazing daughters, who are Upper Tanana Athabascans and Doyon shareholders. My girls all hold a love for hunting, fishing, trapping, their elders, and their Native culture. I have been blessed to have gained four son-in-laws and four beautiful grandchildren.

I know from playing/coaching/refereeing basketball, contributing to teacher work groups, and serving on a governance body, better results come from communication and collaboration with others. For 25 years I served on the Upper Tanana/40 Mile Advisory Committee, and with my peers created hunting, fishing, and trapping regulations to best balance the ecology of our region. I served as a teacher advisor to the Alaska Gateway School District Regional School Board for about five years and after retirement was publicly elected to serve as a board member in November of 2018. These experiences continue to reaffirm the value of teamwork because in the end, we are all on Team Alaska.

I have lived in Alaska for 54 years, 46 in the Upper Tanana area, I've travelled to many of our rural towns across District R and have met, and became friends with many people. Through these travels, I have a first-hand knowledge of the diversity and the differing needs of the people and communities of District R. Having travelled to countries as diverse as Czechoslovakia, Namibia, Mexico, and Canada as well as many of our lower 48 states, I was able to "look" outside of Alaska and gain experience that allows me to understand the role Alaska currently plays in the world and in the future.

Some of you may recognize my name from the Route 91 Las Vegas shooting on Oct. 1, 2017. It was a tragic, life-changing crisis that helped me see that people are not as divided as it seems. During and after the horrific event, I witnessed people from all beliefs and cultures uniting in a time of need. We have a crisis right now here in Alaska: a budget crisis. I believe all Alaskans can come together and make those conservative, fiscally responsible decisions that are required for a successful future.

I've been a proud, life-time Republican because my values closely align with our Republican Party views. I realize there are many issues of importance to District R and all of Alaska, and I am excited for the opportunity to be the Senator for District R and believe I have the knowledge, experience and skillsets needed to serve our people.

Previously, I served as the State House Representative for District 36. I have a part of Republican-led majority and minority caucuses who fought for the PFD, fiscally responsible budgets, and to preserve your essential liberties and freedoms. I have immersed myself into as many committees as I could, and have served on the Finance, Resources, Education, Transportation, and Tribal Affairs Committees. It has been an incredible learning experience and an honor serving the people of District R and Alaska.

As we return for the 34th Alaska Legislature, my promise to you is that I will represent you with honor and integrity and will ALWAYS fight for the people, first and foremost.
