Robert Yundt is an American politician who currently serves as a member of the Alaska Senate, representing District N. Born and raised in Wasilla, Alaska, Yundt has deep roots in the community he now represents. He graduated from Wasilla High School and went on to build a successful career in residential home construction and residential asset management. 

Yundt's political journey began in 2020 when he was elected to the Mat-Su Borough Assembly, representing the 4th district. During his tenure, he focused on economic development and community growth, earning the respect and support of his constituents. He was reelected in 2023 but resigned in September 2024 after moving out of the district. His resignation led to the appointment of Maxwell Sumner as his successor.

In 2024, Yundt decided to run for the Alaska Senate's District N seat. Despite facing a tough primary against the incumbent David S. Wilson, Yundt emerged victorious in the general election with over 53% of the vote. He assumed office on January 21, 2025, and his current term is set to end in January 2029.

Throughout his career, Yundt has been a staunch advocate for economic development, property rights, and community growth. He has also been actively involved in various service organizations, including serving as the past president of the Alaska State Homebuilder's Association and a past director for the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation. Additionally, Yundt has a passion for coaching youth wrestling and mentoring future leaders.

As a family man, Yundt is dedicated to his wife, Trenitie, and their six children: Aleah, Hallee, Robert III, Regan, Isla, and Kinzi. He is also an avid outdoorsman, enjoying the natural beauty and recreational opportunities that Alaska has to offer.

Yundt's commitment to his community and his dedication to public service have made him a respected figure in Alaskan politics. His focus on economic development, property rights, and community growth continues to drive his work in the Alaska Senate, where he strives to make a positive impact on the lives of his constituents.
