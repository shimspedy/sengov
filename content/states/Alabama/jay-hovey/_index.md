Jay Hovey is a member of the Alabama State Senate, representing District 27. He is a member of the Republican Party. He assumed office on November 9, 2022, and his current term ends on November 4, 2026.

Hovey ran for election to the Alabama State Senate to represent District 27 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. Prior to his political career, Hovey earned a B.S. from Auburn University in 2001. His career experience includes working as a mortgage loan originator with AuburnBank and CharterBank, a property manager and realtor with First Realty, and an account manager with ValleyCrest Companies.

Hovey was born and raised in South Lee County, Alabama. His father is an Opelika High School graduate and a third-generation small-business owner; his mother, a graduate of Auburn High School, went on to become a full-time educator. Raised in a small farmhouse in Marvyn with his two younger brothers, selflessness and service were fundamental principles of his life from an early age.

Jay worked as an Auburn University student firefighter in order to put himself through college. He is a proud Eagle Scout and formerly served the city of Auburn as a Councilman. He has a lifetime of service to his community, including roles with the Alabama Small Business Advisory Commission, United Way of Lee County, Kiwanis Club, the Auburn Chamber of Commerce, and the city of Auburn Greenspace Advisory Board.

Jay grew up in the Beauregard community's Providence Baptist Church where he met his wife Anna in the youth program. They were married seven years later by Dr. Rusty Sowell, the church's current senior pastor. Jay has the privilege of serving Providence as a deacon now, and Anna sings in the choir and teaches in the children's choir and Sunday school programs.
