Merika Coleman, born on September 6, 1973, is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Alabama Senate, representing the 19th district since 2022. Prior to this, she served in the Alabama House of Representatives, representing its 57th district from 2002 to 2022.

Coleman was born at RAF Lakenheath, England, UK. She received her education from the University of Alabama, Birmingham, earning a B.A. in mass communication in 1995 and a Master of Public Administration in 1997.

Before her political career, Coleman worked as a public policy analyst and strategist in nonprofits. She served as the Director of Community and Economic Development for Lawson State Community College, and later became Director of Economic and Community Development for the City of Bessemer, Alabama.

In 2002, Coleman was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives. In 2004, she was a Fleming Fellow with the Center for Policy Alternatives. In 2009, she ran for a State Senate seat in a special election. She placed second among the eight candidates in the primary, and advanced to the runoff election. She lost the runoff to Priscilla Dunn.

She won her 2010 House reelection campaign with 68% of the vote. Coleman cosponsored a bill criminalizing human trafficking in Alabama, which became law in 2010. At the time, Alabama was one of six states to not have a human trafficking law.

Coleman has also sponsored bills on parole reform and adding restrictions to Alabama's Stand Your Ground law. As of 2017, she was Chair of the Boards and Commissions Committee, and served on the Judiciary, Ways and Means General Fund, and Banking Committees. In February 2017, she became Assistant Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.

In addition to her political career, Coleman is also an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama.

In November 2023, Coleman announced her candidacy to represent Alabama's 2nd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. She is running as a Democrat in the March 5, 2024, primary election.
