Debbie Wood, born on May 25, 1965, is an American politician from Alabama. She is a Republican member of the Alabama House of Representatives from the 38th district, serving since 2018.

Born and raised in Valley, Alabama, Wood attended Beulah High School and Southern Union State Community College. She later completed a Bachelorâ€™s degree at Faulkner University.

Before her political career, Wood was a small businesswoman. Since 2000, she has been owning and operating Century 21 Wood Real Estate in Valley. She also served as the broker and Chief Operating Officer for Century 21 Wood Real Estate.

Wood's political career began when she ran against the chairman of the county commission in Chambers County in 2002. She was the first female elected to represent District 6. She would later become the first female to serve as the chairperson for the County Commission. She served 4 terms and ran for the House seat after the incumbent, Isaac Whorton, announced he was running for circuit judge.

Wood defeated fellow Republican Todd Rauch by 8 votes in the state's July primary runoff. She then defeated Democrat Brian McGee in the November 2018 general election. Her current term ends on November 4, 2026.

In addition to these positions, she served as president of Alabama Association County Commissioners. She is a member of Langdale United Methodist Church and is the mother of two young adult children, Nick and Katelyn, and two beautiful granddaughters Katherine and Lillian.
