Juandalynn Deleathia "Lee Lee" Givan is an American lawyer and politician. She serves as a Democratic member of the Alabama House of Representatives, where she represents Jefferson County. She was born as Juandalynn Deleathia Givan and is affiliated with the Democratic party. She received her education from Miles College where she earned her Bachelor of Arts (BA) and later pursued law from Miles Law School to earn her Juris Doctorate (JD).

Givan assumed office on November 3, 2010, and she has been serving the people of Alabama since then. She succeeded Earl Hilliard Jr. and has been an incumbent member of the Alabama House of Representatives from the 60th district. Her tenure has been marked by her strong stand on various social issues.

In a committee meeting in March 2017, Givan highlighted that African-Americans were more likely to get arrested for marijuana possession. She was accused of "playing the race card" by former Representative Richard Laird, and she asked him not to attend meetings anymore. In May 2017, she opposed the bill for the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act, which would make it harder to remove Confederate monuments in Alabama. She argued that such legislation continues to put Alabama in a negative light, which it is known for racism, discrimination.

On January 27, 2022, Givan asked for the resignation of Brookside's mayor, judge, and prosecutor. She stated that the police of Brookside have been stopping residents, harassing them, and giving exorbitant numbers in their fee structure in the city of Brookside. She commented on the racial profiling and harassment of women. Following this, she began to call for an investigation by Steve Marshall, noting that many outlets have already sent a request to him to take a greater role in this issue.

In November 2023, Givan announced her candidacy to represent Alabama's 2nd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. She is running as a Democrat in the March 5, 2024, primary election.

Givan is not just a politician but also a business owner and attorney. She owns the law firm Givan & Associates, which includes government relations and program management consulting services. She is also a mentor and public speaker. In 2010, she was named professional woman of the year by the NAACP.
