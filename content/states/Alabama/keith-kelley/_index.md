Keith Kelley is a member of the Alabama State Senate, representing District 12. He is a member of the Republican Party. He assumed office on November 9, 2022, and his current term ends on November 4, 2026.

Kelley was born in Anniston, Alabama. His career experience includes owning and working as the president of Harris-McKay Realty. He has served as the president of the Alabama Association of Realtors and on the National Association of Realtors board of directors.

Kelley ran for election to the Alabama State Senate to represent District 12. He won in the general election on November 8, 2022. In the general election for Alabama State Senate District 12, Kelley defeated Danny McCullars, securing 73.6% of the votes.

Before his tenure in the Alabama State Senate, Kelley started his first business at the age of 19. He has always felt the call of public service and the responsibility to make the world a better place. The foundational leadership skills he learned from the Jaycees and Future Farmers of America have been carried with him throughout his career.

As a senator, Kelley wants to ensure that District 12 continues to have a strong voice in Montgomery and is represented with honesty and integrity. He learned the importance of serving others at an early age and has a true desire for public service. As a job creator and political outsider, he aims to provide the leadership that Northeast Alabama needs to ensure that the area grows and thrives.
