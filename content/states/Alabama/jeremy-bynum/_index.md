Jeremy Bynum is an American engineer and politician who currently serves as a member of the Alaska House of Representatives for the 1st district. Born in Portland, Oregon, Bynum graduated from Portland State University with a Bachelor of Science in engineering. His career began in the United States Air Force, where he served from 1995 to 2000 as a power generation specialist. He continued his service in the Air National Guard from 2001 to 2003.

After his military service, Bynum worked as the electric manager of Ketchikan Public Utilities. His dedication to public service led him to run for a position on the Ketchikan Gateway Borough Assembly, where he was elected in 2020. During his tenure on the assembly, Bynum focused on improving local infrastructure and supporting community development projects.

In 2022, Bynum ran for the Alaska House of Representatives, challenging the incumbent Independent Dan Ortiz. Although he lost the general election, Bynum remained committed to his political aspirations. When Ortiz announced he would not seek re-election in 2024, Bynum ran for the seat again and won with 52% of the vote, defeating Independent candidates Grant EchoHawk and Agnes Moran.

Bynum assumed office on January 21, 2025, and serves as a member of the House Finance Committee. His legislative priorities include economic development, infrastructure improvement, and supporting veterans' services. Bynum's background in engineering and public utilities provides him with a unique perspective on the challenges facing his district and the state of Alaska.

Bynum has lived in Ketchikan, Alaska, with his wife, Carolyn Henry, since 2016. He is actively involved in various community organizations, including the American Legion, First City Rotary, and the Ketchikan Area Arts and Humanities Council. Bynum's commitment to public service and his community-driven approach make him a dedicated representative for the people of Alaska's 1st district.
