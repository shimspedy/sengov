Rolanda Hollis is an American politician who serves as a Democratic member of the Alabama House of Representatives for the 58th district. She assumed office on March 7, 2017, succeeding Oliver Robinson.

Born and raised in Birmingham, Hollis graduated from Huffman High School before earning her Bachelor of Science in Accounting from Tuskegee University. She has more than a decade of experience as a real estate broker, which has given her a deep understanding of the value of hard work.

In her political career, Hollis has been involved in several notable events and initiatives. In September 2019, she was arrested for misdemeanor domestic violence at the Inn on Destin Harbor in Destin, Florida. Responding police found "obvious signs of a disturbance, including broken glass", and a witness reported seeing Hollis shoving her husband, Aaron Jefferson, at approximately 11 PM. Hollis and her husband denied there was a physical altercation, although Hollis admitted to throwing a glass. Hollis was arrested and released the next day from Okaloosa County Jail after posting bail.

In 2020, Hollis introduced HB 238, a bill that would require all males to undergo sterilization by vasectomy after the birth of their third child or prior to their 50th birthday, whichever comes first. Men would be required to pay for the procedure themselves. Hollis claimed that her plan for forced sterilizations of men would â€œneutralize" the Alabama Human Life Protection Act, a bill restricting abortion which was made law in 2019.

Hollis was re-elected to the Alabama House of Representatives to represent District 58 in the general election on November 8, 2022. Her current term ends on November 4, 2026.
