Kenneth Paschal, born on December 9, 1966, is an American politician from the state of Alabama. He is a member of the Republican Party and was elected to represent District 73 in the Alabama House of Representatives in a special election held in July 2021. This election marked a significant milestone as Paschal became the first black Republican elected to the Alabama Legislature in almost 140 years, and the first to serve in the state legislature since W. P. Williams of Madison County served a two-year term from 1882 to 1884.

Before his political career, Paschal served 21 years in the United States Army, retiring in 2006 as a first sergeant. After his military service, he worked with the Alabama Family Rights Association and also served on the Shelby County Republican Executive Committee. He was a commander of the American Legion as well.

Paschal ran for state representative following Matt Fridy's resignation in order to join the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals. Among his other positions, Paschal campaigned against critical race theory. He won the special election on July 13, 2021, becoming the first black Republican elected to the Alabama Legislature since the Reconstruction era. Paschal was sworn in the following day.

In his personal life, Paschal resides in Pelham, Alabama and is a member of the First Baptist Church of Pelham. His tenure in the Alabama House of Representatives began in 2021 and his current term ends in 2026.
