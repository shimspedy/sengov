Jamie Glenn Kiel is an American politician from the state of Alabama. He currently serves as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives for District 18 and is a member of the Republican Party.

Born on December 9, 1974, Kiel embarked on his educational journey at Northwestâ€“Shoals Community College, where he graduated with an Associate's degree in business in 1995. After graduating, Kiel enrolled in the University of North Alabama where he earned a B.S. in Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services in 1997.

While still enrolled at the University of North Alabama in 1996, Kiel started his equipment rental company, Kiel Equipment. The company, which began as a local business, now serves customers across Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Kiel continues to run the company today.

In 2013, Kiel became a managing partner with SAL Properties, a property management company. During his time as owner of Kiel Equipment, Kiel also became a founding member of the Franklin County Broadband Taskforce and a member of the Federal Monitoring Committee for the Franklin County School System.

Kiel announced his run for State House in 2017, after Representative Johnny Mack Morrow announced that he would not be running for reelection. Kiel defeated his Republican Primary opponent, Tony Riley, winning 79.9% of the vote. Kiel then defeated his Democratic opponent, Eddie Britton, by a margin of over 40 points.

Kiel is a member of the Insurance, State Government, and Ways and Means Education committees. He ran for re-election to the Alabama House of Representatives to represent District 18 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.
