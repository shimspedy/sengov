Christopher John England, born on August 19, 1976, is an American politician and a prominent figure in Alabama's political landscape. He has been serving as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from the 70th district since November 8, 2006.

Born and raised in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, England's interest in law and public service was influenced by his father, John H. England Jr., a former judge of the 6th Circuit Court in Alabama, former Tuscaloosa City Council member, and a justice on the Alabama Supreme Court from 1999 to 2000.

England received his Bachelor of Arts from Howard University and his Juris Doctor from the University of Alabama. He is a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and has served on the board of directors of the Police Athletic League and PRIDE.

After graduating from Law School, he began his career at the Tuscaloosa County District Attorney’s office as an Assistant District Attorney. In 2004, he left the District Attorney’s Office to begin working in the Office of the City Attorney for the City of Tuscaloosa where he currently serves as an Associate City Attorney, handling Claims, Franchise Agreements, and Tax Issues.

In November 2019, England made history by becoming the first black chairman of either major political party in the history of the state of Alabama, serving as the Chair of the Alabama Democratic Party until August 2022.

Throughout his political career, England has been a strong advocate for voting rights. In 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that Alabama violated the Voting Rights Act with discriminatory congressional districts, England voted in dissent of the discriminatory districts and condemned the Alabama House of Representatives for letting the "dead bury the living" with the specter of racism.

England continues to serve his community and the state of Alabama with dedication and commitment, striving for a more equitable and just society.
