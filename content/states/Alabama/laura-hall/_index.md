Laura Vandiver Hall, born on January 25, 1943, is an American politician who currently serves in the Alabama House of Representatives representing House District 19 as a Democrat. Hall was first elected to the Alabama House of Representatives by special election in August 1993 and has been re-elected since then.

After graduating from Anderson County Training High School in 1960, she enrolled in Morris College in Sumter, South Carolina, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biology with chemistry as a minor. Further studies earned her a Master of Science degree in science education from Ohio State University and a K-12 administration certification from Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University.

Before her political career, Hall spent over 40 years in the field of education. She served as an administrator at Calhoun Community College and as a teacher at J.O. Johnson High School. Her tenure in the education field extended for over forty years.

Hall is the first African American woman elected to represent House District 19, capturing eighty-six percent of the vote. Results from the 1994 election indicated that she captured 88% percent of the votes. During the 1998 election, she ran unopposed. She won the 2002 election and began serving a fifth term.

Hall is the vice-chair of the Madison County Legislative Delegation and Ranking Minority Member of both the General Fund Finance and Appropriations and Internal Affairs committees. Her sponsored legislation includes: HB 427 which created a system of “Silver Alerts” for which all missing persons with dementia or Alzheimer's disease are eligible, regardless of age, as well as requiring law enforcement personnel to undergo specialized training regarding such cases. HB 474 which designated December 1 as Rosa Parks Day in honor of the “First Lady of Civil Rights.” HB 115 which created a policy by which newborns can be brought to hospitals within 72 hours of birth instead of being abandoned.

Her committee assignments have included: Judiciary Joint Interim on Medicaid. She has also partnered with the City of Huntsville and Madison County Commissioner, District 6 for the past 14 years to run the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program, which gives residents access to free tax return preparation. During this time, more than $16 million have been returned to our community. Representative Hall worked with Representative Jack Williams in co-sponsoring a bill to strengthen Alabama’s fight against human trafficking. She also continues to fight for the rights and well-being of those with mental illness and cognitive disorders, access to healthcare particularly for individuals affected by HIV/AIDS, and the rights of incarcerated and previously incarcerated persons.
