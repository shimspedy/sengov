**Representative Emily Long**

**Party Affiliation:** Democrat  
**District:** Windham-5

Emily J. Long, a dedicated public servant, has been a member of the Vermont House of Representatives since 2015. Born on June 30, 1959, in Townshend, Vermont, Emily grew up in a large family on a small farm where community service was a priority and an expectation. This early exposure to community involvement laid the foundation for her lifelong commitment to public service.

Emily has spent over four decades helping operate a family art business alongside her husband, John, who is an artist. Together, they have two children and one grandchild. Her deep-rooted passion for public education is evident through her extensive service on local school boards since 1994. She continues to serve as a member of her local school board and has held significant roles, including being a longtime member and former president of the Vermont School Boards Association. Additionally, she served on the board of directors of the Vermont School Boards Insurance Trust.

In the Vermont House of Representatives, Emily serves on several key committees, including the House Committee on General, Housing, and Military Affairs, the House Rules Committee, and the Joint Rules Committee. Her legislative priorities focus on access to affordable health care, environmental conservation and sustainable energy, economic development, and education.

Emily's leadership and dedication have not gone unnoticed. She assumed the role of Majority Leader of the Vermont House of Representatives on January 6, 2021, succeeding Jill Krowinski. In this capacity, she continues to advocate for policies that benefit her constituents and the broader Vermont community.

Emily's commitment to her community and her tireless work in the Vermont House of Representatives make her a respected and influential figure in Vermont politics.
