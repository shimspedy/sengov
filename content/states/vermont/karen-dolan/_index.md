KAREN DOLAN is a life-long Vermonter. As a child, Karen primarily grew up in the Northeast Kingdom where she could see Canada from one window and a cornfield from the other. A few years after graduating from the University of Vermont, Karen and her husband, Jason, decided to move to Essex Junction. They have lived there since 2006, raising two amazing children and wrangling two quirky dogs.

Karen has devoted her entire career to the public service sector by leading initiatives to strengthen opportunities for Vermonters. Her efforts have spanned from food security systems and work readiness programs to criminal justice reform and facilitating community dialogue.

As an Essex Junction resident, Karen extends her service efforts by actively engaging in the community. Once her kids were old enough, Karen began volunteering with them, delivering Meals on Wheels and baking at the Ronald McDonald House. Karen has used volunteering as a time to give back and embrace continuous learning. Currently, in addition to serving as a legislator, Karen works at her local community justice center, serves as a substitute teacher and volunteers as a board member for Voices for Inclusion in Essex and Westford.
Member of the House of Representatives: 2021 - present.
