LOGAN NICOLL is excited to be starting his third session in the legislature, representing Ludlow, Mount Holly and Shrewsbury.

Logan a lifelong Vermonter, born and raised in Ludlow, where he still lives today with his wife Cherry and their two daughters. He has spent most of his life in Ludlow aside from his time living in Burlington while he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Community Development from the University of Vermont.

Logan grew up working construction and still does most of the renovations on his own house. He enjoys building and is especially interested in green building and renewable energy systems, earning a minor in Green Building and Community Design while he was at UVM.

Between sessions Logan started a new career in Real Estate and began moonlighting as a bartender at his brother's restaurant bar-arcade in Ludlow, that rumor has it sells the best fried chicken in Vermont.

Logan spends most of his spare time outside with his wife and daughters; in the summer that usually means on the lake or out hiking, in the winter that usually means snowboarding on one of Vermont's great mountains, as a Ludlow native mostly Okemo. Logan and Cherry also love to travel and explore new restaurants. They've been to every corner of Vermont to find the best the state has to offer.
