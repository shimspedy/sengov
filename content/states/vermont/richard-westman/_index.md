Richard Westman, a dedicated public servant, has been a prominent figure in Vermont politics for several decades. Born on March 13, 1959, in Burlington, Vermont, he has spent his entire life in the state, becoming a resident of Cambridge shortly after his birth. His early education took place in Cambridge, Vermont, followed by his high school years at Lamoille Union High School in Hyde Park, Vermont. He pursued higher education at Johnson State College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1982.

Westman's political career began in the Vermont House of Representatives, where he served from 1983 to 2009. During his tenure, he was an active member of various committees, including serving as Chair of the Appropriations and Transportation Committees. His leadership skills were recognized as he held the positions of Assistant Republican Leader and Republican Leader for four years each. In 2009, he was appointed as the Tax Commissioner, a role he held until 2010.

In 2011, Westman transitioned to the Vermont Senate, representing the Lamoille District. His commitment to public service is evident through his involvement in numerous committees. He serves on the Senate Committee on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy as Vice Chair, and several joint committees focused on fiscal matters, health reform, and child protection. Additionally, he co-chairs the Senate Workgroup on Transition Challenges and the Task Force on Affordable, Accessible Health Care.

Beyond his legislative duties, Westman is actively engaged in his community. He works at the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation (VSAC), overseeing the Vermont Higher Education Investment Plan, a 529 College Saving Program. His dedication to education and community service extends to his participation on various nonprofit boards, including the Vermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger, Vermont Center for the Book, and the University of Vermont Board of Trustees.
