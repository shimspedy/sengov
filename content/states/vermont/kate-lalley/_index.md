KATE LALLEY is a Washington, DC native, but has lived in Shelburne since 2003. She attended Kenyon College, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in English, followed by a master’s in landscape architecture from the University of Virginia. Kate maintained a practice in landscape and urban design for 15 years, serving public, private and institutional clients in New England, New York and Washington, DC. Upon moving with her family to Vermont in 2003 her work shifted away from a focus on site design to community planning. Since 2015 Kate has worked as a regional planner. She helps communities to increase attainable housing, especially in walkable contexts to make more affordable, healthful and car-lite lifestyles with easier access to jobs and daily needs available to more Vermonters. In addition to reducing emissions this model also provides opportunities to manage stormwater to protect water quality and other sensitive natural resources.
In Shelburne Kate has been an active community volunteer, most recently serving as a member of the town’s selectboard and prior to that, as a planning commissioner for 15 years.
