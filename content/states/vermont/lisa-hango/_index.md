LISA A HANGO, Republican, of Berkshire, in Franklin County. Born and raised in Catskill, NY, Lisa graduated as valedictorian of the Catskill High School Class of 1980 and from the University of Vermont in 1984 with a BA in economics. Her postcollege career path included employment in the computer, retail sales, and human resources industries in the Boston, MA, area. She moved with her husband, John, to West Virginia in 1988 and eventually became a stay-at-home parent to their four children. With a move back to Vermont in 1990, Lisaâ€™s role expanded to include volunteer service on committees and boards throughout northeastern Franklin County, as well as substitute teaching, religious education, and coaching in the local schools. Currently, Lisa serves on the Northern Mountain Valley Unified Union School District Board, the AgeWell Advisory Council, the Northwestern Medical Center Board of Incorporators, and is a past member of the Franklin County Home Health Agency Board and the RISE-VT Executive Board.
