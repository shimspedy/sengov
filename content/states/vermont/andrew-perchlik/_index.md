Andrew John Perchlik was born on June 3, 1968, in Greeley, Colorado. He is the son of Richard Perchlik, a political science professor at Colorado State College (now the University of Northern Colorado), and Sylvia Marston Perchlik. Andrew grew up in Greeley with his three siblings. He attended an on-campus laboratory school at the University of Northern Colorado from Kindergarten through 12th grade. He later attended the University of Northern Colorado, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental politics.

After college, Andrew joined the Peace Corps and served in Panama. In 1991, he moved to Vermont as a VISTA volunteer, working on home weatherization and fuel assistance projects in Addison County. He briefly returned to Colorado before moving back to Vermont in 1995, where he settled permanently. His family lived in Hubbardton and Randolph Center before moving to Marshfield in 1998, and later to Montpelier in 2017.

Andrew is a recognized expert in sustainable energy. He served as the director of Vermont's Clean Energy Development Fund and was the founding executive director of Renewable Energy Vermont. He has also been a member of the Solar Rating Certification Corporation board of directors and the International Code Council's Renewable Energy Advisory Council.

In 2018, Andrew was elected to the Vermont Senate from the three-member at-large Washington County Senate District. He succeeded Francis K. Brooks and has served alongside Ann Cummings and Anthony Pollina. During his first term, he was appointed to the Senate's Education and Transportation committees.

Andrew is married to Marianne Donahue, and they have three children. The family has been actively involved in their community, with Andrew serving on the volunteer fire department, the Selectboard, as a Justice of the Peace, and on the town energy committee in Marshfield. His experiences with low-income homeowners, high-tech energy companies, and various roles in state and local government have shaped his commitment to public service and sustainable energy.

Senator Andrew Perchlik's journey from Colorado to Vermont, his dedication to sustainable energy, and his commitment to public service highlight his significant contributions to his community and state. His diverse experiences and roles reflect his deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities in creating a vibrant, renewable energy economy in Vermont.
