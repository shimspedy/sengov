SARAH "SARITA" AUSTIN of Colchester, Chittenden County, Democrat, was born in Boston, Mass. At thirteen years old I fell in love with Vermont when my family traveled here for a ski weekend. I attended Windham College in Putney, VT and then went on to UVM for graduate studies in Teacher Education and School Counseling. I began my career in education as a teacher and then accepted a position as the school counselor at the Essex Middle School where I worked, until my retirement, with middle school students, their families and teachers to foster the student's love of learning.
As a former resident of Williston, VT I served on the Williston School Board, CVU School Board, and the Chittenden South Supervisory Union Board.
I also became a volunteer member of the Williston Fire Department/EMT and served on the Williston Community Safety Committee and the Essex Town/Essex Junction School Safety Committee.
I am presently a member of the Colchester Planning Commission and the following Legislative Caucuses: Climate Solutions, Social Equity, National Guard. Member of the House of Representatives: 2019 - current.
