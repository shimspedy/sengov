KRISTI MORRIS, Democrat, of Springfield, Windsor County was born in Springfield, VT, where he attended elementary and primary schools, graduating from Springfield High School. Following high school, he attended Vermont Technical College where he graduated, majoring in Mechanical Engineering.
He is semi-retired from Lovejoy Tool Co., a cutting tool manufacturing company in Springfield, where he was employed full-time for 44 years, 28 as Manager of Engineering, and continues to work a part-time schedule. His full-time responsibilities included overseeing product design, pricing and quotation, quality, inspection, costing, and manufacturing engineering.
Kristi is serving his fifth three-year term on the Springfield Selectboard, where he held the office of Chair for ten of those years. He is an appointed liaison with Springfield Regional Development Corporation (SRDC) and the Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) with the Mt. Ascutney Regional Commission (MARC), formerly (SWCRPC), serving as that committee’s Chairperson.
He is a member of the Springfield Fire Department, serving as a Firefighter/EMT since 1974, and has held the rank of on-call Captain and department Assistant Chief until commencing his term on the Selectboard. He continues to actively serve as a Firefighter/EMT.
He held the office of Potentate for the Mt. Sinai Shriners of Montpelier in 2010, serves as General Chairman of the Shrine Maple Sugar Bowl football game, and is a member of the Board of Governors for Shriners Hospital for Children in Springfield, MA.
Kristi has previously coached freshman boys’ basketball for five years and girls JV basketball for ten years. He has been a member of the Vermont Football Officials Association (VFOA) since 1978, serving many years as a referee.
He and his wife, Sharon, have two adult daughters, five granddaughters, two grandsons, one great-granddaughter and one great-grandson. Following the passing of Rep.
