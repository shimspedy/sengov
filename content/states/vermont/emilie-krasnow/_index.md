EMILIE KRASNOW A native Vermonter, Emilie was born in Middlebury, grew up in Charlotte, and, since 2005, has called South Burlington home. She grew up in a political environment and started door-to-door canvassing in 1994 when her father was first elected to the Vermont legislature: she was seven. Emilie studied leadership and management at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza School of Business. She gives presentations at Vermont high schools and colleges promoting civic engagement and serves on the Community Service Committee of the South Burlington Rotary Club, the South Burlington Library Foundation Volunteer Committee, and the South Burlington Housing Trust Committee. Prior to her election, Emilie worked for seven years at the Vermont State House, four as an assistant in the Vermont Senate and three as an assistant in the Lieutenant Governor’s office. In her spare time, Emilie enjoys trail walking, swimming in Vermont’s rivers, listening to music, writing, film, political discourse, spending time with family and friends, and organizing community events.
