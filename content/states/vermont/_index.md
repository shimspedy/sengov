Vermont became the 14th state to join the Union on March 4, 1791. Vermont’s first two senators, Stephen Bradley and Moses Robinson, took office on October 17, 1791. Vermont’s longest-serving senators include Justin Morrill (1867-1898), George Aiken (1941-1975), and Patrick Leahy (1975-present). Among those who rose to leadership positions are Solomon Foot, George Edmunds, and Patrick Leahy, all of whom served as the Senate’s president pro tempore.
