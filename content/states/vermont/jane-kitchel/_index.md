## Early Life and Education
Martha Jane Beattie Kitchel, known as Jane Kitchel, was born on August 23, 1945, in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. She grew up in Danville, Vermont, on her family's dairy farm. Jane was the second of ten children born to Catherine and Harold Beattie, and she also had four half-siblings. Her upbringing on a fifth-generation Vermont farm instilled in her a strong work ethic and a deep connection to her community. Jane attended Danville High School, graduating in 1963, and went on to earn her bachelor's degree from Wilson College in 1967.

## Early Career
After completing her education, Jane began her career as an entry-level social worker in the St. Johnsbury district office of the Vermont Department of Social Welfare. Her dedication and hard work led to her overseeing six district offices by 1979. In 1985, she was appointed deputy commissioner of the Department of Social Welfare by Governor Madeleine Kunin. Jane's career continued to advance, and in 1992, she was appointed commissioner of the Department of Social Welfare by Governor Howard Dean. Later that year, she became the secretary of the Vermont Agency of Human Services, the state's largest agency, where she served until her retirement in 2002.

## Contributions and Achievements
Throughout her career in Social Welfare and Human Services, Jane played a pivotal role in several key initiatives. She was instrumental in enacting Vermont's 2-1-1 information and referral service and the Ready Up cash assistance program. Governor Howard Dean praised her as the driving force behind his administration's welfare reforms and described her as the architect of Vermont's universal healthcare program, Dr. Dynasaur. This program, established in 1989, provided publicly funded health insurance for children. Jane later proposed expanding Dr. Dynasaur coverage to children in families making up to 300 percent of the federal poverty line, a goal achieved in October 1998.

## Political Career
Jane Kitchel was elected to the Vermont Senate in November 2004, becoming the first Democratic state senator from Caledonia County in 16 years. She has been reelected every two years since, most recently in 2022. During her tenure, she has served on several important committees, including the Senate Committee on Appropriations, which she chaired, and the Senate Committee on Transportation. Jane has also been a member of various joint committees, such as the Joint Fiscal Committee and the Joint Public Pension Oversight Committee.

## Personal Life
Jane Kitchel resides in Danville, Vermont. She was married to Robert Kitchel and has one son. Jane has been actively involved in her community, serving as the former president of the Board of Trustees for the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, and as a member of the Danville Congregational Church. She has also been a board member of the Vermont Food Bank and the Northeastern Vermont Area Health Education Center.

## Retirement
On May 17, 2024, Jane Kitchel announced that she would not run for reelection in 2024, marking the end of a distinguished career in public service. Her contributions to Vermont's social welfare and healthcare systems, as well as her dedication to her community, have left a lasting legacy.
