MARC MIHALY joined the House of Representatives in 2023. He lives in East Calais with his wife, a children’s book author. They have three children and five grandchildren. They live on land in East Calais owned cooperatively by three families, most of it in hay and forest. Marc was born and raised in Cincinnati. After college, he spent two intense years as a Peace Corps volunteer in El Salvador. The mayor of San Salvador, where he lived and worked, was an attorney, and Marc so admired him that he decided to go into law. Marc attended law school in California, worked as a Legal Aid attorney, and then joined the environmental unit of the California Attorney General’s office. In the 1980s, he and two partners started a law firm, one of the nation’s first to focus on public interest environmental cases. For more than twenty years, Marc represented farmers, community groups, tribal governments, and environmentally progressive cities and counties. In 2004, Marc and his wife found their way to Vermont where they have felt truly at home. Marc worked at Vermont Law School as professor, director of the environmental program, and President and Dean, retiring from that post in 2017. He has served as vice chair of the Calais Selectboard, and has sered as a member of the boards of the Vermont Land Trust, VEIC (the parent of Efficiency Vermont), Stone Environmental, the East Calais Community Trust, and UVM’s Rubenstein School. Member of the House of Representatives: 2023-present.
