Senator Terry Williams was born in Rutland, Vermont, and raised in the town of Poultney. He completed his high school education at Poultney High School. Following his graduation, he pursued higher education and earned an associate degree from New Hampshire Technical College. He later obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Regents College in Albany, New York.

In the early stages of his career, Terry worked as an automotive technician from 1972 to 1980. During this period, he also served as the Vermont State Deputy Game Warden from 1978 to 1990. His commitment to public service extended to his military career; he enlisted in the Vermont Army National Guard in 1973 and served until 1979. After his honorable discharge, he became a commissioned armor officer, serving from 1979 until his retirement in 2004. His military service included a combat tour in Afghanistan.

Terry's dedication to his community is evident through his various roles in local governance and organizations. He has served as the vice chairman of the Poultney Selectboard and as a member of the Rutland Regional Planning Commission. Additionally, he is on the board of directors of the Dodge House Veterans Assistance Office. His involvement in veterans' affairs is further highlighted by his memberships in VFW 648-Rutland, the American Legion Post 39-Poultney, and the Disabled American Veterans, where he holds life membership status.

An avid outdoorsman, Terry enjoys hunting, fishing, trapping, skiing, snowshoeing, and gardening. His passion for conservation and sportsmanship is reflected in his roles as vice president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmanâ€™s Clubs and director of the Federation Fund for Conservation and Training. He is also a life member of the NRA and a member of Gun Owners of Vermont.

In his personal life, Terry is divorced and resides in Poultney. He is a proud father of three adult children and a grandfather to five grandchildren. His commitment to public service continues as he represents the Rutland County district in the Vermont Senate, a position he has held since January 2023.
