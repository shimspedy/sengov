Dennis LaBounty is a dedicated public servant and a native of the Northeast Kingdom, Vermont. Born in Newport, Vermont, Dennis has deep roots in the community he now serves. He is married to Diane, and together they have raised three adult sons.

Dennis pursued his education at Berlin Technical College in Berlin, New Hampshire, where he earned a degree in Applied Science. His professional journey began as a machinist, a trade he has been passionate about since 1978. Over the years, he has been an active union member, starting with the Machinist Union (IAM), then the United Electrical Union (IUE), and for the last twenty-four years, the United Steelworkers (USW).

In 1997, Dennis was selected by the steelworkers for a three-month Political Internship in Washington, D.C. During this time, he spent most of his days on Capitol Hill, lobbying legislators and gaining valuable experience in political advocacy. This opportunity led to a full-time position with the United Steelworkers, where he managed contract negotiations, grievances, and arbitrations for thirty-four branches across Vermont, New Hampshire, parts of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and the Northwestern part of New York.

Dennis's commitment to labor rights and advocacy did not go unnoticed. He served as the Political Director of the Vermont AFL-CIO for 18 years, a role in which he was a constant presence at the State House during legislative sessions. He worked closely with legislators, legislative councils, and various labor affiliates to draft and promote legislation that benefited workers. He also oversaw the day-to-day operations of the AFL-CIO office.

After retiring in July 2021, Dennis continued to serve his community in various capacities. He currently drives a school bus for Burke Town School, ensuring the safety and well-being of students. His community involvement extends to coaching Little League, being a board member of the Outing Club of Lyndonville, and volunteering for numerous charitable organizations, including Habitat for Humanity, Coats for Kids, Project Hope, Wounded Warrior, the Wheelchair Project, and the Backpack Food Project.

Dennis is also a member of the Knights of Columbus, reflecting his strong Catholic faith. In his leisure time, he enjoys playing golf, camping, and cheering for his favorite sports teams: the Patriots, Bruins, Celtics, and Red Sox.

Dennis LaBounty's dedication to his community, his extensive experience in labor advocacy, and his commitment to public service make him a respected and influential member of the Vermont House of Representatives. He continues to work tirelessly for the betterment of his constituents and the state of Vermont.
