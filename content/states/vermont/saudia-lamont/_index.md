I am a mother, organizer, advocate, facilitator, equity consultant, and writer who lives in Morrisville. As a graduate of People’s Academy and parent to two students in our school district, I am deeply embedded in our community. 

I am committed to working closely with community partners in order to identify resources and build connections that strengthen our towns. It has been my honor to serve on multiple committees and boards, including Lamoille County Mental Health and the LSUU School Board Equity Committee. As a former early childhood educator, founder of the youth program “Developing D.I.I.V.A.S. (Dignity, Integrity, Independence, Virtue and Self-esteem), and a trained trainer of Prevent Child Abuse VT’s curricula, I have dedicated much of my professional work to supporting youth growth and development.

I am a graduate of Cornell University’s- Diversity and Inclusion program, Leadership Lamoille, Bright Leadership Institute, Recovery Coach Academy, and hold a host of other certifications and skills that I incorporate into my transformative justice work. This spring I graduated from Emerge Vermont’s Signature Training Program, an intensive political training program for Democratic women.
