CHEA WATERS EVANS moved to Vermont when she was 10. She graduated from Charlotte Central School and Champlain Valley Union High School. College took her to St. Lawrence University where she graduated with a BA in fiction writing and an education minor. Her early career focused on publishing and publications in the Boston area before she went to graduate school at City College of New York to study fiction writing. After spending about 18 years living around the country, she came back to Vermont in 2010 to raise her family and develop a career as a local journalist.
Chea was a reporter, copyeditor, and editor at The Citizen, the Shelburne News, and the Charlotte News before founding her own online paper, The Charlotte Bridge. Over the years, she covered everything from a dog falling into a frozen pond to municipal open meeting law violations.
A lifelong community volunteer, Chea continues a 15-year stint volunteering for her three sonsâ€™ schools, and has also volunteered with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, the Hope Lodge, and other local organizations. She is currently a Meals on Wheels delivery driver for Age Well and a Monday Munch volunteer at the Charlotte Senior Center.
