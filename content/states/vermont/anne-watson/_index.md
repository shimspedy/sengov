Anne Elizabeth Watson was born in Burlington, Vermont, and raised in nearby Essex. She graduated from Essex High School in 1999. Anne pursued higher education at Pennsylvania State University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics with a minor in physics in 2003. She furthered her education at the University of Vermont, completing a master's degree in secondary education with a focus on science.

Anne began her teaching career in 2004 as a physics teacher at Montpelier High School. Her dedication to education and her students has been a hallmark of her career. In 2010, she achieved certification from the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards, joining the ranks of the 3.3% of American teachers who hold this certification.

In addition to her teaching career, Anne has been an active coach and advocate for Ultimate Frisbee. She played the sport in college and later coached the Men's Ultimate team at Montpelier High School, leading them to the Vermont finals five times between 2010 and 2017. Her efforts culminated in the recognition of Ultimate as an official varsity-level sport in Vermont's high schools.

Anne's commitment to her community extended beyond education and sports. She served on the Montpelier City Council, representing District 2, starting in 2012. Her leadership and dedication led to her election as Mayor of Montpelier in 2018, a position she held until 2022. During her tenure as mayor, she was recognized for her innovative and community-focused approach, earning accolades such as being named one of "five of the coolest mountain-city mayors" in the United States by REI in 2018.

In January 2023, Anne transitioned to a new role as a member of the Vermont Senate, representing the Washington district. Her legislative work focuses on various committees, including the Senate Committee on Government Operations and the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, where she serves as Vice Chair.

Anne lives in Montpelier with her husband and son. In her free time, she enjoys playing Ultimate Frisbee, crocheting, and spending quality time with her family. Her journey from educator to politician reflects her unwavering commitment to serving her community and making a positive impact in Vermont.
