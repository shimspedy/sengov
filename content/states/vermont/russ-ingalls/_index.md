Senator Russ Ingalls represents the Essex-Orleans District in the Vermont Senate. Born in Japan in 1964, Russ is the second of four boys. His father was a career Navy man, which meant Russ spent much of his early life traveling the world. He lived in various places, including Cuba, Winter Harbor in Maine, the Philippines, Montpelier in Vermont, and Adak in Alaska. Upon his father's retirement, the family settled back in Irasburg, Vermont, where Russ attended 8th grade and graduated from Lake Region Union High School in 1983.

After high school, Russ became a business partner in a dairy farm he worked at during his school years. When the farm ceased operations, he moved to Burlington and then to Brandon, Vermont, before returning to Irasburg in 1989 to work with his father in a dairy supply business. When that business was sold, Russ embarked on a 20-year career in the automobile industry, starting in sales and eventually becoming the General Manager of the dealership where he began. During this time, he also started and sold several businesses and invested in real estate.

In 2009, Russ co-founded a real estate company with a friend who had recently sold his business. They later acquired another partner and her successful real estate business, forming RE/MAX All Seasons Realty, which the three partners continue to operate successfully today.

Russ's call to public service began when his hometown of Irasburg struggled to maintain a full selectboard. He was elected to two terms but had to resign when he moved to Newport, making him ineligible to continue serving Irasburg. In 2020, Russ decided to run for the Vermont Senate, aiming to provide a stronger voice for the Northeast Kingdom. He secured one of the two available seats by emphasizing the importance of making decisions that prioritize Vermonters, particularly his constituents.

In addition to his political career, Russ is a top producer in real estate. He enjoys spending his free time with his fianc√©e, Deb, and their families and friends. Russ prefers outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, golfing, boating, and walking. His genuine ability to connect with people has been key to his successes in life. Russ passionately believes in helping others, always mindful that there are those who are worse off and in need of assistance.
