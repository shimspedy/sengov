JANA BROWN of Richmond, Chittenden County, Democrat, grew up in Fair Haven, VT, a rural town in Rutland County. She is a graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University and The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. Her public service career began at the Ohio Attorney General’s Office before she moved back home to Vermont to continue her legal career. Jana spent four and a half years working in Montpelier for the Vermont Attorney General’s Office in the Civil Litigation division. She completed the Vermont Leadership Institute program run by the Snelling Center for Government in 2013.

After working in the early childhood field for a few years, she completed the Vermont Early Childhood Leadership Institute run by the Snelling Center for Government in 2017. Issues impacting children and families in Vermont, such as food insecurity, lack of affordable, high-quality childcare, and school equity issues have inspired her to serve as State representative.
