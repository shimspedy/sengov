PETER D. ANTHONY was born in 'Hell's Kitchen', Manhattan, hours after allied troops landed in France. Public school education culminated in a diploma from Nauset Regional HS, Orleans, Massachusetts. (Yes, on the Cape.) College initially brought him to Vermont; earning a BA at Goddard in 1966. This began a lifelong interest in economics, public policy and history. Graduate work at the New School back in the NYC ultimately resulted in a PhD degree.His many jobs included; dairy farm labor in Plainfield; Harley mechanic in Barre; and granite hauler to metro New York.
Realizing that a PhD allowed some job mobility, Peter accepted a professorship at Castleton. During more than two decades many students from central Vermont studied the rudiments of market capitalism in his classes; including more than one legislator. With wife Marsha & our two (now grown) children. we settled in Barre. Castleton's tenure allowed Peter to fill most faculty duties. He is proud of endowing a scholarship honoring the environmental leadership of Vermont's own Mollie Beattie.
Interspersed with college teaching Peter attended Vt. Law in So. Royalton. With a Masters in Environmental Policy to his credit teaching range and participation in public policy arenas widened. Peter participated in the Natl. Governor's Assn. Policy Academy; Vt. Economic Progress Council; served on boards: CV Land Trust; CV Community Action; Granite City Housing; Vt Institute for Government; Jobs Partnership & Training Act; Consolidated Council on Employment and Training (architect of WIB workforce training model); school-to-work steering Committee; President, Green Mountain Transit; Treasurer, CV Solid Waste Mgt. District. And since its founding 25 years ago, board member of the Vt. Granite Museum of Barre, production home 'CERES' now atop the dome. Municipal public service has been a mainstay: Peter served on the Barre City Council; as Mayor; as JP on the Board. Of Civil Authority; and as Pres. of the Barre Democratic Comm.
