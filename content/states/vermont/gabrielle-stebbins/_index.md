GABRIELLE STEBBINS has worked to build an equitable, sustainable, and prosperous future for over twenty years. Born in Newton, Massachusetts, Gabrielle studied at Rice University in Texas, where she received two degrees (bachelor of music in classical violin and bachelor of arts in anthropology, Cum Laude) followed by a master’s degree in development policy (with Distinction) from the Nelson Mandela University in South Africa. She has had the incredible fortune to grow and to serve throughout the world as a classical violinist, a counselor at a women’s health clinic, a researcher on child labor and human rights issues, a park ranger, a river restoration manager, a community organizer addressing air quality and public safety, an energy efficiency program coordinator, and executive director of Vermont’s renewable energy trade association. When not at the legislature, she works as a managing consultant at Hinesburg-based Energy Futures Group, where she assists residents, communities, and utilities in efficiently shifting to renewable energy. She has served or is serving on a variety of Boards, including as Chair of the Burlington Electric Commission (through 2022), Policy Member for the American Public Power Association, advisory board member for Energy Action Network, and co-chairs of the Vermont General Assemblies' Climate Solutions Caucus and the Vermont Climate Workforce Network Action Group. She lives in the South End of Burlington with her husband, two young daughters, and their fantastic mutt, Lola.
