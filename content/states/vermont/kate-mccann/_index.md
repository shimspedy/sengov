KATE MCCANN was born in Lancaster, New Hampshire, the oldest of three daughters. She attended Lancaster Elementary School and White Mountains Regional High School, from which she graduated in 1992. She received her MA in curriculum and instruction from the University of Vermont in 1998 and made teaching her life’s work. Kate’s priority has always been creating long-lasting, close personal connections with young people while sharing her enthusiasm and passion for problem solving. In 2004, after teaching for six years in California, she returned to Vermont to start a family. She has been an active member of the teachers’ union and has served as chief negotiator, vice president and co-president, a position she currently holds. In 2012, Kate became National Board certified, and, in 2015, she was awarded the Presidential Award for Excellence in Math and Science Teaching. In 2017, she was chosen to represent her profession as the Vermont State Teacher of the Year. During the 2018–2019 school year, she was an Albert Einstein Distinguished Educators fellow and spent 11 months in Washington, DC where she worked for Ohio Congresswoman Martha Fudge providing K–12 counsel and input and performing a number of other legislative assistant duties. In 2021, she was awarded an NEA Foundation Global Learning Fellowship which culminated in a field experience in Peru in 2022. Kate also served on the legislative Pensions Benefit, Design and Funding Taskforce in 2021 whose recommendations were drafted into a bill that became a Vermont law, unanimously supported by both the House and the Senate. She has served on the board of the Vermont Council of Teachers of Mathematics since 2011. In 2016, she directed the first VCTM Statewide Math Fair for K–12 students, and, from 2019 until 2022 she served on Montpelier’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Kate currently serves as the math state coordinator for the Presidential Award for Excellence in Math and Science Teaching. In addition to teaching, Kate and her husband have owned and operated North Branch Vineyards since 2007. Kate enjoys kayaking, cooking, and spending time with family and friends. She lives in Montpelier with her husband and their two daughters.
