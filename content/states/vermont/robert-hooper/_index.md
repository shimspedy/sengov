BOB HOOPER has lived in the New North End, in both Wards 4 and 7, for over 30 years. He has committed his entire life to public service beginning with a tour of duty in the Army in 1971, where he became a radio operator in the signal corps, like his father in WWII. Shortly after discharge, Bob worked his way through college at Penn State University where in 1979, he earned a B.A. in Individual and Family Studies with an emphasis in Counseling.
Following graduation, Bob joined the private sector in a construction company that focused on the then novel concept of designing and constructing solar homes. This experience developed Bobâ€™s interest in alternative energy, an issue he remains committed to today. He also experienced first-hand the challenges of operating a small business as a long haul moving van driver. These experiences were the genesis of his commitment to helping small businesses succeed.
Member of the House of Representatives: 2019 - present.
