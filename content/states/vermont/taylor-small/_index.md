TAYLOR SMALL of Winooski, Chittenden County, Progressive/Democrat, was elected in November 2020 and serves as Vermont's first and only out transgender legislator and one of ten in the United States. Small was born and raised in New England and came back to Vermont for high school in 2010. She then went on to graduate from the University of Vermont with a bachelor’s degree in human development and family studies and a minor in sexuality and gender identity studies in 2016 and has lived in the greater Burlington area since. In her first year in office, Small was able to ban the use of the 'LGBTQ+ Panic Defense' in Vermont with unanimous support and has been a strong leader on equitable public school funding and addressing the overdose crisis by centering harm reduction and the prevention of death. Following her first term, Small received global recognition by One Young World as 'Politician of the Year' and was the only person from the United States to win this award. In 2022, she was elected as the Assistant House Progressive Caucus Leader and serves on the House Human Services Committee as well as the House Discrimination Prevention Panel. Outside of the legislature, Small delivers cultural humility training for healthcare and human service providers across the state with a priority for rural and smaller practices, and has trained over 2,000 providers in her tenure. She currently lives in Winooski with her fiancé, Carsen, and two dogs, Charlie & Theo.
