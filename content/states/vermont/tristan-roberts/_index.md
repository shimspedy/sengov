TRISTAN ROBERTS is the Representative from Halifax, a town of 800 on our southern border.
Rep. Roberts has made Vermont his home since 1998, after growing up on an old dairy farm in New York’s Upper Hudson Valley. He graduated from Marlboro College with a BA in cognitive science in 2000. He lived in Brattleboro before settling in Halifax in 2005.

Over the last two decades, Roberts has helped architects and builders remove obstacles to building healthy and energy-efficient homes, schools, healthcare facilities, and offices. Sustainability professionals turn to Roberts for guidance in the midst of ever-evolving codes and certifications and fluctuating market conditions. His leadership on the Health Product Declaration (HPD), a voluntary transparency label adopted by an industry-consensus process, has helped tens of thousands of construction projects around the world reduce their use of toxic chemicals.

Roberts’ care and concern for Vermonters and their small communities led him to chair Halifax’s Broadband Committee in 2019, to run for Selectboard in 2021, and to run for State Representative in 2022.
Roberts lives with his partner, son, and dog on their homestead, Quill Nook Farm. He writes stories of their life and land in his newspaper column and blog, This Spot on Earth.
