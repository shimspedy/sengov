Mike Rice was elected to represent the Bennington-Rutland district, which includes the towns of Danby, Dorset, Landgrove, Mt. Tabor, and Peru, in the Vermont House of Representatives in 2022. As a dedicated Democrat, he serves on the House Committee on Agriculture, Food Resiliency, and Forestry. In this role, he works tirelessly to support Vermont’s working lands, promote sound stewardship, and enhance community food security. Additionally, Mike is a key member of the leadership team of the Climate Solutions Caucus, the legislature’s largest issue-oriented caucus. Here, he collaborates with a broad coalition of legislators from across Vermont to advance policies related to climate change adaptation, mitigation, and resilience.

Born and raised in Upstate New York, Mike received his Bachelor of Arts in English, with an interdisciplinary minor in Environmental Policy, from the State University of New York at Albany, graduating magna cum laude. His journey to Vermont began in 2017 when he worked on a farm, helping with the harvest and learning to make value-added products like cider and wine to support the farm’s viability. This experience deepened his appreciation for Vermont’s agricultural heritage and the collaborative spirit of its farming communities.

In 2018, Mike and his partner Sean moved to Vermont, where they faced and navigated the challenges of rural living, including housing availability and affordability, job opportunities and wages, access to healthcare providers, and the lack of paid family and medical leave. Despite these challenges, they found a welcoming community in Dorset. Mike continued his education, earning a Master’s degree in Food and Agriculture Law and Policy, with distinction, from Vermont Law School while working full-time. His professional experience includes working for a local dairy farm and creamery, and later, engaging in regional policy and funding solutions for projects focused on food security, soil health, pollinator protection, and food system equity with the Northeast Organic Farming Association.

Mike’s commitment to public service and his community is evident in his legislative work. He is part of the next generation of leadership for Vermont, striving to make a positive impact on the state’s agricultural policies and climate initiatives. Mike and Sean continue to live in Dorset, where Sean splits his time between one of the region’s oldest manufacturing companies and his own start-up small business. Together, they are deeply invested in the well-being and future of their community.
