First elected to the Washington House of Representatives in 2016, Nicole Macri (43rd District, Seattle)  has been a legislative leader in housing justice, health care access, and in enacting protections for LGBTQ people and people with disabilities. She has passed policies that expand access to health care, promote reproductive justice, increase affordable housing, protect renters and workers, address homelessness and expand LGBTQ civil rights.

Nicole is Vice Chair of the Appropriations Committee, serves on the Health Care and Wellness Committee, and co-chairs the Legislative LGBTQ Caucus. She also serves as a legislative advisor to the State’s LGBTQ Commission, and as a member of the Long Term Support Services Trust Commission, the Joint Select Committee on Health Care and Behavioral Health and the Select Committee on Pension Policy.

In 2019, Nicole was named one of Seattle’s most influential people by Seattle Magazine and again in 2021 by Seattle Met magazine. In 2022, Nicole received the Human Right to Housing Award from the National Homelessness Law Center. Outside the Legislature, she is Deputy Director of the Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC) which provides housing, integrated health care, and other social services in the Seattle area.

The 43rd legislative district includes the Seattle neighborhoods of Belltown, Downtown, South Lake Union, First Hill, Capitol Hill, Madison Valley, Broadmoor,  Madison Park, Denny Blaine, Eastlake, Portage Bay, Montlake, Laurelhurst, University District, Wallingford and Fremont. The district also has the distinction of being served by an openly LGBTQ person longer than any other seat in the world.
