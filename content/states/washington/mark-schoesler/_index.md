Senator Mark Schoesler represents the 9th Legislative District, which spans part or all of Adams, Asotin, Columbia, Franklin, Garfield, Lincoln, Spokane, and Whitman counties. His district begins just north of Spangle and Rockford, extends south of Asotin, west to Othello and half of Pasco, and reaches the Idaho border on the east. Within these boundaries, he proudly represents Washington State University in Pullman.

Senator Schoesler was elected to the House of Representatives in 1993 and served for 12 years. In 2004, he was elected to the Washington State Senate, where he currently serves as the Senate Republican Leader in the Senate Republican Caucus. He is a fifth-generation dryland wheat farmer in Ritzville, Adams County, on land his family has farmed since the 1880s.

Senator Schoesler and his wife Ginger are proud parents of two married children, Veronica and Cody, and grandparents to a grandson and two granddaughters. His commitment to agricultural issues and small business prosperity has earned him numerous awards and recognitions.
