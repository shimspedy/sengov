Kevin has lived in Southwest Washington his entire life, and his roots run deep in his community. He is an active, local business leader who is serving on several community boards. He started his familyâ€™s business, Backwoods Brewing, and grew it into more than 70 employees.

From 2010 to 2019, Kevin was a Port of Skamania Commissioner and has since taken on the role of economic development manager for Skamania County and Skamania EDC executive director. He plans to continue his service to the community as he represents the 17th State House District in Olympia.

By cutting taxes and keeping government out of the way of small businesses, Kevin plans to make Clark/Skamania County the best place in the country for families to live and grow.

Kevin also strongly supports law enforcement, being a former corrections officer. With the crime rate escalating, Kevin believes in fully funding law enforcement offices to protect individuals and families and avoid making the mistakes that have been so prevalent in Olympia and throughout Washington.

In the state House of Representatives, Kevin serves on four committees, including the Capital Budget and Innovation, Community & Economic Development, & Veterans committees. He also serves on the Postsecondary Education & Workforce and Regulated Substance & Gaming committees.

Kevin has been married to his wife Jami for 11 years and they have two young daughters, Lindsey and Avery. He looks look forward to serving his community and being the voice in Olympia for Clark and Skamania Counties. Working on the issues that matter to his constituents and bringing results to the 17th District is his top priority.
