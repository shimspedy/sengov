Mark Mullet is proud to represent the 5th Legislative District communities of Black Diamond, Issaquah, Maple Valley, North Bend, Renton, Sammamish, and Snoqualmie.

First elected to the Senate in 2012, Mark is currently the Vice Chair of the Senate Ways & Means Committee, where he also serves as the leader of the Senate’s capital budget team. The capital budget makes infrastructure investments across Washington, funding affordable housing, school construction, health care facilities, environmental projects, and much more, while creating tens of thousands of jobs. Mark also serves on the Senate Early Learning & K-12 Education Committee and the Senate Business, Financial Services, Gaming & Trade Committee.

Mark’s accomplishments in the Senate include securing funding for a new interchange at S.R. 18 and I-90, money to open the new Tahoma High School in Maple Valley, and other infrastructure investments across the district. Mark also sponsored and passed legislation enacting a $400 million property tax cut, expanding college financial aid, helping combat credit card fraud, allowing annexation of the Maple Valley Donut Hole, and much more. He’s widely recognized as a collaborative legislator skilled at bringing people together across the aisle to work on major issues like affordable housing, access to college, and public safety.

Mark currently owns several small businesses, including a Zeeks Pizza restaurant and four Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream shops. From 2009 to 2013 Mark served on the Issaquah City Council. Before that, Mark worked for more than twelve years in International Finance at Bank of America, and UBS, before returning home to Washington in 2006.

Mark earned a Master’s degree in public administration from the Evans School at the University of Washington in 2008 and he graduated Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor’s degree in Finance from Indiana University in 1994.   He attended Foster High School in Tukwila and was the Washington State High School tennis champion in 1989 and 1990.

Mark’s wife Kelley has been a teacher in the Issaquah school district since 1999.  They have six children, ranging in age from middle school to college, and they all currently attend or graduated from public school in the Issaquah School district.
