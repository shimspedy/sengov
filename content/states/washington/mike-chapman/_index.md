Mike Chapman is a Democratic member of the Washington State Senate, representing the 24th Legislative District. He assumed office on December 6, 2024, and his current term is set to end in January 2029.

Before his tenure in the Senate, Chapman served as a member of the Washington State House of Representatives from 2017 to 2024. During this time, he was known for his dedication to addressing the needs of his constituents in Clallam, Jefferson, and parts of Grays Harbor counties. His legislative priorities often focused on economic development, environmental conservation, and improving public infrastructure.

Chapman’s career in public service began long before his time in the state legislature. He served as a Clallam County Commissioner for four terms, where he gained valuable experience in local governance and community engagement. Prior to that, he worked as a U.S. Customs Inspector and a local law enforcement officer, roles that shaped his understanding of public safety and border security.

Chapman holds a master’s degree in Leadership and Liberal Studies from Duquesne University, a bachelor’s degree in Organizational Management from Northwest University, and an associate degree from Shoreline Community College. His academic background complements his practical experience, enabling him to approach legislative challenges with a well-rounded perspective.

Residing in Port Angeles, Washington, Chapman is deeply connected to his community. He lives with his wife, Bobbi, and they have two grown sons. Outside of his legislative duties, he is an advocate for education, healthcare, and sustainable resource management, reflecting his commitment to the long-term well-being of his district and the state of Washington.
