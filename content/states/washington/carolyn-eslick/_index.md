Growing up on a farm, and working with her mother at the dry-cleaners by age eleven, taught Carolyn Eslick the value of hard work and commitment to purpose. As a restaurant owner for over 20 years, Carolyn learned the complexities of running a business first-hand.  Looking to help others start and grow their businesses, she founded and helped manage GroWashington, a business development and retail incubator.

As a small business owner in the City of Sultan, Carolyn learned how to face adversity head-on. When some new retail shops sought to place their entrances in front of Highway 2 instead of Main Street, which is in the cityâ€™s heart, she fought for a better solution. That got her started in local government.  After serving as a city council member, she served more than nine years as the mayor of Sultan. Initially appointed, Carolyn was later elected in 2018 as a state representative for the 39th District.

As a locally elected official, and now a state representative, Carolyn continues to show an unwavering commitment to finding solutions to mental health, housing, and public safety issues. She is also a powerful advocate for the prevention and rehabilitation of adult and teen substance abuse. A former board member for the Boys and Girls Club, Carolyn believes in helping young people reach their full potential.

Carolyn lives in Sultan with her husband, Chuck Donaldson, a retired high school shop and agriculture teacher. They have a blended family, with six children and eight grandchildren.
