Michelle was born and raised in Kitsap County and she is the fourth generation in her family to reside there. Michelle is a proud mother and has fostered several children over the years.

After earning her Associates of Arts and Science degree at Olympic College, Michelle went on to earn her Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Washington. She then attended the University of Washington School of Dentistry, receiving her Doctor of Dental Surgery degree.

Prior to serving in the Washington State Legislature, Michelle devoted her dental practice to serving nursing home residents around Puget Sound. She donated thousands of hours to caring for the underserved, and chaired the Access to Care Committee for several years. Michelle was also an affiliate professor at the University of Washington School of Dentistry for nearly a decade.

In 2013, Michelle joined others to successfully lobby the Legislature to restore funding to adult dental care for those on Medicaid. As a state representative, she continues to fight for those who cannot care for themselves. Michelleâ€™s other legislative priorities include the issues of affordability, education, public safety and state government accountability.
