Dave Paul is a Democratic member of the Washington House of Representatives. Born in 1968, he grew up in Enumclaw, Washington. His father was a shop steward, and his mother was a para-educator and small business owner. Dave graduated from Seattle University and went on to earn a master’s degree from Miami University (Ohio) and a doctorate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

With over 25 years of experience in education, Dave has taught at various levels. For the past 16 years, he has been helping students at Skagit Valley College, where he currently serves as the Director of Community Relations. His background includes assisting non-traditional students in navigating the changing employment landscape. Additionally, Dave is actively involved in the Island County Economic Development Council.

Dave's legislative priorities reflect his commitment to improving various aspects of Washington State:

1. Higher Education Affordability : Dave championed the creation of the summer Running Start program (House Bill 1316, 2023). This program allows high school juniors and seniors to enroll in tuition-free college courses during the summer term, providing them with a head start on their college education.

2. Healthcare Accessibility : He worked on capping the cost of epinephrine injectors (epi-pens) and inhalers at $35 for a 30-day supply (House Bill 1979, 2024), making these essential medications more affordable.

3. Mental Health Support : Dave has secured funding over the last three years to improve outreach and services for youth and children in rural communities, addressing mental health challenges.

4. Environmental Stewardship : Dave played a key role in passing landmark legislation (House Bill 1700) that helps local governments and ports remove abandoned boats from waterways. This program prevents pollution and saves taxpayers millions of dollars.

5. Transportation Advocacy : As Vice Chair of the House Transportation Committee, Dave fought for historic investments in Washington State Ferries. These investments include $196 million for hybrid electric vessel construction and terminal electrification, funding for five new hybrid electric ferries, additional crew members, and support for Able Bodied Sailors and Licensed Deck officers.

6. Veterans' Rights: Dave's commitment extends to veterans and active-duty personnel. He ensured that veterans serving as teachers, firefighters, and police officers can earn the public employee retirement credits they deserve (House Bill 1007, 2023). He also supported granting in-state tuition for veterans and their children transitioning from military service to civilian life (House Bill 2543, 2020).

7. Public Safety: Dave funded more cohorts at the state’s law enforcement academy, advocated for increased pay for Washington State Troopers, and strengthened training and support for 911 first responders.

Dave Paul's dedication to education, healthcare, the environment, and public safety continues to make a positive impact on Washington State.
