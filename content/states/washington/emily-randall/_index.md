Emily Randall, born and raised on the Kitsap Peninsula in a hardworking union family, is an American politician and community organizer. She was elected to the Washington State Senate in November 2018, representing the 26th Legislative District.

**Early Life and Education:**
Growing up in Port Orchard, Emily learned the value of education from her parents and teachers. Her father worked at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and her mother began a career as a para-educator during Emily's high school years. As the first in her family to attend a four-year college, she understands the importance of accessible higher education. Emily holds a degree from Wellesley College.

**Advocacy and Legislative Work:**
Emily's advocacy work centers on expanding education opportunities and improving access to affordable healthcare. Her sister, Olivia, was born with severe developmental and physical disabilities, and their family's access to Medicaid allowed Olivia to live a fulfilling life at home for 19 years. Emily believes that all families should have healthcare access without risking bankruptcy.

In her first legislative session, Emily sponsored and passed the Reproductive Health Care for All bill, emphasizing reproductive rights. She also worked toward universal healthcare. As Deputy Majority Leader, she continues to chair the Senate Higher Education & Workforce Development Committee and serves on the Senate Health & Long Term Care and Ways & Means committees.

Emily Randall is proud to put people first, advocating for affordable higher education and expanded healthcare access for all.
