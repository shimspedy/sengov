Vandana Slatter is a Democratic member of the Washington State Senate, representing the 48th Legislative District. She assumed office on January 7, 2025, and her current term is set to end in January 2029.

Dr. Vandana Slatter has a rich and diverse background that combines public service, healthcare, and education. Before her tenure in the Senate, she served four consecutive terms in the Washington State House of Representatives, where she championed legislation aimed at expanding access to education, protecting healthcare privacy, and addressing climate change. Her dedication to public service began even earlier, as a Bellevue City Councilmember, where she worked on initiatives to improve community well-being and sustainability.

Dr. Slatter's professional career is equally impressive. She is a licensed pharmacist and has over two decades of experience as a clinical scientist in leading biotech companies. Her expertise in healthcare has been a driving force behind her legislative priorities, including expanding access to healthcare and defending reproductive rights. She also served on the Washington State Board of Pharmacy, where she contributed to shaping healthcare policies.

An advocate for education and workforce development, Dr. Slatter believes that investing in post-secondary education is crucial for the future of Washington State. She has also been a strong proponent of environmental protection and the growth of a green economy. In the Senate, she serves as vice chair of the Environment, Energy & Technology Committee and is a member of the Health & Long-Term Care and Higher Education & Workforce Development committees.

Dr. Slatter's academic achievements include a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy from the University of British Columbia, a Doctor of Pharmacy from the University of Washington, and a Master of Public Administration from the Evans School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington. Her commitment to excellence extends beyond academics; she was also a gold medalist in fencing during her university years.

Vandana Slatter and her husband, Greg, have been residents of Bellevue since 2003. Together, they are deeply involved in their community, reflecting her belief in putting people first and fostering a better future for all.
