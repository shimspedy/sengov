Virginia “Jenny” Graham, graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1983.  She has been a licensed Professional Cosmetologist and Esthetician since 1984.  Her parents owned and operated a trucking company, which provided Jenny the opportunity to see firsthand what it takes to successfully operate a small business.  This experience also led her to serve in the transportation field in the Army Reserves.

Jenny is a former small business owner. She is a veteran, wife, mother, and victims’ advocate.  She is the survivor of abuse, and her sister was a victim of the Green River Killer.

Jenny began to question why the law was not adequately protecting victims and in 2011 she began working with legislators, prosecutors, law enforcement and other survivors to challenge and then to change the unfair statute of limitations laws.  Her efforts culminated in legislation being signed by Gov. Inslee in 2014.

She volunteered at her children’s schools, church, and served as a Cub Scout Den Mother for pack 183.  Jenny is a registered Taekwondo martial arts instructor and has served as a ski coach for the developmentally disabled.

In her spare time, Jenny enjoys home improvement and recycling projects and is an avid outdoor enthusiast.  She loves camping and exploring underwater beauty as a certified scuba diver.
