Skyler David Rude (born 1986) is an American politician who has been serving in the Washington House of Representatives since January 3, 2019. He was elected in 2018 to succeed retiring Republican Terry Nealey. Rude holds the distinction of being the only openly gay Republican in the Washington State House.

Early Life and Education :
Skyler Rude was born, raised, and educated in Walla Walla, Washington. His deep connection to the region stems from his family's long history there, dating back to 1861 when his ancestors pioneered the Walla Walla Valley. As a child, Skyler actively participated in the family farm, gaining practical experience in growing irrigated crops, managing orchards, and tending to dryland farming.

He earned an Associate degree from Walla Walla Community College, further solidifying his ties to the local community and its rich agricultural heritage.

Career and Community Service :
Before entering the Legislature, Skyler worked as the legislative assistant to 16th District Senator Maureen Walsh starting in 2015. In 2019, he was sworn in as the state representative for the 16th District, which encompasses all of Walla Walla and parts of Benton and Franklin counties.

Rude's commitment to bipartisanship and collaboration within the Legislature has been a defining theme of his work. In his first year, he co-founded a bipartisan work group to facilitate opportunities for legislators to work together and build relationships. Beyond his standing legislative committee assignments, Skyler serves on various bipartisan and non-partisan committees and boards, including the Legislative Evaluation and Accountability Program Committee, Educational Opportunity Gap Oversight and Accountability Committee, Capitol Furnishings Preservation Committee, LGBTQ Commission, Columbia Basin College EMS Program Advisory Committee, GATE Partnership Advisory Committee, School Safety Summit, and the National Conference of State Legislatures' Nuclear Legislative Working Group.

Personal Interests :
In his spare time, Skyler enjoys camping, road trips, floating down the Walla Walla River, and working on a restoration project for a 1910s farm wagon.
