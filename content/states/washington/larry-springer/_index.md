Larry Springer is the Deputy Majority Leader in the House of Representatives. A lifelong resident of East King County, he served 11 years on the Kirkland City Council, including four as Mayor. Owner of a retail wine store since 1985, Larry is proud of his family-run small business.

Larry began his career as an elementary school teacher, only to be drawn away by his passion for the art and intricacies of fine wine. After opening his store in Kirkland, Larry became involved in the community. As a small business owner, he felt that it was part of his responsibility to help revitalize the community. He continues to use that experience to build bridges between the small business community and the Legislature.

Since his election to the Legislature in 2004, Larry has been an advocate for education, economic development, the arts, and creating “community.” His work was instrumental in bringing a Performing Arts Center to Kirkland.

Larry is a member of the Kirkland Chamber of Commerce, served as President of the Suburban Cities Association, represented the Eastside community as a board member of HopeLink, and was a founding board member of Leadership Eastside. As a City Council member and Mayor, Larry received the National Distinguished Leadership Award.

Larry and his wife enjoy spending time at their mountain cabin with their two golden retrievers.
