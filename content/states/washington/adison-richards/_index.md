Adison Richards is a Democratic Party member serving in the Washington House of Representatives. He represents District 26, Position 1. Richards assumed office on January 13, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 11, 2027.

Adison Richards grew up in the 26th district, where he was raised by a teacher and a small business owner who ran a landscaping company. He attended Peninsula High School and has lived in various parts of the district, including Fox Island and Bremerton. His deep connection to the community has been a driving force in his political career.

Before entering politics, Richards worked as a nonprofit attorney, dedicating his career to serving underprivileged communities. He has been actively involved in community service, volunteering as a cross-country coach and working with local organizations such as the NAACP. His advocacy has focused on issues like affordable housing, environmental protection, and public education funding.

Richards first ran for the Washington House of Representatives in 2022 but narrowly lost the general election. Undeterred, he ran again in 2024 and won, defeating his opponent with a campaign that emphasized bipartisan cooperation and community-based solutions. His platform includes progressive policies aimed at improving public safety, hiring more police officers, and enhancing government efficiency, all while opposing new tax proposals.

In his current role, Richards serves on several committees, including Housing, Agriculture & Natural Resources, and Transportation. He is committed to addressing the needs of his constituents and fostering a collaborative approach to governance. His dedication to public service and his ability to connect with people from all walks of life have made him a respected figure in his district.
