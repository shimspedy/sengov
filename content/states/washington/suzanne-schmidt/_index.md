Suzanne is serving her first term representing the 4th District which includes Spokane Valley, Liberty Lake, Millwood and the communities of Colbert, Chattaroy, Green Bluff and Newman Lake.

She grew up in Libby, Montana where her dad owned and operated a small business, and her mom was a school bus driver.

Suzanne put herself through college as a single mom to two boys. She worked as a park ranger at Libby Dam during college and after graduating accepted a permanent job with the Corps of Engineers at Libby Dam.

After meeting her husband Dean, who was the Chief of Technical Engineering for the Seattle District Corps of Engineers, she moved to Spokane with her two sons, and in 1998, Dean and Suzanne welcomed their third son. They’ve lived in the same house in Spokane Valley for 25 years. Their children, and now grandchildren, have attended schools in the Central Valley School District.

Since 1999, Suzanne has represented Washington employers by providing workers’ compensation claims management, Labor and Industries account management, safety consulting services, and compliance recommendations.

In 2016, Suzanne was appointed President/CEO of Associated Builders and Contractors Inland Pacific Chapter. In the last six years, she has worked closely with legislators, as well as city and county elected officials, to slow down or stop tax increases and regulations that impair economic growth.
