Mari Lynn Kruger Leavitt (née Hyzer; born 1968) is an American politician from Washington. She serves in the Washington House of Representatives for the 28th legislative district in Pierce County.

Background and Advocacy :
Mari Leavitt is a mom, small business owner, education and PTSA leader, and a strong supporter of Washington’s military families. As a child of a military family and former human services administrator, Rep. Leavitt is well aware of the pressing needs for service-members, veterans, and their families. These needs include housing, child care, licensing for spouses to get to work, health care, behavioral health services, and other supports.

Legislative Accomplishments :
- Her first law was a pay increase for Washington National Guard members who are called in for wildland fire response—the first pay increase for those Guard members who do that work in 30 years.
- She established a cost of living increase for retired public workers who hadn’t seen a permanent increase in over a decade.
- Mari pushed for increased safety measures at state hospitals, sales tax exemptions for affordable housing, and for organizations addressing homelessness.
- She secured construction projects all over Pierce County, including enhancing community and technical college facilities and projects for the University of Washington at Tacoma, as well as highway improvement and expansion projects to reduce traffic congestion.

Education and Workforce Development :
With over 23 years of experience in higher education as a college administrator, Mari worked to make college and workforce development training more affordable. She expanded community and technical education opportunities to help students succeed, whether in high school or returning for worker retraining or to gain advanced skills. Her knowledge and experience in higher education led her to serve as Vice Chair of the Post-Secondary Education and Workforce Committee. On that committee, she collaborated with lawmakers to improve access to community and technical colleges, apprenticeships, and four-year institutions, preparing workers to meet future workforce needs.

Support Services and Advocacy :
Mari championed critical support services for foster care and homeless students. In her role in human services and as a former Trustee of the Accountable Communities of Health, she worked on programs focused on behavioral health, aging and long-term care, early learning, violence prevention, developmental disabilities for our youngest citizens, and affordable housing and homelessness. As a legislator, she continues to work on these issues as Vice Chair of the Housing Committee.

Mari Leavitt's advocacy extends to seniors, students, working families, veterans, military families, and people experiencing homelessness. Her commitment to public service and community well-being drives her legislative efforts, making her a dedicated representative for the people of Washington.
