Rep. April Connors, 8th District
Rep. April Connors represents the 8th District in Washington State. As a lifelong Tri-Citian, she brings a deep understanding of the community's needs and challenges. Let's delve into her background and priorities:

Background
April Connors holds a Bachelor of Arts in Communications from Washington State University. Her professional journey includes writing and maintaining city codes as a legal assistant, during which she was involved in a housing case brought to the U.S. Supreme Court. Her commitment to public service led her to the Washington House of Representatives, where she advocates for her constituents.
Priorities
1. Homeownership
April recognizes the urgent need for affordable housing in Washington. With the state having the fewest housing units per household in the nation, families face high costs and limited options. She champions commonsense, pro-housing policies to address this crisis.

2. Empowering Young Workers
April is passionate about empowering young people through education and employment. She understands the challenges faced by high school students seeking jobs in Washington. Her efforts focus on creating opportunities for young workers to thrive and contribute to the state's economy.

3. Meaningful Tax Relief
Groceries, housing, child care, and education costs have risen, impacting working families. April proposed the Carbon Auction Rebate (CAR) bill, which aimed to provide registered vehicle owners with a one-time payment. Despite grassroots support, the majority party did not give it a public hearing.
