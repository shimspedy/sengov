Sen. Claudia Kauffman, representing the 47th Legislative District in Washington, was sworn into the State Senate in January 2023. As a member of the Nez Perce tribe, she holds the distinction of being the only Indigenous woman to serve in the Senate.

Kauffman plays a vital role within the Senate Democratic Caucus. She serves as the Leadership Liaison to the Tribal Nations, demonstrating her commitment to advocating for Indigenous communities. Additionally, she holds the position of vice chair on the Senate Human Services Committee and is an active member of the Transportation and Local Government, Land Use & Tribal Affairs committees.

Her journey into politics began after working as a private consultant to the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. Co-founding the Native Action Network, Kauffman decided to run for the 47th District Senate seat, despite having no prior experience in elected office. Her dedication to protecting children, promoting equity, enhancing support services for people with disabilities, and improving public education in Washington continues to drive her legislative efforts.
