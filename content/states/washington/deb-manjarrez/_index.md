Deb Manjarrez, a member of the Republican Party, serves in the Washington House of Representatives. She represents District 14, having assumed office on January 13, 2025. Her current term is set to conclude on January 11, 2027.

Born and raised in Wapato, Washington, Deb Manjarrez has deep roots in her community. She is the fourth generation of her family to work in farming and, alongside her husband Mark, manages an apple orchard that has been in her family since the 1940s. Her upbringing in a farming community instilled in her a strong work ethic and a commitment to serving her neighbors.

Manjarrez graduated from Wapato High School and went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from Central Washington University. She is a certified public accountant and has been a senior partner in her accounting firm for over 25 years. Her professional experience has equipped her with a keen understanding of fiscal responsibility and economic development, which she brings to her role as a legislator.

Before entering state politics, Manjarrez was actively involved in her local community. She served as the president of the Wapato Chamber of Commerce for a decade, during which she played a pivotal role in fostering local business growth and community engagement. She also co-founded the Wapato Tamale Festival, a popular event that celebrates local culture and brings people together.

In her political career, Manjarrez has been a dedicated advocate for her constituents. She ran for office to fill the seat vacated by Gina Mosbrucker and won the election in 2024. Her campaign focused on issues such as supporting agriculture, promoting small businesses, and ensuring fiscal accountability. Her victory marked a significant milestone, as she became a voice for her district in the state legislature.

Manjarrez's personal life is deeply intertwined with her professional and political endeavors. She and her husband Mark have been married for 39 years and are proud parents of two daughters and grandparents to three grandchildren. Her family values and community ties continue to inspire her work in the Washington House of Representatives, where she remains committed to making a positive impact on the lives of her constituents.
