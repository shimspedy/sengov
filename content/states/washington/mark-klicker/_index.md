Mark Klicker is a native of Walla Walla, Washington. His family roots go as far back as 1861 when his ancestors pioneered the Walla Walla Valley. Mark grew up on the family farm where he followed in his ancestors’ footsteps, farming the land by growing irrigated crops, orchards, dryland wheat, cattle, and timber.

Family is an important part of Mark’s life. He has been married for 36 years, has three adult children and four grandchildren. Mark thoroughly enjoys spending time with his growing family.

Mark has farmed and worked in the agriculture industry for over 35 years. As a regional field director for the Washington Farm Bureau from 1997 until 2012, he worked with many farmers and ranchers throughout Eastern and Western Washington. Following his employment with the Farm Bureau, he pursued a career in selling farm and ranch real estate and continued to operate and manage family forest property in Washington and Oregon.

Mark also raised cherries on the lower Snake River from 1991 to 2015 until he sold the farm. He became the project coordinator for Monson Fruit Company on that same farm, converting it into a large irrigated cherry, apple, and cattle operation. He now owns and operates Urban, Farm and Forest Group, a timber and forest management company.

Mark continues to work with Northwest First Realtors where he uses his expertise in agriculture by selling irrigated farms, dryland ranches, rangeland, and forest properties.

He serves as the ranking member on the Housing Committee, and is also on the Postsecondary Education and Workforce and Transportation committees.

In the Legislature, Mark brings his mission of working with all to find common ground to help the 16th District and the entire state prosper. Mark wants all families in Washington to thrive. He believes this can be accomplished by reducing taxes and promoting and rewarding innovation.
