David Hackney is a Democratic member of the Washington House of Representatives, representing the 11th Legislative District. Elected in 2020, he assumed office on January 11, 2021. His commitment to public service and advocacy for social justice is deeply rooted in his family's history.

Early Life and Family Heritage :
David's paternal grandfather, George, was a Pullman Porter and a member of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Portersâ€”the first African-American union in the United States. Through the protection of his economic and civil rights by the union, George made an improbable journey from an impoverished agricultural worker to the Black middle class during the Great Depression. On the other side of his family, David's maternal grandfather, John, was a sharecropper who moved north during World War II as part of the Great Migration of African Americans fleeing the Jim Crow South. John later joined the United Automobile Workers union, where he worked diligently for 37 years, never missing a day of scheduled work.

Educational Journey :
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, David was the youngest of three siblings. His family frequently moved due to his father's job, which meant attending five different schools in three states by the time he entered college. Despite the challenges of frequent relocations, David's parents prioritized education. They moved to neighborhoods they could barely afford to ensure their children attended good schools. David's grades initially suffered, but his parents' unwavering support led him to excel in high school. He received scholarships and financial aid to attend Cornell University, where he graduated with 20 job offers.

Healthcare Crisis and Resilience :
During his senior year of college, David's family faced a healthcare crisis when his mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. His father's temporary layoff due to a corporate merger disrupted their health insurance coverage. When his father resumed work, the company denied health care benefits to David's mother because of her "pre-existing condition." David's sister dropped out of college to care for their mother, and the resulting healthcare costs strained the family financially. Fortunately, the university President provided David with a personal loan, allowing him to complete his senior year. He later paid back the loan in full.

Legal Career and Advocacy :
David's realization that he could positively impact people's lives through the law led him to attend Harvard Law School. He also earned a Master's degree in Public Administration from the JFK School of Government at Harvard. Before joining the Legislature, David spent 25 years as a practicing attorney, including work at the United Nations. His legal career focused on environmental protections and workers' rights. In 2019, Governor Inslee appointed him to the Washington State Human Rights Commission.

Legislative Priorities :
As a representative, David Hackney serves on the Capital Budget (vice chair), Public Safety, and Transportation Committees. His legislative priorities include:

1. Equitable Education : David advocates for quality education, drawing from his own experiences. He understands the importance of accessible and excellent schools for all students.

2. Healthcare Access : Having faced a healthcare crisis in his family, David works to improve access to affordable healthcare and protect individuals with pre-existing conditions.

3. Social Justice and Workers' Rights : His background in workers' rights informs his commitment to creating fair labor policies and advocating for marginalized communities.

4. Environmental Stewardship : David supports policies that protect the environment and address climate change.

David Hackney's dedication to justice, education, and community well-being continues to shape his legislative work in Washington State.
