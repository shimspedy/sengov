Senator Manka Dhingra, representing the 45th Legislative District (D-Redmond), brings a wealth of experience to her role in the Washington State Senate. As Deputy Majority Leader, she leads with a commitment to justice, behavioral health, and community welfare.

With two decades as a Senior Deputy Prosecuting Attorney at the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office, Manka has a deep understanding of criminal justice. She played a pivotal role in developing and overseeing programs like the Regional Mental Health Court, Veterans Court, and Community Assessment and Referral for Diversion. Her expertise extends to crisis intervention, where she trains law enforcement officers to respond effectively to people in crisis.

Manka's legislative impact is far-reaching. She was elected in November 2017, becoming the first Sikh state legislator in the nation. As chair of the Senate Law & Justice Committee, she has sponsored and passed legislation addressing domestic violence, firearm violence prevention, property tax relief, financial fraud prosecution, and evidence-based criminal justice reform.

Beyond her legal and legislative work, Manka is a community leader. She co-founded Chaya, an organization supporting South Asian survivors of domestic violence. She serves on the board of Hopelink, a nonprofit dedicated to ending poverty, and the Behavioral Health, Aging, and Disability Steering Committee of NASHP.

Manka's advocacy extends to behavioral health. She founded the Senate Behavioral Health Subcommittee, championing transformation and prevention in Washington's behavioral health system. Her commitment to expanding the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline ensures that those in need receive timely treatment.
