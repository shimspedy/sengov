Before her tenure in the state legislature, Lisa Parshley had an extensive career in veterinary medicine, specializing as a veterinary oncologist. She earned her Ph.D. in biochemistry from Oregon Health & Science University and completed post-doctoral studies at the University of Washington. In 2003, she became a certified Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and achieved board certification as a veterinary oncologist in 2008. Alongside her medical career, she also established herself as a small business owner.

Parshleyâ€™s political journey began with her election to the Olympia City Council in 2017, where she represented Position 5 starting January 1, 2018. During her time on the council, she chaired the Finance Committee and served on the Thurston County Human Rights Commission and the board of directors for the LOTT Clean Water Alliance. Her leadership extended to championing progressive policies, such as expanding Olympia's sanctuary city status to include reproductive rights and healthcare access. She also played a role in extending the city's camping ban, reflecting her commitment to addressing local challenges.

In 2024, Parshley announced her candidacy for the Washington House of Representatives, aiming to fill the seat vacated by Jessica Bateman. Her campaign focused on supporting the middle class, expanding affordable housing, and enhancing healthcare protections. With endorsements from prominent figures like Bateman and Olympia Mayor Dontae Payne, she secured a decisive victory in the general election.

As a legislator, Lisa Parshley continues to advocate for policies that prioritize community well-being, economic equity, and environmental sustainability. Her diverse background in science, business, and local governance equips her with a unique perspective to address the multifaceted needs of her constituents.
