Yasmin Ayesha Christopher Trudeau, born in 1983 or 1984, is an American lawyer and politician. She represents Washington's 27th Legislative District, which includes Tacoma, Ruston, Browns Point, Dash Point, and Fife. Senator Trudeau identifies as a mixed-race Bangali American, a woman of color, and is proud of her immigrant and American blended roots. She holds the distinction of being the first Muslim-American to serve in the Washington state Legislature and the first WA state legislator to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

Her journey to public service is shaped by her lived experiences. Despite growing up in poverty and navigating state systems like foster care and DSHS, she persevered. Her mother, who never had the opportunity to learn how to read or write, motivated Yasmin's path to college, even during her teenage years of homelessness. The support she received from her community during critical times, her mother's incredible grit, and her connection to her faith/values all fueled her career in public service.

Before her current role as a state Senator, Yasmin Trudeau served as the Legislative Director for Attorney General Bob Ferguson. Her advocacy efforts included requesting and passing legislation to prevent gun violence, stop overprescribing of opiates, increase use of prescription monitoring programs, and establish strong domestic worker protections. She also worked on legislation to prohibit youth solitary confinement, increase consumer and student loan protections, address unfair debt collection practices, and enhance the efficacy of the state's Medicaid Fraud Program.

As the Attorney General's Tribal Affairs Manager, she helped establish a more transparent and collaborative relationship between sovereign Tribal Governments and the State's attorneys. Prior to that, she served as Tribal Affairs Manager for Washington State and worked as Staff Counsel for the Senate Democratic Caucus, where she staffed committees related to agriculture, water, trade, economic development, and capital budget.

Senator Trudeau is a licensed attorney and currently resides in Central Tacoma with her husband, 5-year-old son, 2-year-old daughter, and their cat, Jinx.
