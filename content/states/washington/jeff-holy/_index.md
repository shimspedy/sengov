Jeff has lived in the Spokane area for over 35 years with his wife, Cindy, and their two children. He earned his bachelor’s degree at Washington State University after serving three years in the Army and later serving in the Army National Guard to pay for school. After graduation, Jeff began a 22-year career with the Spokane police department as an officer and detective. During this time, he attended Gonzaga University School of Law where he earned his Juris Doctorate and was admitted to the Washington State Bar. He has practiced law 30 years, offering free legal services to those less fortunate along the way.

Jeff has served his community through coaching Little League, the Catholic Parish Council and Spokane Deaf Services.

His experience as a law enforcement officer and as an attorney gives Jeff a unique perspective now as a legislator. He has served the 6th District in the Legislature since 2013 and has been an active voice on public safety issues. He currently serves on the Joint Higher Education Committee, Advisory Committee on Advanced Tuition Payment, Washington State Gambling Commission and Board for Judicial Administration: Court Security Task Force. He also serves on the board of directors for LEOFF II, the retirement plan for Washington state law enforcement officers and firefighters. The plan administers $13 billion in benefits for 17,000 members and is the best funded active state pension system in the country.

With two children having graduated college in the last 10 years, Jeff understands the burden of higher education costs on families and students, and is committed to making higher education attainable for more people.

Jeff’s top priority is economic growth, especially for the Spokane area. He believes the Inland Northwest has enormous potential with its current and growing agriculture and manufacturing sectors combined with possibilities for infrastructure. Jeff sees more jobs as the answer to the poverty seen all too often in the Inland Northwest.

Other legislative priorities for Jeff include targeted investments in education and higher education, upholding the state and national constitutions and responsibly balancing the state budget with a small, efficient government.

Jeff serves as the ranking member on the Senate Higher Education and Workforce Development Committee, and serves on the Health and Long Term Care Committee, and Transportation Committee.
