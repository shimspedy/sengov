Born and raised in the 34th Legislative District, **Sen. Joe Nguyễn** has deep roots in the community. His experiences and involvement with the community make him an ardent champion for investing in Washington families and residents, expanding economic opportunities, and marking him as a bold leader in our fight against the climate crisis.

Joe is the Chair of the Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. He also serves as the Vice Chair of the budget-writing Ways & Means Committee and sits on the Human Services Committee. Elected to the Senate in 2019, he has spent his tenure advocating for working families and community members who historically have been left out of the political process.

Throughout his first term, Joe prioritized increased funding for social services. He championed legislation to modernize and increase access to basic needs programs, such as raising funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. He also helped make historic investments in affordable housing and alleviating the homelessness crisis.

Joe has been a staunch leader in reforming the criminal justice system. For example, legislation he championed expunged cannabis-related misdemeanors, addressing the disproportionately higher rates at which BIPOC and lower-income communities have been prosecuted.

Recognizing the talent and potential of Washington’s students, Joe sponsored legislation to allow Community and Technical Colleges to offer four-year computer science degrees. This work has allowed Washington students, particularly students of color and low-income students, to access opportunities in a rapidly growing and competitive computer science industry.

Joe resides in West Seattle with his family, and he continues to fight for a better future by advocating for justice, equity, and environmental sustainability.
