Shaun Scott is a member of the Democratic Party, serving in the Washington House of Representatives. He represents District 43, having assumed office on January 13, 2025. His current term is set to end on January 11, 2027.

Shaun Scott's journey into politics is deeply rooted in his passion for social justice and community advocacy. Born on November 8, 1984, in Queens, New York, Shaun moved to Seattle at a young age, where he developed a strong connection to the city and its people. He pursued his education at the University of Washington, earning a degree in history, which laid the foundation for his understanding of societal structures and the importance of equitable policies.

Before entering the legislature, Shaun had a diverse career as a filmmaker, union organizer, and author. His creative works often explored themes of social and economic inequality, reflecting his commitment to addressing systemic issues. As a union organizer, he played a pivotal role in advocating for workers' rights and fair labor practices, further solidifying his reputation as a dedicated advocate for the underrepresented.

In addition to his legislative duties, Shaun serves as the Vice Chair of the Labor & Workplace Standards Committee and is a member of the House Education and Finance Committees. His legislative priorities include promoting affordable housing, advancing environmental sustainability through a Green New Deal, and improving public transportation infrastructure. Shaun's progressive agenda is driven by his belief in redistributive policies that ensure a fairer distribution of resources and opportunities.

Shaun Scott is also a member of the Seattle Democratic Socialists of America, making history as the first socialist elected to the Washington State Legislature since 1912. His dedication to progressive values and his ability to connect with constituents have made him a prominent figure in Washington politics. Outside of his political career, Shaun continues to engage with his community, drawing inspiration from the resilience and diversity of the people he represents.
