Rep. Julio Cortes, a native of Mexico City, immigrated to Washington with his family at the age of five. Raised by hardworking parents employed in the fields and fruit warehouses, Cortes overcame challenges to graduate from Wapato High School and commenced his college journey at Walla Walla Community College. Eventually, he earned his four-year degree from Western Washington University. 

Following his college years, Rep. Cortes dedicated almost a decade of his life to working at Oasis Teen Shelter and Cocoon House, directly assisting at-risk and homeless youth along with their families. More recently, he has been contributing to the City of Everett as the Economic Development and Marketing Manager, with a focus on economic equity and expansion, particularly serving as the liaison for small and medium-sized businesses and aerospace. 

These diverse experiences have shaped Rep. Cortesâ€™s belief that communities flourish when adequately resourced and when individuals with varied lived experiences are empowered to contribute. His key priorities involve addressing the root causes of homelessness, promoting the development of affordable housing throughout Washington, supporting small businesses in Snohomish County, empowering immigrant communities, and tackling the climate crisis. 

Rep. Cortes actively participates in the Washington State Latino Democratic Caucus, working to uplift and address issues impacting overburdened communities across the state. His committee assignments include serving as the Vice Chair for Human Services, Youth, & Early Learning, as well as contributing to committees on Innovation, Community & Economic Development, and Veterans and Transportation. 

Residing in Everett with his wife, two dogs, and four chickens, Rep. Cortes remains committed to making a positive impact on the lives of those he serves.
