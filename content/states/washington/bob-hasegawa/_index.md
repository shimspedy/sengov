Bob Hasegawa is a lifelong resident of the 11th Legislative District. He grew up on Beacon Hill in Seattle and attended Cleveland High School. Over the years, Bob has lived in various areas, including Riverton Heights in Tukwila and Maplewood Heights in Renton.

Bob's background is deeply rooted in labor and social justice activism. For 32 years, he was a member of the Teamsters Union, rising to become the elected leader of Teamsters Local 174â€”the largest Teamster trucking industry and general workers local union in the Pacific Northwest. He was also involved in Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), a national pro-union democracy reform movement.

As a union and community organizer, Bob has worked to build bridges between social justice organizations, particularly those serving labor, environmental, religious, and communities of color. He co-founded the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance (APALA) and served on its local and national executive boards. Additionally, he has been part of the Martin Luther King County Central Labor Council and the Washington State Labor Council.

Bob's commitment to lifelong learning led him to study physics at the University of Washington, earn an AA degree in labor studies from Shoreline Community College, and explore information technology at Seattle Central Community College. He is a seasoned professional commercial truck driver, certified transit operator, and journey-level operating engineer (heavy construction equipment operator). He later graduated from Antioch University Seattle with dual concentrations in Labor Relations and Organizational and Social Change. Bob also holds a Master of Public Administration degree from the Dan Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington.

Since 2005, Bob has represented the 11th Legislative District, first in the House of Representatives and later in the Senate. His priorities have consistently centered on working families, small businesses, and disenfranchised communities. Currently, he serves as the Chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus (Majority Caucus) and holds various committee assignments, including Rules, Ways & Means, State Government and Elections, and Business, Financial Services, Gaming & Trade.

Bob Hasegawa's dedication to economic and social justice continues to shape his legislative work, making him a strong advocate for the people of Washington State.
