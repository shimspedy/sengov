Liz Lovelett is an involved, dedicated, pragmatic leader in the 40th Legislative District who takes a holistic, systems approach to problem-solving. As a fifth-generation Fidalgo Island resident, Liz is rooted and invested in her community. Her father worked as a fisherman and later retired from the local refinery.

Senator Lovelett represents the 40th Legislative District in northern Puget Sound, including San Juan and portions of Whatcom and Skagit Counties. She was appointed to the Senate in 2019, won a special election that fall, and was re-elected in 2020. Liz is known throughout the region as a champion for our environment, housing, water management, refinery safety, and for looking for solutions to common issues that improve people’s lives and repair past harms.

She served on the Anacortes City Council and has been a board member for several organizations, including Population Health Trust Skagit County. Liz fosters working relationships between state government and the people she serves. Her goals include promoting environmental stewardship, balancing community growth and economic vitality, supporting rural issues, and finding solutions that put people first.

Senator Lovelett is the Vice Chair of the Environment, Energy & Technology Committee and serves on both the Housing & Local Government and Transportation Committees. She co-founded the Ferry Legislator Caucus to advocate for much-needed funding and improvements in service. Additionally, she was appointed to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC), both of which are bicameral and bipartisan.

Her expertise and collaboration have resulted in the passage of legislation to set guidelines for boaters to protect Washington’s Southern Resident Killer Whales, promote energy efficiency improvements in commercial buildings, expand access to safe and affordable housing for farmworkers, and increase access to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, among other accomplishments.

Liz Lovelett is not only a dedicated public servant but also a mother, sister, and daughter of Anacortes residents. She has owned and operated a business and enjoys spending time with her kids, hiking, and singing in her local band.
