State Representative Darya Farivar was born and raised in the 46th Legislative District in the Lake City neighborhood. Being from this community means she understand the unique issues our community is facing today including housing availability and affordability, access to behavioral health services and community safety. Rep. Farivar is deeply committed to lifting all voices and co-governance. Darya wants our community to thrive and grow in today’s economy and for all community members to be safe and stably housed. Rep. Farivar was drawn to public service because she believes we are stronger when we work together – and she is excited to get to work with big, bold, ideas for creative solutions and more. 

Before coming to the legislature, Rep. Farivar worked in disability rights advocacy focused on the intersection of behavioral health, housing and the criminal legal system. Prior to that, she worked to support immigrants and refugees with developmental disabilities. Her advocacy work has always aimed to center the voices and lived experiences of people who are directly impacted. 

Rep. Farivar graduated from the University of Redlands with a B.A. in Communicative Disorders and a minor in Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies. She spent time volunteering in the juvenile justice system and founded the university’s first Middle Eastern Student Association.

Farivar is very proud of her ethnic heritage and is excited to lead as the first Middle Eastern woman and first Iranian American woman elected to the Washington State Legislature. Farivar is also the youngest person to be elected to serve the 46th legislative district. In her free time, she serves as board member of the Washington Coalition for Police Accountability, enjoys cooking, gardening and spending time with her rescue pup, Dragon.
