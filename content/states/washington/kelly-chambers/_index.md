Rep. Kelly Chambers is serving her third term representing the 25th Legislative District. She is a lifelong resident of Pierce County and a graduate of Pacific Lutheran University, where she received a B.A. in Political Science and a B.A.E. in Secondary Education.

She currently serves as the ranking Republican member of the House Regulated Substances and Gaming Committee, which considers issues relating to the regulation and taxation of alcohol, tobacco, vapor products and cannabis, as well as product safety and access, and issues relating to the regulation and oversight of gaming, including tribal compacts.

She also serves as the assistant ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, which considers the operating budget and fiscal issues such as pension policy and compensation.

In addition to these committees, she is also a member of the House Innovation, Community and Economic Development, and Veterans Committee, which considers issues relating to community development; community investment programs; underrepresented communities; and veterans’ and military affairs.

One of Kelly’s top priorities is strengthening Washington state’s education system so every child has the opportunity to receive a quality education. A former school teacher herself, Kelly credits the teachers she had growing up for encouraging her to pursue her dreams and says they are a big reason why she was able to become the first member of her family to go to college, start a business, and run for elected office.

Another of Kelly’s priorities is crafting and supporting policies that create jobs and ease burdens on small business owners in the 25th District and around the state. She and her husband, Jeff, operate a business that employs hundreds and provides vital in-home support for seniors and members of the disabled community.

Finally, Kelly is committed to fighting for lower property taxes and looking for ways to relieve congestion and ease the financial burden on commuters.

In her community, Kelly has served as president of the Health Care Providers Council of Pierce County. She currently serves on the board of Puget Sound Honor Flights, a nonprofit organization that transports Western Washington veterans to Washington D.C. to visit and reflect at memorials dedicated to honor their service and sacrifices.

Kelly and Jeff have three grown children, Ashton, Savanna, and Nick. She also recently welcomed her first grandchild.
