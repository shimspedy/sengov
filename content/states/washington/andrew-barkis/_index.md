Andrew K. Barkis (born 1968) is a Republican member of the Washington House of Representatives, representing the 2nd district. His journey in public service began when he was appointed by the Thurston County Commission in February 2016 to succeed fellow Republican Graham Hunt, who had resigned. Since then, Barkis has been a tireless advocate for his constituents and has championed various issues.

Here's a more detailed biography of Representative Andrew Barkis:

Andrew Barkis was born and raised in Chehalis, Washington. He attended Centralia College, where he earned an Associate of Arts degree, and later graduated from Seattle University with a Bachelor of Arts degree. His educational background laid the foundation for his commitment to public service.

As a property manager and politician, Barkis brings a unique perspective to the Legislature. He serves as the ranking minority member on the Community Development, Housing & Tribal Affairs Committee, where he actively contributes to shaping policies related to housing, development, and tribal affairs. Additionally, he is a member of the House Consumer Protection & Business Committee, where he focuses on consumer rights and business regulations.

Barkis's legislative work extends beyond committee assignments. In 2024, he took the lead as the sponsor of state legislation that allows residential property owners to split their lots into smaller parcels. This initiative aims to provide homeowners with more flexibility and options for land use.

Outside of his legislative duties, Barkis resides in Lacey, Washington, with his wife, Lisa. They have two children. His commitment to public service, dedication to his constituents, and passion for improving Washington State continue to define his tenure in the House of Representatives.
