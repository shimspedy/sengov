Jim Walsh was elected to the state House of Representatives in 2016 and officially took office on December 8 of that same year. He proudly represents the 19th District, encompassing portions of Cowlitz, Grays Harbor, Lewis, Pacific, Thurston, and Wahkiakum counties. Remarkably, Jim is only the third Republican to represent the district since the 1940s.

His legislative focus revolves around critical issues such as fostering family-wage job creation, ensuring adequate funding for schools, and safeguarding the interests of taxpayers, property rights, and gun rights. Jim is particularly dedicated to diversifying the economies of the coastal communities within his district, striving to introduce new opportunities for his constituents. Recognizing the importance of an effective local school system, he believes it plays a vital role in securing a comprehensive economic recovery.

Jim is committed to bipartisan collaboration and seeks common-sense solutions in the Legislature. Serving on four House committees, he holds a significant role as the ranking member of the House Civil Rights and Judiciary Committee. Additionally, Jim is a member of the Human Services, Youth and Early Learning, Rules, and Transportation committees.

A cum laude graduate of Amherst College in 1986, Jim founded a small publishing company in 1998 that he manages to this day. Beyond his legislative duties, he has contributed columns to the Aberdeen Daily World newspaper, coached both boys’ and girls’ basketball teams, and assumed leadership roles within local and state Republican groups.

Residing in Aberdeen, Jim is a proud parent of five children.
