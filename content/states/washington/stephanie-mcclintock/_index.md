Stephanie is dedicated to her community, which is why she chose to become a State Representative in the 18th Legislative District. Making Washington a better place to live and raise a family is high on her priority list.

Additionally, as a former school board member, she wants technical and trades programs to be more available, especially in high school, to give young people another path after graduation.

During her time on the Battle Ground School Board from 2013 until 2017, Stephanie learned the complexities involved with all school districts and was a champion for increasing parental involvement within those complex decisions.

Public safety and effective policing standards are also a high priority. Stephanieâ€™s father served for 31 years as a police detective, so she understands the importance of public safety, especially in the face of rising crime. She is committed to supporting our first responders who selflessly risk their lives to keep us safe. She strongly supports funding our law enforcement and enforcing our laws.

In the Legislature, Stephanie serves on House Capital Budget, Consumer Protection & Business, and Education committees. Stephanie received her Bachelor of Arts in Business Management from Concordia University and currently works in public relations for United Grain Corporation.

In her free time, Stephanie enjoys giving back to her community and has been involved in many organizations, including volunteering with Prairie High School Boosters and Battle Ground Education Foundation. Stephanie and her husband, along with their two sons, proudly call Vancouver, Washington their home.
