Senator John Lovick, representing the 44th Legislative District (D-Mill Creek), has dedicated his life to public service. His diverse background includes 31 years as a State Trooper, where he was named Trooper of the Year in 1992. Additionally, he served 13 years in the United States Coast Guard, patrolling the waters off Alaska.

John's political journey began when he was elected to the Mill Creek City Council in 1993, where he later served as Mayor Pro Tem. In 1998, he was elected to the House of Representatives, where he spent nine years, including five as Speaker Pro Tem. During his time in the House, John sponsored the Primary Seat Belt Law, significantly increasing seat belt usage from 81% to 97%. He also championed legislation to create the Auto Theft Prevention Authority, helping reduce car thefts in Washington State.

In 2007, John was elected Snohomish County Sheriff, and from 2013 to 2015, he served as Snohomish County Executive. In June 2016, he was appointed to the House of Representatives to fill the vacated seat of Rep. Hans Dunshee and won re-election in November 2016. In December 2021, John was selected to fill the vacancy left when Steve Hobbs was appointed Secretary of State.

A long-time resident of Mill Creek, John remains actively engaged in his community. He volunteers regularly at the elementary school his children attended and is known for his famous "John Lovick's Deep-Fried Turkeys," which he cooks for charity events.
