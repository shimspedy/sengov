Janice Zahn is a Democratic Party member serving in the Washington House of Representatives. She represents District 41, Position 1, and assumed office on January 21, 2025. Her current term is set to end on January 12, 2026.

Janice Zahn has a rich and diverse background that has shaped her career in public service. Born in Hong Kong, she immigrated to the United States with her family at the age of ten. Her academic journey led her to the University of Washington, where she earned three degrees: a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, a Master of Science in Structural Engineering and Mechanics, and a Master of Public Administration. These qualifications laid the foundation for her professional and political endeavors.

Before her appointment to the Washington House of Representatives, Zahn had an extensive career at the Port of Seattle, where she held various roles, eventually becoming the Chief Engineer in 2022. Her expertise in engineering and public administration has been instrumental in her approach to governance and policy-making. In addition to her professional achievements, she served on the Bellevue City Council, where she was elected in November 2017. Her tenure on the council allowed her to address local issues and advocate for her community effectively.

Zahn's commitment to public service is deeply rooted in her personal experiences as an immigrant and a long-time resident of Bellevue, Washington. She has lived in the area for over 30 years, raising her two daughters with her husband, Dwain Zahn, whom she married in 1989. Her dedication to her community is evident in her active participation in local initiatives and her role as a legislator.

As a member of the Washington House of Representatives, Zahn serves on several committees, including Transportation, Capital Budget, Housing, and Local Government. Her work focuses on addressing critical issues such as infrastructure development, affordable housing, and sustainable urban planning. Zahn's leadership and vision continue to make a significant impact on her district and the state of Washington.
