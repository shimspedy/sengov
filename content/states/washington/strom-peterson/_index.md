Strom Howard Peterson, born in 1967 or 1968, represents the 21st Legislative District in Washington State. His district includes neighborhoods in Edmonds, Everett, Lynnwood, and Mukilteo. Strom began his first term in Olympia in January 2015.

As a legislator, Strom serves as the Chair of the Housing Committee and is a member of the Capital Budget and Civil Rights & Judiciary Committees. His commitment to community development and environmental protection stems from his experience as a small business owner. Before joining the legislature, Strom owned the Cheesemonger’s Table, a cheese shop and café in Edmonds. Through this venture, he witnessed firsthand the positive impact of living wages and smart infrastructure investments on a community.

Prior to his legislative role, Strom served on the Edmonds City Council for six years. During his tenure, he demonstrated capable and thoughtful leadership, particularly in areas related to public safety and economic development.

Strom's advocacy extends beyond politics. He actively supports and volunteers for various community organizations, including the Edmonds Center for the Arts, local Rotary clubs, the Chamber Board, the Edmonds Community College Boots to Books program, and the Edmonds Veteran’s Plaza.

Originally from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Strom received his B.A. in English from the University of New Mexico. Since 2001, he has called Edmonds home, where he resides with his wife, Maria Montalvo, and their dog, Lulu.

In September 2022, Strom Peterson was appointed to serve on the Snohomish County Council, further contributing to the betterment of his community.
