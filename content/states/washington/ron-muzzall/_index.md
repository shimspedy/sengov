Ronald Edwin Muzzall is an American politician from Washington. He has served as a Republican member of the Washington State Senate since October 18, 2019. Muzzall was appointed unanimously to replace Barbara Bailey by the Skagit County Commissioners, Island County Commissioners, and Snohomish County Council.

Born in 1963, Muzzall is a fourth-generation resident of Whidbey Island. After graduating from Washington State University (the third generation in his family to do so), he returned to the 10th legislative district to farm with his wife, Shelly.

As a legislator, Muzzall has been active in various roles. He currently serves as the vice-chair of the caucus, presiding over internal meetings and coordinating committee activities. Before this, he was the deputy whip for the Senate Republicans.

Muzzall's commitment to public service and his background as a farmer contribute to his work in the Washington State Senate. His term is set to end on January 13, 2025.
