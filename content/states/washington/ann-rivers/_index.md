Anna M. Rivers (born 1965 or 1966) is an American politician and educator. She has served as a Republican member of the Washington State Senate since her appointment in 2012, following the resignation of Joe Zarelli. Prior to her Senate tenure, Rivers was a member of the Washington House of Representatives.

In her first full term as a senator, a Majority Coalition Caucus was formed, shifting control away from the Democrats in the state senate. Rivers was appointed as the majority whip for the session, a rare honor for a freshman senator. She secured re-election for another four-year term in 2012, winning 67% of the vote against her opponent, Ralph Schmidt.

Before holding elected office, Rivers led AMR Consulting, a political consulting firm that assisted candidates in their election campaigns and provided political consultation to corporate clients. In 2007, she was considered as a replacement for Representative Richard Curtis in the state house, but Jaime Herrera Beutler was ultimately chosen.

Early in her career, Rivers worked as a 6th-grade teacher after earning a bachelor's degree in political science from Central Michigan University. Later, she returned to school, obtaining a secondary teaching certificate from Lewis and Clark College in 2002.

Rivers' dedication to public service and her background in education and consulting have shaped her legislative career. Her decision not to seek another term in the state Senate was influenced by increased responsibilities as an assistant city manager in Longview and a desire to spend more time with her family.
