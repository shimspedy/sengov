Deborah Krishnadasan is a Democratic member of the Washington State Senate, representing the 26th District. She assumed office on December 11, 2024, following her appointment by the Kitsap County Board of Commissioners and the Pierce County Council. Her current term is set to end on January 12, 2026.

Born and raised in Puyallup, Washington, Deborah grew up in a union household on a farm, where she learned the values of hard work and community. She became the first in her family to graduate from college, earning a Bachelor of Arts in Communications from Western Washington University. Her professional career spans roles in communications and human resources for organizations such as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and major corporations like Microsoft.

Deborah's dedication to education and public service became evident when she moved to Gig Harbor with her husband, Baiya, a cardiothoracic surgeon, and their three children. She became deeply involved in the local school system, serving two terms on the Peninsula School Board and eventually becoming its president. During her tenure, she spearheaded initiatives that led to the successful passage of levies and bonds, enabling the construction of new schools and the modernization of existing ones. Her efforts earned her recognition, including the Gig Harbor Chamber of Commerceâ€™s Citizen of the Year award in 2023.

In the Washington State Senate, Deborah serves on several key committees, including Early Learning & K-12 Education, Transportation, and Agriculture & Natural Resources. She is also the vice chair of the State Government, Tribal Affairs & Elections Committee. Her legislative priorities include improving educational opportunities, advancing public transportation and infrastructure, and fostering an inclusive economy that benefits all Washingtonians.

Deborah continues to reside in Gig Harbor with her family, where she remains an active member of the community. Her journey from a farm in Puyallup to the state senate exemplifies her commitment to service and her belief in the power of collective action to create meaningful change.
