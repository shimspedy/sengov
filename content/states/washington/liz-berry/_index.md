State Representative Liz Berry represents Washington’s 36th Legislative District, located in the shadow of the Space Needle. It includes the Seattle neighborhoods of Queen Anne, Magnolia, Interbay, Ballard, Phinney Ridge, Crown Hill, and Greenwood.

Liz is Chair of the Labor & Workplace Standards Committee and is a member of the Environment & Energy and Transportation committees, where she is a passionate advocate for working families, combating climate change, and building vital infrastructure that is safe, equitable, and green. She also serves on the Legislative Committee on Economic Development and International Relations and as a Board Trustee of ArtsFund.

Liz previously led the region’s largest civil justice advocacy organization dedicated to standing up for the legal rights of patients, consumers and injured workers. A lifelong champion for women in leadership and reproductive justice, Liz served as president of the National Women’s Political Caucus of Washington and as a board member for Pro-Choice Washington.

Liz earned her B.A. in Communications, Law, Economics, and Government from American University in Washington, DC, and interned abroad for the U.S. Embassy in Brussels. She has continued studies at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, Executive Education.

For four years, Liz worked for U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, lastly as her Legislative Director. On Jan. 8, 2011, the nation watched in horror as a gunman attacked Rep. Giffords’ constituent event, killing six people, including a young girl. Liz also lost her friend and colleague, Gabe Zimmerman. Gabe is the first congressional staffer to be killed in the line of duty. This experience touched Liz in a profound way and has inspired her to tackle the tragedy of gun violence in our communities.

Liz lives with her husband Michael, a small business owner, and their two children in Queen Anne. As proud mom to George, 8, and Eleanor, 4 Liz is focused on uplifting families and children who rely on access to affordable childcare and a world-class public education system. She is honored to represent the progressive values of Washington’s 36th District in Olympia.
