Rep. Eric Robertson was raised in Buckley. He attended the White River Schools from kindergarten through his high school graduation and attended Green River Community College and City University. He started his career with the Washington State Patrol in 1983.

Eric is no stranger to public service. He was first elected to the state House of Representatives to represent the 31st District in 1994. During this time in the Legislature, he was appointed assistant majority whip during his first term and elected the majority caucus chairman during his second term. He served on the Transportation, Judiciary, Agriculture and Ecology, and Rules committees. He was a champion for government accountability, reform, and lower taxes. He still holds these ideals and values as he continues this next chapter as a state representative.

In 1998, Eric left the Legislature returning to serve the citizens of Washington state full-time with the Washington State Patrol, achieving the rank of Captain. He was the director of Government & Media Relations and commander of the Office of Professional Standards. In 1999, he graduated from the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) National Academy in Quantico, VA. In 2002, President George W. Bush appointed him the United States Marshal for Western Washington. He was responsible for federal courthouse and judicial security and law enforcement teams for bringing fugitives and sex offenders to justice.

After serving as a U.S. Marshal, Eric led the team which formed the first regional fire authority in the state as the administrator. They created a model for regionalizing the stateâ€™s fire, emergency, and rescue services.  He was also an active member and chairman of the legislative committee of the Washington Fire Chiefs Association, promoting statewide public policy for the regionalization of fire services and fire/EMS safety issues.

Eric is currently serving as the ranking member of the Consumer Protection and Business Committee, the assistant ranking member of the Transportation Committee, and the assistant ranking member of the Regulated Substances and Gaming Committee.

Throughout his life and career, he has proudly served his communities in law enforcement, the Legislature, and various service organizations. He lives in Sumner, is the proud father of five, and enjoys his nine grandchildren.
