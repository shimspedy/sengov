Senator Jamie Pedersen, representing the 43rd Legislative District (D-Seattle), has a rich and diverse background. He grew up in Puyallup, Washington, and graduated from Puyallup High School. To put himself through Yale College, he worked at McDonald's while studying Russian and history. His dedication paid off, as he graduated summa cum laude.

After completing his undergraduate studies, Jamie spent a year living in Russia, where he collected oral histories from Soviet Afghan war veterans. His passion for justice and advocacy led him to Yale Law School, where he honed his legal skills.

Jamie's professional journey took him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where he clerked. He then returned to Seattle, specifically Capitol Hill, in 1995. For 17 years, he practiced corporate law at Preston Gates & Ellis (now K&L Gates). In 2012, he joined McKinstry, a Seattle-based construction and engineering firm known for its expertise in green building. At McKinstry, Jamie serves as the Executive Vice President and General Counsel.

His political career began when he was elected to the Washington House of Representatives in 2006. Later, in December 2013, he was appointed to the Senate, where he has been re-elected in 2014 and 2018. Jamie's leadership shines through his four-year tenure as chair of the Senate Law & Justice Committee. In December 2021, he was elected Majority Floor Leader, further solidifying his impact.

Beyond legislative duties, Jamie remains committed to community service. He serves on the Legislative Ethics Board and the Office of Public Defense Oversight Committee. Additionally, he is a commissioner in the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws.

Jamie's involvement extends to nonprofit organizations. He played a pivotal role in organizing and being a plaintiff in League of Education Voters v. State of Washington, a case that overturned several Tim Eyman initiatives related to tax increases. He also chaired the board of the national civil rights organization Lambda Legal and provided pro bono legal services to various nonprofits.

As a devoted family man, Jamie lives on Capitol Hill with his husband, Eric Pedersen, and their sons Trygve, Leif, Erik, and Anders. All of them attend Seattle Public Schools. Jamie's commitment to public service, legal advocacy, and community welfare continues to shape Washington State's legislative landscape.
