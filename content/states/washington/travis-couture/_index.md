A U.S. Navy Veteran, Rep. Travis Couture understands what service and sacrifice mean. He patrolled the Pacific as a submariner while stationed with Ballistic Missile Submarines USS Alabama and USS Nebraska, successfully completing multiple strategic deterrence patrols. He was honorably discharged in 2011, having earned numerous honors and awards for his service.

Following his military service, Travis worked as a Program Manager for a Fortune 500 company overseeing billions of dollars in assets and assisting the U.S. Navy with protecting the nation at Naval Base Kitsap. Later, he led over 100 employees as the Director of Operations of a non-profit serving people with disabilities in Kitsap County.

Travis earned his Master’s Degree in Business Administration and Bachelor’s Degree in Organizational Leadership from Brandman University.

With over a decade of community involvement in the 35th Legislative District, Travis is a trusted leader.

As a father of four, Travis understands the challenges facing Washington families – from the high cost of gas and groceries to making sure his kids receive a quality public education. His desire to make a difference in their future largely inspired him to become a state representative.

Travis and his wife, Julie, live in Allyn with their four children.
