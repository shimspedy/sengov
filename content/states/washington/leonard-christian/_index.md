Leonard Christian is a Republican member of the Washington State Senate, representing the 4th Legislative District. He assumed office on January 13, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 8, 2029.

Born on September 22, 1965, in Los Angeles, California, Leonard Christian grew up in Spokane, Washington, where he graduated from Joel E. Ferris High School. He went on to earn an Associate degree from the Community College of the Air Force, a Bachelor of Science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and an MBA from Webster University. His early career was marked by two decades of service in the United States Air Force, where he retired as a Master Sergeant in 2005. During his military tenure, he served as an aircraft mechanic, shop chief, recruiter, and security manager.

After retiring from the Air Force, Christian transitioned to a career in real estate in Spokane Valley, Washington. His dedication to public service led him to politics, where he was first appointed to the Washington House of Representatives in 2014 to fill a vacancy. He later won elections to the House in 2022, serving until 2025. In 2024, he successfully ran for the Washington State Senate, continuing his commitment to representing the interests of his constituents in the 4th District.

Throughout his career, Leonard Christian has been actively involved in his community. He has served on the Spokane County GOP board as a district leader and volunteered as a search and rescue pilot for the Civil Air Patrol. He has also taught aircraft mechanics at Moody Bible Institute in Spokane. In his personal life, Christian enjoys flying and spending time with his wife, Rima, whom he married shortly after high school. Together, they have two children and three grandchildren.

Christian's legislative priorities include supporting veterans, fostering economic development, and improving healthcare access. His leadership and dedication to public service have earned him recognition and respect within his community and beyond.
