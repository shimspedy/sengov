Mary Dye has lived in the 9th District most of her life, where she operates a 3,000-acre wheat farm with her husband, Roger. The Dyes pride themselves on creativity and innovation in agronomic practices and advancing new technologies that improve efficiencies and cost savings for the agricultural community.

Rep. Dye serves as the ranking member on the House Environment and Energy Committee where significant and consequential economic policy has been considered. From the Clean Energy Transformation Act, the Climate Commitment Act and Move Ahead Washington, our state has sought to establish leadership in the nation’s move to transform our economic system. By monetizing carbon emissions and increasing the cost of energy, the new climate laws intend to reduce demand for petroleum while funding projects not directly related to climate impacts. Urban majorities support utilizing the wealth and capacity of our energy and manufacturing sector to transform to a petroleum free economy by 2050.

However, Dye believes the consequences of inflating the cost of energy will result in no real solutions. In contrast, Dye has produced a viable alternative along with a menu of practical environmental solutions to the consequences of urban densification, what Dye refers to as Deep Urbanization. The way our urban dwellers experience climate is directly related to the more obvious problems with the built space on large landscapes where the function of the natural ecosystems is severely interrupted.

Dye is convinced that specific investments can have visible and palpable improvements in the quality of life for those living in urban spaces.  She postulates that creating more environmentally sustainable cities and restoring their ecological health will require the strength of healthy energy, manufacturing and natural resource economies across the state. She wants to invest in the environment of the city, and she is also deeply committed to restoring the infrastructure needed to sustain the natural resource economies in rural communities. She sees a unifying win-win path that can bring us back together.

Mary graduated in 2018 from the Pacific NorthWest Economic Region (PNWER) Foundation’s Legislative Energy Horizon Institute, which educates state legislators on the North American energy infrastructure and delivery system. She has also served on the National Conference of State Legislature’s (NCSL) Communications, Financial Services and Interstate Commerce Committee. She has a Bachelor of Science degree in plant science and crop management from the University of Idaho and has served as an agriculture educator for the Peace Corps in Thailand.

She is a vocal advocate for limited, but effective government, and believes state agencies at every level need to work more efficiently and effectively for all Washingtonians.
