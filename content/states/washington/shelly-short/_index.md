Shelly Short serves as the senator for Washington's 7th Legislative District. Representing a region rich in natural beauty, comprising mountains, forests, farms, orchards, lakes, and rivers, she highlights the unique challenges and values of this largely rural area. The district spans a fifth of the state, presenting issues distinct from those in urban areas like Seattle. Residents cherish their rural lifestyle and the freedoms it offers, focusing on economic growth, affordable living, enhanced rural services, and increased employment and recreational opportunities. Shelly emphasizes that the needs of her district often differ from urban priorities and that Olympia must recognize these differences.

Since 2009, Shelly has been a dedicated advocate for her district in the state Senate. In her role as Republican floor leader, she influences key debates on issues such as water, taxation, health care, education, and affordable energy. She values the opinions of her constituents in North Central and Northeastern Washington and invites them to share their thoughts on state government matters.

For any comments on state governance or assistance with state agencies, constituents can reach Shelly and her executive assistant, Shannon Whitmore, at (360) 786-7612, via email at Shelly.Short@leg.wa.gov, or by mail. Shelly and her team are committed to serving the district and prioritize this responsibility.
