Rep. Ed Orcutt was appointed to the Washington State House of Representatives in 2002. From 2002 to 2013, he represented the 18th District. Due to redistricting, Ed went on to represent the 20th District and is serving his twelfth term as state representative.

Focused on creating jobs and protecting taxpayers, Ed is an advocate for policies that benefit families and communities. He is also a strong voice for a more effective and accountable state government that works for – not against – property owners and employers.

Ed is the ranking member on the House Finance Committee, which considers issues relating to state and local revenues. He is also a member of the state Economic and Revenue Forecast Council. Ed believes our state tax system produces enough revenue to pay for state priorities, and state lawmakers should resist efforts to raise taxes on individuals, families, or employers.

Ed is also a leader on transportation issues, having served as ranking member on the House Transportation Committee from 2013 to 2018. He continues to serve on the committee where he advocates for local transportation solutions and the effective use of state gas-tax revenue. Ed also serves on the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee where he relies on his forestry background to advocate for sound forest policy. He also serves on Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee which oversees how state government operates.

Ed received an Associate of Science Degree in Forest Management from the University of Maine. He then went on to earn a Bachelor of Science Degree in Forest Management from the University of Idaho. Ed has been a forestry consultant since 1990. In 2009, he became the owner of his own consulting company.

An advocate for protecting our economy, employers, and quality of life, Ed’s experience as a small business owner has provided insight on the challenges employers and families face from their government.

Ed is active in his communities and has worked with several non-profit and professional organizations dedicated to improving lives and opportunities. He has also held leadership positions with policy-related organizations, including the Natural Resources and Infrastructure Committee for the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Ed and his wife, Marcie, have been married since 1996 and live in Kalama.
