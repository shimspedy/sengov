Edwin Obras is a Democratic member of the Washington House of Representatives, representing the 33rd Legislative District. He assumed office on December 10, 2024, and his current term is set to end in January 2027.

Born in the Philippines, Edwin immigrated to the United States as a child and grew up in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Seattle. He is the first in his family to graduate from college, earning a Bachelor of Arts in American Ethnic Studies from the University of Washington. He later pursued further education at Northeastern University, where he obtained a Graduate Certificate in Non-Profit, Philanthropy, and Social Change in 2015, followed by a Master of Public Administration in 2016.

Edwin has dedicated over 25 years to the human services field, working in various capacities within non-profits and the City of Seattle. His work has focused on critical areas such as homelessness, anti-hunger initiatives, youth development, community safety, and support for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. His commitment to community service extends beyond his professional career; he served as Chair of the SeaTac Human Services Advisory Committee from 2016 to 2018 and has been actively involved with the Filipino Community of Seattle. As a board member and former president of the organization, he has played a pivotal role in initiatives like the capital campaign to build affordable housing units for families.

In the Washington House of Representatives, Edwin serves on several key committees, including the Health Care and Wellness Committee, the Labor and Workplace Standards Committee, and the Community Safety Committee. His legislative priorities reflect his lifelong dedication to social justice, equity, and community well-being.

Outside of his professional and legislative responsibilities, Edwin is a proud father to a young adult son, who is also a graduate of the University of Washington. His personal and professional journey exemplifies his unwavering commitment to creating a more inclusive and supportive society for all.
