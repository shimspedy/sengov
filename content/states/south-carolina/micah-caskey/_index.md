Micah Caskey lives in Springdale, South Carolina — right where he was born and raised. He attended local public schools in Lexington 2 School District, grew up in McGregor Presbyterian Church, played sports all over town, and completed his Eagle Scout project at Harbison State Forest.

The son of a small business owner, Micah started working long before he had a driver's license. Working in his father's locksmith shop taught Micah that nothing in life is free — everything worth having has to be earned. Hard work matters. That work ethic helped him earn a full scholarship to college. 

After college, Micah spent the next several years on active duty in the Marine Corps — rising to the rank of Captain. Micah commanded both company- and platoon-sized units during his two combat tours of duty in Al Anbar Province, including Fallujah and Ramadi, Iraq. Later, in 2009, Micah left law school for a year to continue his service to the country; it was during that year that he commanded a small team of specialized Marines in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.  

Micah returned from Afghanistan and completed his law degree at the University of South Carolina. He also earned a master's degree in International Business Administration in the #1-ranked international M.B.A. program at the University of South Carolina's Darla Moore School of Business. While in graduate school, Micah studied abroad in Europe and in Latin America, where he learned to speak Spanish.

After graduating, Micah worked in an international firm as a management consultant in Alaska.  In that capacity, he worked with Fortune 100 clients in the Oil & Gas industry to increase profitability and improve safety culture. 

Seeking a return home, he left Anchorage and Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and returned to South Carolina to serve as a criminal prosecutor in South Carolina’s 11th Judicial Circuit, based in Lexington County. In addition to his role there, Micah served statewide as a Special Assistant Attorney General, pro bono, to prosecute domestic violence cases. As a prosecutor, Micah prosecuted hundreds of cases, handling all kinds of felony crimes — from drug trafficking to murder — including several high-profile trials.  

In November 2016, Micah was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives and was elected by his peers to lead the Freshman Caucus as its chairman.  He was re-elected to the House in 2018, 2020, and 2022. He is currently assigned to the House Ways & Means Committee and the House Ethics Committee. 

Micah also owns and operates a statewide private law practice, Caskey Law Firm, P.A., based in West Columbia. He is admitted to practice in the United States Supreme Court, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, the District Court for the District of South Carolina, and all South Carolina state courts.
