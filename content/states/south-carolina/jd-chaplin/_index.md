J.D. Chaplin is a Republican member of the South Carolina State Senate, representing District 29. He assumed office on November 11, 2024, and his current term is set to end on November 13, 2028.

Born on April 7, 1994, J.D. Chaplin grew up in Darlington County, South Carolina. He is a fourth-generation row crop farmer, a profession that has deeply connected him to the agricultural roots of his community. Chaplin attended Florence-Darlington Technical College before earning a Bachelor of Science degree from Charleston Southern University in 2018. His commitment to his community is evident not only in his professional life but also in his personal endeavors. He has served as the President of the Darlington County FFA and was recognized with the South Carolina FFA Star Regional Farmer Award in 2012.

Chaplin's dedication to service extends beyond agriculture. He is an Eagle Scout and has been actively involved with the Boy Scouts of America, serving as an Assistant Scout Master for Troop 523 in Hartsville, South Carolina. His contributions to scouting have been recognized with honors such as The Vigil Honor for the Order of the Arrow and the National Eagle Scout Association's Outstanding Eagle Scout Award.

In his political career, Chaplin has been a steadfast advocate for his constituents in Chesterfield, Darlington, Lee, Marlboro, and Sumter Counties. His legislative priorities include supporting agricultural development, enhancing infrastructure, and promoting family and veterans' services. He serves on several Senate committees, including Agriculture and Natural Resources, Family and Veterans' Services, Fish, Game and Forestry, Judiciary, and Transportation.

Chaplin's journey to the South Carolina State Senate was marked by determination and resilience. After an unsuccessful bid in 2020, he ran again in 2024 and won a closely contested race. His victory not only secured his place in the Senate but also contributed to a Republican supermajority in the chamber. Chaplin's leadership and vision continue to shape the policies and initiatives that impact his district and the state of South Carolina.
