Tom Fernandez is a Republican serving in the South Carolina State Senate, representing District 39. He assumed office in 2024, and his current term is set to end in 2028.

Born on February 28, 1978, in Livonia, Michigan, Fernandez grew up on a farm where he learned the values of hard work and self-sufficiency. His upbringing instilled in him a deep sense of personal responsibility and discipline. After moving to the South in 1992, Fernandez worked various jobs, including bagging groceries at Publix, before pursuing higher education later in life. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science from Coastal Carolina University, a Juris Doctor from Charleston School of Law, and an MBA from The Citadel.

Fernandez's career began in Information Technology, but his passion for law and the U.S. Constitution led him to establish his own law practice. His experience in building a successful business reinforced his commitment to principles like limited government, free markets, and individual liberties. In 2018, Fernandez ran for a seat in the South Carolina House of Representatives but was unsuccessful. Undeterred, he continued to advocate for fiscal responsibility and individual freedom, becoming a respected voice in the constitutional movement.

In 2024, Fernandez ran for the South Carolina State Senate and successfully flipped District 39, defeating the Democratic incumbent. He now serves on several committees, including Corrections and Penology, Education, Family and Veterans' Services, Judiciary, and Medical Affairs. His legislative priorities focus on promoting liberty, prosperity, and individual opportunity for all South Carolinians.

Fernandez resides in Summerville, South Carolina, with his wife, Darlene, a retired nurse, and their six daughters. The family enjoys spending time together, cherishing moments with their five grandchildren and three small dogs. Fernandez’s journey from a farm in Michigan to the South Carolina State Senate is a testament to his perseverance and dedication to serving his community.
