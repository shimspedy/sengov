Kathy Landing is a remarkable individual with a diverse background—a successful businesswoman, financial planner, community advocate, military spouse, and devoted mother. Her education and experience uniquely position her to address the complex challenges facing our town and state. As a South Carolina State House Representative, Kathy is a staunch advocate for practical, conservative solutions.

Early Life and Resilience:
Despite facing significant adversity in her early years, Kathy embodies resilience and optimism. She tragically lost both of her parents by the age of 13. At that point, she moved in with her brother, an Army chaplain stationed at Fort Bragg. While her brother conducted services for the 82nd Airborne Division, Kathy contributed by playing the church organ. Her determination and positive outlook were evident even then.

Education and Career:
At just 16 years old, Kathy began her journey at Duke University. Four years later, she graduated and became engaged to Joe Landing, a Naval ROTC student at Duke. In 1984, they married and settled in Charleston, where Joe served as a United States Navy officer. It was during this time that Kathy took a bold step and started building her financial planning business in the Lowcountry.

Kathy's impressive career spans 37 years of disciplined financial planning. As a Certified Financial Planner practitioner with a Master of Science in Financial Planning, she currently serves as Senior Vice President of Investments for Raymond James and Associates. Her expertise lies in helping Lowcountry families identify and pursue their financial goals while minimizing risk.

Community Leadership:
Kathy's commitment to her community is unwavering. Elected to the Mount Pleasant Town Council in 2017, she chaired the Economic Development Committee and contributed to the Finance Committee. Under her leadership, the town consistently achieved balanced budgets and maintained a AAA bond rating—one of the strongest fiscal positions in the nation.

Beyond the town council, Kathy actively participated in various boards and committees. She served on the Board of Directors of the Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce, advocating for local job-creating businesses. Additionally, she contributed to the Charleston Convention and Visitors Bureau.

Military Connection:
Kathy's family history is intertwined with military service. Her ancestors fought for American freedom during the Revolutionary War, and her grandfather served bravely in World War I. Her mother, too, honorably served in the Women’s Army Corps during World War II. Kathy's personal connection deepened when her husband was deployed to the Middle East and Persian Gulf for 15 of their first 24 months of marriage. She understands the sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform and remains committed to supporting veterans, active-duty personnel, and their families.

In summary, Kathy Landing's journey—from overcoming adversity to becoming a respected leader—is a testament to her resilience, dedication, and positive impact on South Carolina. As she continues her service as a State House Representative, her common-sense approach and conservative values will undoubtedly benefit her constituents.
