Carlisle Kennedy is a Republican serving in the South Carolina State Senate, representing District 23. He assumed office on December 4, 2024, and his current term is set to end on November 13, 2028.

Born and raised in Lexington County, South Carolina, Carlisle Kennedy has deep roots in his community. He attended Batesburg-Leesville High School before pursuing higher education at Clemson University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in corporate finance and a master's in business administration. Later, he graduated from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 2019. His professional journey began as an assistant solicitor in the 11th Judicial Circuit, and he later joined his family's practice at the Kennedy Law Firm in Batesburg-Leesville.

Kennedy's political career took off in 2024 when he challenged incumbent Senator Katrina Shealy in the Republican primary. After a competitive runoff, he emerged victorious and went on to win the general election unopposed. His campaign emphasized fresh leadership and a commitment to addressing the needs of his constituents in District 23.

In the South Carolina Senate, Kennedy serves on several key committees, including Banking and Insurance, Fish, Game and Forestry, Judiciary, Labor, Commerce and Industry, and Rules. His legislative priorities focus on economic development, education reform, and preserving South Carolina's natural resources.

Outside of his political and professional life, Kennedy is a family man. He resides in Lexington County with his wife, Brooke, and their child. His dedication to public service and his community continues to shape his work in the Senate, where he strives to make a positive impact for the people of South Carolina.
