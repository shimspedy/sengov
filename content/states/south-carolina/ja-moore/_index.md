JA Moore is an American politician representing the 15th District (Berkeley & Charleston Counties) in the South Carolina House of Representatives. He has been in office since November 2018. Moore is a member of the Democratic Party and has made significant contributions during his tenure.

Born in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Moore attended Johnson & Wales University, where he earned a Culinary Arts Degree in 2005. Interestingly, he is the first chef ever elected to the General Assembly. His unique background brings a fresh perspective to the political arena.

As a legislator, Moore has been actively involved in various committees. He serves as the 1st Vice Chair of the Interstate Cooperation Committee and is also a member of the Medical, Military, Public, and Municipal Affairs Committee. His key political goals include advocating for affordable housing, gun control, reproductive rights, veteran’s rights, and clean water.

In 2018, Moore achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first Democrat to represent South Carolina's 15th District. He secured re-election in 2020, demonstrating his continued commitment to public service. Notably, he endorsed Democrat Pete Buttigieg for the presidency in 2020 and has been an advocate for other Democratic candidates.

Recently, Moore announced his intention to run for the South Carolina Senate District 42 seat in a special election. Although he faced strong competition in the Democratic primary, his dedication to public service remains unwavering.

Representative JA Moore's journey—from chef to legislator—reflects his passion for making a positive impact on his community.
