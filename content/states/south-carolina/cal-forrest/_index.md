Brought to Batesburg-Leesville as a toddler, Cal Forrest was shaped by his surroundings and adopted the fighting spirit of the Batesburg-Leesville and Saluda communities. His parents and neighbors instilled in him a blue-collar resolve, teaching him the value of hard work and perseverance. Unfortunately, at the age of 24, Cal suffered a traumatic injury that left him paralyzed. Despite the challenges, his faith in God and the support he received allowed him to overcome physical limitations and emotional scars. This life-altering event reinforced his belief in living without regret and giving everything in all endeavors.

Steadfast Devotion to Conservative Causes:
Cal has spent his adult life championing conservative causes. As a small business owner and advocate for the Second Amendment, he has consistently fought against unnecessary government regulations and interference in everyday life. Concerned that politicians prioritize special interests and fail to respond to constituents, Cal decided to run for the South Carolina House of Representatives. His goals include promoting job creation, improving infrastructure, reforming education, reducing the tax burden, eliminating wasteful spending, and providing better representation for South Carolinians.
