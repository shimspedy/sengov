Nikki G. Setzler is an American politician and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate. Born on August 7, 1945, in Asheville, North Carolina, he has represented the 26th District since 1976. Throughout his tenure, Setzler has been the sole elected Democrat representing a portion of Lexington County above the county level.

His political career includes notable victories in state elections:
- In the 2016 election, Setzler defeated Republican challenger Brad Lindsey, securing about 58% of the vote.
- In 2020, he emerged victorious again, defeating Republican challenger Chris Smith with approximately 54% of the vote.
- However, on January 10, 2024, Setzler announced his retirement from public office and will not seek re-election in the 2024 South Carolina Senate election.

Notably, after the resignation of North Dakota's Ray Holmberg on June 1, 2022, Setzler became the country's longest-serving incumbent state senator. His dedication to public service and bipartisan leadership has left a lasting impact on South Carolina politics.

Nikki Setzler is not only a seasoned politician but also a family man, small businessman, and reformer. He has tirelessly advocated for local issues that matter to his constituents and the people of South Carolina.
