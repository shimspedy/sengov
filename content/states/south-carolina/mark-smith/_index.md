Marvin M. "Mark" Smith, a successful American businessman and politician, represents the 99th District in the South Carolina House of Representatives. Born on June 18, 1970, in Bamberg, South Carolina, Mark has deep roots in the Lowcountry. He earned an associate degree from Fayetteville Technical Community College.

Mark is the owner and president of McAlister-Smith Funeral Homes, Avinger Funeral Home, and the Palmetto Cremation Society. His commitment to reform and accountability has made him a tireless advocate for positive change. Mark's conservative values and dedication to public service led him to run for the 99th district seat in the South Carolina House of Representatives.

In 2017, Mark was a Republican candidate for the same district but narrowly lost to Nancy Mace. Undeterred, he announced his candidacy again in October 2019 after Mace decided to run for the United States House of Representatives. This time, Mark emerged victorious, defeating David Herndon in the Republican primary and Democratic nominee Jen Gibson in the general election.

Mark and his wife, Elayne (n√©e Forastiere), have been married for 25 years and are proud parents to three college-aged sons: Parker, Avery, and Domenic.
