William H. Bailey, born on December 4, 1962, is an American politician. He represents the 104th District in the South Carolina House of Representatives, a position he has held since 2018. Bailey is a member of the Republican party.

Before entering politics, Bailey had a career in public safety, serving as the Director of Public Safety for the City of North Myrtle Beach. He is an alumnus of Horry-Georgetown Technical College (A.D.), Coastal Carolina University (B.A.), and Webster University (M.S.).

In 2021, Bailey announced his campaign for the South Carolina 7th district in Congress, challenging incumbent Tom Rice. However, he later decided not to run for Congress in 2022 and instead sought re-election to his seat in the South Carolina House, which he won unopposed.

Bailey's dedication to public service and his commitment to representing his constituents make him a notable figure in South Carolina politics.
