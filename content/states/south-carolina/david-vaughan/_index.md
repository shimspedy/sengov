David Vaughan is an American businessman and politician. He was born in Greenville, South Carolina, and graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science degree. In 1996, Vaughan became a business owner, constructing self-storage units in the Greenville area. He won the June 2022 Republican primary with 52% of the vote and went on to win the general election unopposed. Vaughan succeeded Garry R. Smith, who had held the office since 2003 and did not seek reelection. He assumed office on December 6, 2022, and currently serves on the House Education and Public Works Committee. Notably, in 2023, Vaughan was briefly among the Republican co-sponsors of the South Carolina Prenatal Equal Protection Act of 2023, which would have made women who had abortions eligible for the death penalty; however, he later withdrew his sponsorship, citing an error.
