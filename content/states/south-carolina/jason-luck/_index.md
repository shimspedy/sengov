Jason Luck, a member of the Democratic Party, serves in the South Carolina House of Representatives, representing District 54. He assumed office on November 11, 2024, and his current term is set to end on November 9, 2026.

Born on July 4, 1977, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Jason Luck has a rich and diverse background that combines legal expertise, artistic heritage, and a commitment to public service. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2000 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Anthropology and Mathematical Sciences, focusing on computer science. Following his undergraduate studies, Luck pursued a law degree at the University of South Carolina School of Law, graduating in 2005.

Luck's professional journey began in the software industry, but he soon transitioned to law, practicing in Charleston, South Carolina, for several years. His legal career is marked by significant achievements, including being named South Carolina Pro Bono Lawyer of the Year in 2013 for his dedication to representing individuals in need. In 2020, he moved to Bennettsville, South Carolina, where he established his own law practice, focusing on appellate and intellectual property law.

Beyond his legal career, Luck is deeply connected to his family's artistic legacy as a sixth-generation potter. His father, Sid Luck, is a renowned potter whose works have even graced the White House. This artistic heritage has shaped Luck's identity and contributed to his multifaceted personality.

In the political arena, Luck stepped into the role of representative for District 54 after the retirement of Democratic incumbent Patricia Henegan. His district encompasses Marlboro County and parts of Chesterfield, Darlington, and Dillon Counties. Luck's campaign was bolstered by endorsements from Henegan and Douglas Jennings Jr., both of whom had long-standing ties to the district.

Jason Luck's personal life is equally noteworthy. He married Emzee Hilliard in 2019, and the couple has one child, Elspeth. His commitment to his community, his family, and his profession underscores his dedication to serving the people of South Carolina. As a representative, Luck continues to advocate for policies that reflect his values and the needs of his constituents.
