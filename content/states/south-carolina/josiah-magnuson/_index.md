Josiah Magnuson, born on August 17, 1991, hails from Greenville, South Carolina. He resides near Fingerville with his wife, LeeAnn Gahagan, and their baby girl, JoLee Jael. Josiah's upbringing was shaped by his early years as the son of a Baptist pastor, and he was homeschooled until his sophomore year. After graduating from Kingsway Christian School in Ohio, he returned to the Upcountry region of South Carolina.

Although not an attorney or a self-proclaimed politician, Josiah has been actively engaged in the political process. His convictions led him to take action on various issues, including sound money, opposition to Obamacare, advocating for personhood rights for unborn children, and supporting traditional marriage. In 2007, he founded Soldiers of Biblical Reformation (SBR), a nondenominational Christian club that encourages families to uphold God's design in all aspects of life, including civil government.

Josiah Magnuson currently serves as the Secretary of the South Carolina Freedom Caucus and holds the position of 2nd Vice Chair on the House Agriculture, Natural Resources & Environmental Affairs Committee. Additionally, he is a member of the House Legislative Oversight Committee. Beyond politics, Josiah works in sales and marketing as a business consultant, providing schools across the country with tools to train children in the Biblical worldview.

His faith extends beyond Sunday mornings, and he continues to be a light in both the community and the culture.
