Justin Tyler Bamberg, born on March 7, 1987, hails from Bamberg, South Carolina. He is an American attorney and a dedicated politician currently serving as a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from the 90th district. This district encompasses all of Bamberg County and parts of Orangeburg County.

**Early Life and Education:**
Justin Bamberg earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of South Carolina and later obtained a Juris Doctor from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 2011.

**Political Career:**
Bamberg is a Democrat and has been representing District 90 since December 2014. His predecessor, Bakari Sellers, vacated the seat to run for Lieutenant Governor. In the Democratic Primary, Bamberg defeated Monnie Singleton and narrowly won against Republican Travis Lee Avant in the general election. He has been an active member of the House Judiciary Committee.

Notably, Bamberg was involved in the 2016 presidential race. Initially endorsing Hillary Clinton, he later switched his support to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, emphasizing Sanders' commitment to "racial, social, and economic justice." Bamberg even served as one of Sanders' national surrogates during the campaign.

In subsequent elections, Bamberg successfully defended his seat, including a victory against Evert Comer, Jr. in the Democratic Primary. He has consistently advocated for progressive causes and endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

As of now, Bamberg continues to serve the citizens of District 90, working diligently on legislative matters that impact his community.
