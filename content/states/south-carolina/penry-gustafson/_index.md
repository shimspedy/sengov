Penry Gustafson is a Republican member of the South Carolina Senate, serving since 2021. She represents District 27, which includes Chesterfield, Kershaw, and Lancaster Counties. Born on May 20, 1970, in Columbia, South Carolina, Gustafson holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Newberry College. Her political career has been marked by active participation in various committees, including Agriculture and Natural Resources, Corrections and Penology, Family and Veterans' Services, and Judiciary.

In May 2023, Senator Gustafson joined forces with other female state senators—across party lines—to block a bill that would have banned all abortions in South Carolina. Their collective action garnered attention and recognition, leading to their selection for the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award. Gustafson's principled stance on abortion rights also became a point of contention during the 2024 election, where she faced a primary challenge from Allen Blackmon, a Lancaster County councilman.

Beyond politics, Senator Gustafson has a diverse background, including owning a restaurant, working in sales, engaging in Christian ministry, and serving as a case manager for adults with special needs. Her commitment to advocacy and community service underscores her dedication to the people she represents.
