Katrina Frye Shealy, born on December 25, 1954, in Columbia, South Carolina, is an American politician and a former member of the South Carolina State Senate. She represented District 23 in Lexington County. Although a Republican, she was elected as a petition candidate.

Senator Shealy made history in 2012 when she became the only woman in the South Carolina Senate. Throughout her tenure, she championed causes related to children, vulnerable adults, Alzheimer's, veterans, and embattled state agencies. She served as the Chair of the Senate’s Family and Veterans’ Services Committee.

In 2024, Senator Shealy faced a runoff election and was ultimately defeated. Her work in the Senate left a lasting impact, and she remains an influential figure in South Carolina politics.

Shealy's background extends beyond politics; she is an insurance executive and previously chaired the Lexington County Republican Party. Her commitment to Juvenile Justice reform and her advocacy for various causes have left a mark on the state's political landscape.

Senator Shealy is married to James Irby Shealy, and they have three children: Erica Taylor Armstrong, Stephanie Michelle Shealy, and Rhonda Shealy Williams. She is also a proud grandmother to five grandsons.
