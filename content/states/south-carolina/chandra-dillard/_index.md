Chandra Dillard has been a State Representative from Greenville County since 2008. She began her public service on Greenville City Council in 1999 by making history as the first woman elected from her district.  Chandra currently serves as the SC House Deputy Minority Leader, a Member and past Treasurer of the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus, and a Member and past Chair of the SC General Assembly Women’s Caucus.
Chandra currently serves on the Ways and Means Committee. She has also been appointed to the special House Legislative Committee on Equitable Justice and Law Enforcement Reform.  She formerly served as Secretary on the House Ethics Committee and as the first woman Chair on the Environmental Affairs Subcommittee of the Agriculture & Natural Resources Committee.  Chandra is also a former President of the Conference of Black Municipal Elected Officials.
Chandra is a hands-on advocate for her constituents.  Over the course of her public service she has secured more than $100 million dollars to address community development, human investment and infrastructure needs. In 2018, Chandra was honored to receive the South Carolina Democratic Party’s Elected Official of the Year Award.
Chandra is the Director of Community Relations for Furman University.   She holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from Winthrop University and a Masters in Public Administration from Walden University. She is also a graduate of Leadership Greenville, Furman’s Riley Institute Diversity Leadership Initiative, and Leadership South Carolina.  She is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. and a lay servant at John Wesley United Methodist Church. 
Chandra’s efforts to improve her state and community have not gone unnoticed but have been recognized by the numerous local, statewide, and national awards and honors she has received.  And while she’s grateful for the recognitions, she takes greater pride in the “team efforts” to improve the quality of life for those persons who are often unseen and underserved.
