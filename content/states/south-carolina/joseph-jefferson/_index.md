Representative Joseph Jefferson, Jr. is the epitome of leading by example through his commitment to creating and executing fair laws in the state of South Carolina. He was born and raised in Pineville and grew up to give back to the community that provided so many opportunities for him.

After graduating from St. Stephen High School, Joe went on to Claflin University, where he earned his Bachelor’s of Science in 1970. After college, he was afforded the opportunity to be a specialist assistant for Congressman Mendel Davis, working with constituents to solve problems in the Lowcountry.

Throughout his career, Joe has made government work for the people. For 32 years, he worked as a Federal Government Administrator – starting off as a Staffing Specialist, a position in which he coordinated newly hired employees for the Department of the Navy at the Charleston Navy Base, and ending up as the Equal Employment Manager at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. Later, Joe worked at the South Carolina Department of Transportation, helping to address the Lowcountry’s traffic problems and growing infrastructure needs.

During this time, his passion for public service led him to run for office. He served as the Chairman of the Berkeley County School Board from 1982 until 1993, a role in which he worked to improve the quality of local schools. He later attended the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy Magistrate School in order to serve as a Magistrate Judge for Berkeley County, interpreting the law in a just and fair way.

Joe now represents House District 102 in Berkeley and Dorchester counties. Since he was first elected to the State House in 2005, he has been a leading voice for supporting public education, expanding access to affordable health care, and building a local economy that supports good-paying jobs here in South Carolina. He currently serves as chair of the Banking & Consumer Affairs Subcommittee of the Labor, Commerce and Industry Committee where he works to bring industry to South Carolina. He also serves as the 1st Vice Chair of the Legislative Oversight Committee, where he leads the legislature’s supervision of state agencies.

He lives in Pineville with his wife, Deloris, and their three children – Trena, Marva, and Joseph III. Back home, Joe stays active in his church, local community organizations, and his radio program.
