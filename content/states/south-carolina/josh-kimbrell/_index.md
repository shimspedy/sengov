Joshua Brett Kimbrell (born December 18, 1984) is an American aviation leasing operator and politician. He is also a former Christian talk radio host. Kimbrell has served as a member of the South Carolina Senate from the 11th District (Spartanburg) since his election in 2020. He is a member of the Republican Party.

In 2020, Kimbrell defeated incumbent Democrat Glenn G. Reese, who had held the seat in the South Carolina Senate's 11th District since 1991. During the 2022 session, Kimbrell introduced a budget proviso to ban "prurient" books in children's library sections at public libraries, although some librarians and other lawmakers expressed concerns about the vague language of the proposal.

Kimbrell supported Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries, later switching his endorsement to former President Donald Trump after DeSantis withdrew from the race.

Personal life: In October 2014, Kimbrell was arrested and charged with sex crimes against his 3-year-old son. However, the charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence in February 2015.

Electoral history:
- 2018 U.S. House of Representatives Republican primary: Lost
- 2020 South Carolina Senate General Election: Won.
