Kambrell Garvin was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina. His upbringing was shaped by the unwavering support of his single mother, Dr. Sonji Garvin Baxter. At a young age, Kambrell faced a speech impediment, prompting his mother to change her career path and become a speech pathologist—her determination to help her son exemplifying the power of maternal love and resilience.

Inspired by the legacy of his grandfather—a trailblazer who fearlessly served as the first African-American on his local city council—Kambrell embarked on his own journey of public service. In 2018, at the remarkable age of 26, he was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives, representing House District 77 in Richland County, Columbia.

Not one to rest, Kambrell then attended the University of South Carolina School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 2019.

But that's not all—Kambrell's thirst for knowledge led him to South Carolina State University, where he pursued an MBA, further enriching his understanding of leadership and policy.

Beyond academia, Kambrell's life has been marked by service. He worked as a public school teacher in the Colleton County School District from 2013 to 2016, advocating for quality education and making a difference in the lives of young learners. As an alumnus of Teach for America, he continued to champion educational equity.

His involvement extends to community organizations as well. Kambrell is a proud member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated, and actively participates in the Columbia NAACP. Additionally, he serves as Vice Chair of the Richland County Legislative Delegation and as Parliamentarian for the SC Legislative Black Caucus.
