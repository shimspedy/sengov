Cody Mitchell is an American politician and lawyer representing the 65th district in the South Carolina House of Representatives. Born on June 11, 1986, in Greeneville, Tennessee, Mitchell has had a diverse career.

Early in his life, Mitchell joined the military, serving from 2008 to 2012. He retired with the rank of major from the South Carolina Army National Guard. Later, he pursued higher education, earning a Bachelor of Arts from Presbyterian College and a Juris Doctor from the University of South Carolina.

Mitchell became a law partner at the firm "Lucas, White & Mitchell" in 2011, where he worked alongside Jay Lucas, who would later become the Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives. Mitchell also served as a municipal judge for several towns, including Bethune and Hartsville.

In 2022, Mitchell was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives, succeeding Jay Lucas. He was sworn in on December 6, 2022, and currently serves on the judiciary and rules committee.

Despite facing controversy related to a DUI charge (which was later dismissed), Mitchell continues to serve his constituents in the state legislature.
