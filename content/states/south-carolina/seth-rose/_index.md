Seth Rose, an American lawyer and public servant, has seamlessly intertwined his passion for justice, community service, and leadership, creating a legacy that resonates far beyond his extensive legal and political career.

Prior to his legal and political career, Rose was a First Team All-America singles tennis player for the University of South Carolina. In his college career Rose twice defeated the number one ranked NCAA singles player in the nation and advanced to the Round of 16 in the 2003 Div. I NCAA Men's Singles Championships held in Athens, Georgia. He was inducted into the Gamecock Athletic Hall of Fame in 2014.  

A proud graduate of the University of South Carolina School of Law, Rose's journey has been marked by unwavering dedication and a tireless commitment to representing his state in countless ways.

Representative Rose has recently received several prestigious awards and recognitions for his significant contributions to our capital city, Columbia. He was honored with the President's Award from the Columbia Council of Neighborhoods for his outstanding service. Additionally, the 5 Points Merchants Association has recognized him as a champion for Columbia for his instrumental role in a transformative $5 million project on Harden Street scheduled to commence in April 2024. Most notably, Representative Rose has been named the 2024 'Legislative Hero' by the Alliance for Full Acceptance (AFFA) for his tireless advocacy for the basic rights of all citizens, including the LGBTQ community.

Before his tenure in the Legislature, Representative Rose served as a County Councilman, earning a reputation as a highly effective and popular local leader known as the 'voice of reason'. Notable achievements during his time as Councilman include implementing roll call voting at County Council meetings, broadcasting meetings over cable television and the internet, halting unwanted rock quarries near Williams-Brice Stadium and the Arthurtown neighborhood, and facilitating the redevelopment of the Rosewood Curtiss Wright Hangar.

He has also been commended for his exemplary constituent service, earning recognition as the "Green Elected Official of the Year" from 
Keep the Midlands Beautiful, and for his advocacy for diversity and inclusion, receiving the "Courage in Leadership Award" for amending Richland County's discrimination policy to include sexual orientation as a protected class.

As a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, Rose's impact continues to reverberate. Serving on the House Judiciary committee, the Operations and Management committee, and the Joint Legislative Committee to Screen Candidates for College and University Boards of Trustees, he has consistently proven himself as a legislator dedicated to progress.

Rose's legislative accomplishments are numerous, including the passage of bills addressing disorderly conduct and expanding youthful offender criminal record expungements. His advocacy has secured millions for road improvements, pedestrian safety enhancements, and transformative projects in District 72, exemplifying his commitment to enhancing the quality of life for his constituents.
