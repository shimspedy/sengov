Born on March 17, 1958, in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Jerry Govan Jr. has dedicated much of his life to public service and education. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from South Carolina State University in 1982 and pursued graduate studies at the University of South Carolina.
