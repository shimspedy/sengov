Don Chapman is an American architect, builder, and politician. He represents the 6th district in the South Carolina House of Representatives. Born in Japan in 1966, Chapman attended the Savannah College of Art and Design, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in interior design and a master's degree in architecture. In 1994, he founded his own architecture firm in Anderson, South Carolina.

Chapman's political journey began in 2008 when he was elected to the Anderson City Council, a position he held for 14 years. In 2021, he resigned from the council to run for state representative in South Carolina's 8th district. His opponent at the time, Jonathon D. Hill, faced accusations of multiple ethics violations. Chapman secured the nomination and went on to win the 2022 general election with over 70% of the vote.

As a lifelong conservative and Anderson County resident, Don Chapman brings his problem-solving skills and community involvement to the state legislature. With over 30 years of experience as a small business owner, he understands the impact of government policies on hardworking South Carolinians.
