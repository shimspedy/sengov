Born on July 1, 1970, in Greenville, South Carolina, Jason Elliott has deep roots in the community he now represents. He earned his bachelor's degree from Clemson University in 1993 and went on to obtain his Juris Doctor from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1996. His professional career began as an Assistant Solicitor in the Tenth Judicial Circuit, where he served from 1996 to 1999. Following this, he worked as District Director for U.S. Representative Jim DeMint from 1999 to 2003, further solidifying his commitment to public service.

During his tenure in the House, he served on the Education and Public Works Committee, where he chaired the Motor Vehicle Subcommittee. His legislative efforts were marked by a focus on education, infrastructure, and community development. Notably, Elliott made history as the first openly gay man elected to the South Carolina General Assembly, a milestone that underscored his dedication to inclusivity and representation.

In 2024, Elliott transitioned to the South Carolina State Senate, succeeding Dwight Loftis in representing District 6. His campaign emphasized the importance of economic growth, education reform, and healthcare accessibility. Elliott's ability to connect with constituents and address their concerns has been a hallmark of his political career. As a senator, he continues to advocate for policies that benefit the residents of Greenville County and South Carolina as a whole.

Beyond his legislative duties, Elliott is actively involved in community organizations. He has served as a board member and chairman of the Greenville Tech Charter High School and has been a member of the Rotary Club of Greenville since 1999, even serving as its president in 2008. His commitment to community service is evident in his efforts to improve transportation infrastructure and support local educational initiatives.
