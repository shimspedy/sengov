He was then elected to serve as State Representative for House District 124 in 2000. He was later entrusted with an appointment to the powerful Appropriations Committee where he secured millions of dollars for various crucial San Antonio initiatives. In his final session serving in the House, Menéndez was appointed Chairman of the House Committee on Defense and Veterans’ Affairs where he secured one of the state’s largest mental health programs for Veterans.
