State Representative Ben Bumgarner represents House District 63, succeeding now State Senator Tan Parker. House District 63 covers the southern portion of Denton County including Flower Mound, Lewisville, Carrollton, Trophy Club and Roanoke.

Ben serves on the Defense & Veterans' Affairs and the International Relations & Economic Development Committees.

Ben is a North Texas native and a proud resident of the Town of Flower Mound. Ben’s background as the co-owner of a small business, Evolve Weapons Systems, and a community leader has equipped him to serve as a voice for all Texans in the House.

Before running for the State House, Ben served on the Flower Mound Town Council as well as serving as Mayor Pro Tem. While on town council, Ben led the charge to lower property taxes to the lowest rate in the town's history, make the local government more transparent, and lower the town’s debt.

Ben is a graduate of Austin College.

Ben and his wife, Mindy, both met while attending Austin College. They have one daughter, Cecelia; and two fur babies, Rebel and Abbie. Ben and Mindy are members of the Flower Mound United Methodist Church.
