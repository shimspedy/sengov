State Representative Christian Manuel was born in Nederland, Texas. He was raised in Texas and California and is the eldest of six siblings, four brothers and two sisters. Rep. Manuel’s passion for politics is deeply rooted in his life, thanks to his family’s involvement and leadership in political activism. As a child, he grew up engaged in politics with the understanding of its impact on the community and state.

Representative Manuel has nearly two decades of experience in Texas state politics. He started working for former State Representative Joseph Deshotel when he was eighteen as a case worker. He then worked as District Director and progressed to Chief of Staff—a position he held for a decade. Manuel’s professional experience serving as the right-hand man to a veteran legislator like Rep. Deshotel has been pivotal in ensuring triumphs for the district. During this time, he gained the ability to maneuver within the complicated Texas political scene of congressmen, lobbyists, and industry experts with a sagacity that only comes with years of hard work and dedication. Rep. Manuel has worked diligently to bring home victories for House District-22 these past two decades and will continue to work tirelessly to help execute legislation for his community and public.

Rep. Manuel has many hobbies. He enjoys traveling internationally, writing novels, and spending time with his family and dog, Sebastian. His travels have influenced how he sees the world and helped him to connect and create friendships across different cultures and ideologies successfully. He looks forward to representing House District-22.
