Lacey Hull is a native Houstonian who was born and raised in House District 138, attended Spring Branch ISD schools and earned a bachelor's in political science and history from the University of Houston. First elected in 2020, Lacey and her family live in Spring Branch where she formerly served as president of her Homeowners Association. Lacey and her family attend Bayou City Fellowship Church.

During the 88th Legislature, Lacey was reappointed to serve on the House Committees on Human Services and Insurance, and appointed Vice-Chair of the Youth Health & Safety select committee, and to serve on the Local & Consent Calendars committee. She was also reappointed to serve as an at-large member of the Texas House Republican Caucus Policy Committee and continues to serve as a member of the bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform Caucus, of which she was selected Co-Vice Chair.

Lacey was nominated by her colleagues to serve as Chair of the Harris County delegation for the 88th legislative term. She is a proud advocate for the economic prosperity of the Houston area through her membership of the Texas Legislative Ports Caucus and the Aerospace Caucus.

In the 88th legislative session, Lacey worked to pass laws to protect children, such as restricting the use of restraints in schools, placing guidelines on school-issued devices, and enhancing penalties for trafficking offenses near foster care and child care facilities, as well as strengthen the rights of families in the CPS system. Other laws she authored reduce step therapy requirements for patients with Serious Mental Illness, provide case management services to high-risk pregnant women in Medicaid, and authorize family leave insurance in Texas. Lacey is especially proud of the laws she passed to protect victims of crime and family violence, including adding provisions prohibiting tracking or monitoring to protective orders and the harassment offense, and requiring judicial training on the dynamics of family violence.

During her freshman term, Lacey worked to pass her principal bill, "John and Joseph's Law," which requires the reporting of missing persons to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. She also worked on legislation to support and protect the rights of families, and ensure that Medicaid patients with severe mental illness maintain access to prescribed medications.

Prior to being elected to the Texas House, Lacey worked with a variety of nonprofits to advocate for policies that protect the liberties of Texas families. As a State Representative, Lacey is committed to preserving individual liberty, unleashing economic opportunity, ensuring public safety, and providing quality education for all students
