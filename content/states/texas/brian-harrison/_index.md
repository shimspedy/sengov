Brian Harrison is a passionate and effective advocate for limited government and individual liberty who proudly represents House District 10, which covers all of Ellis County. A native Texan and graduate of Ovilla Christian School, Brian and his family have long been involved in Ellis County and committed themselves to protecting our fundamental, constitutional rights.

During the Trump Administration, Brian served as the Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the largest government agency in the world with a budget of over $1.4 trillion and 25 divisions, where he led a staff of over 85,000 employees.

Under his leadership, HHS protected the unborn, secured the border, increased private health insurance options, advanced government policies that decreased costs, protected patients, increased transparency and accountability, inserted free market forces into the healthcare sector, and responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. He helped launch Operation Warp Speed and successfully led historic deregulatory efforts such as sunsetting almost 20,000 regulations, ending unfair taxes, eliminating harmful programs, instituting a taxpayer accountability board, and creating term limits for senior career officials. His actions have been projected to save billions of dollars.

Brian has also held positions at other federal agencies. These include working on sensitive intelligence issues at the U.S. Department of Defense, managing complex domestic and worldwide operations in the office of the Vice President at the White House, and serving in the office of the Commissioner at the U.S. Social Security Administration.

Small business is the backbone of the American economy, and Brian has worked with his wife and father in multiple small, family-run businesses in Texas. He has also worked as an independent consultant for various clients, as a director at a public affairs firm helping oversee their healthcare portfolio, and is an alumni of the American Council on Germany’s Young Leaders program.

Within hours of being sworn-in to the Texas legislature in October of 2021, Brian authored HB 168, the Texas COVID Vaccine Freedom Act, to comprehensively ban all forced COVID vaccinations in Texas. A regular guest on national television, Brian is a leader in the fight to protect liberty against tyrannical, big-government policies that harm Texans.

Brian is a proud member of the fightin’ Texas Aggie class of 2004, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and also studied Business Administration and Political Science. He is an instrument-rated private pilot who lives in Ellis County, TX with his wife, Tara, and their four children.
