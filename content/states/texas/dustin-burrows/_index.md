State Representative Dustin Burrows was first elected to serve House District 83 in 2014. Dustin currently chairs the House Calendars Committee. Additionally, he is a member of the House Committee on Elections and the House Committee on Higher Education.

Dustin was born in Lubbock and attended Monterey High School. At Monterey, he was involved with FFA, showed pigs and judged livestock.

After graduating high school, Dustin went to Rhodes College where he studied economics. From his studies, Dustin developed a deep appreciation for the market. One of his favorite professors started a class by explaining that the key to understanding public economics is recognizing that “Anything the government does is twice as costly and half as effective as what the private sector can do.”

After graduating from Rhodes, Dustin was anxious to get back to West Texas. He moved home in 2001 and graduated from the Texas Tech School of Law and the Rawls College of Business with a J.D. and M.B.A. in 2004. Dustin is a small business owner, practicing law at the Burrows Law Firm in Lubbock.

Dustin has had the opportunity to represent individuals and small businesses engaged in a variety of industries. Currently, most of his practice is devoted to representing agricultural producers in Gaines, Terry, Lynn and Lubbock counties. Dustin has learned that people in all walks of life strive to be lawful members of society; however, the sheer volume and complexity of the laws create a high hurdle to living a lawful and regulatory-compliant life. Dustin believes we need fewer laws, not more, and that the Texas legislature should work to repeal and simplify our overburdening laws.

Dustin is married to Elisabeth, who grew up in South Texas in a family involved with cattle ranching and oil & gas. They are the proud parents of three boys, Davis, Whitby and Henry.
