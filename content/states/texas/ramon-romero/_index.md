State Representative Ramón Romero, Jr. is proudly serving in his fifth term representing the people of House District 90 in Fort Worth, Texas. Rep. Romero is currently serving on the House Committee on Transportation and the House Committee on Urban Affairs.

Through his involvement as a neighborhood representative working with the Fort Worth City Council, he formed long-lasting relationships and was appointed to the Fort Worth Zoning Commission and chair of the Fort Worth Planning Commission during a period that saw Fort Worth’s largest increase in size and population. These collective experiences fostered his passion for public service, which led to a close loss in a run for Fort Worth City Council in 2012. Still determined to serve his community in public office, he ran again in 2014, this time for State Representative in House District 90.

He won the Democratic Primary for House District 90 in Fort Worth against an 18-year incumbent, becoming the first Hispanic State Representative in Tarrant County history. During his first term as State Representative, Romero was awarded 'Democrat Freshman of the Year' by his peers after a highly successful legislative session. He was a champion in fighting for important legislation cracking down on human trafficking, raising standards for county jails, and advocating for mental health awareness and care.

Since his first session, Rep. Romero has passed many bills into law surrounding issues of mental health access, immigrants' rights, combating human trafficking, and increasing government transparency. During his time in the Texas Legislature, he has served in a diverse set of Committees including Business & Industry, County Affairs, Veterans' Affairs, Corrections, Insurance, and International Relations & Economic Development.

Representative Romero is a lifelong resident of Fort Worth, Texas, and still lives in the East Fort Worth neighborhood he grew up in. He is the father of four children: Lindsay, Lauren, Giovanni, and Ramon, and a proud grandfather to three grandchildren. In his early 20’s, he started his pool business, A-Fast Tile & Coping. By age 25, A-Fast had over 60 employees, many from his neighborhood. To this day, Representative Romero still owns A-Fast Tile & Coping and Stone Mason Supply.

Representative Romero is a well-respected father, businessman, and community leader who believes that success is measured not by how much you have received, but by how much you have given.
