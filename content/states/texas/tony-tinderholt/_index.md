State Representative Tony Tinderholt is a father, retired combat veteran, and conservative Republican from House District 94. He is serving his fifth term in the Texas Legislature, representing the people of Arlington, Dalworthington Gardens, Pantego, Fort Worth, Hurst, Euless, and Bedford in Tarrant County. Tinderholt serves on the Committee on Public Health as well as the Committee on County Affairs.

Tinderholt has been named as the most fiscally conservative House legislator by Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, a “Faith & Family Champion” by Texas Values, a “Courageous Conservative” by Texas Conservative Coalition, and tied for the top score on Texas Family Project’s legislator scorecard. Many education, business, pro-life, transportation, public safety, and gun rights groups have also recognized his leadership.

He is the proud father to his four children (Kayley, Nathan, Tyler, & Brenan) and grandfather of two (Jaxon & Vanellope). He is happily married to his wife, Bethany, a loving mother, Executive Director of the Arlington Police Foundation, and former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader.

Before his state service, Tinderholt had a decorated military career. He entered active duty Air Force in 1988 as a Spanish Cryptologic Linguist, taking part in counter drug missions throughout South and Central America. Following 9/11, he re-entered military service, this time in the Army. Tinderholt worked as a platoon leader, executive officer, detachment commander, and recruiting commander, and volunteered to deploy to multiple combat zones. At one point, he oversaw an $836 million budget and managed a team of over 400. In his 21 years in the armed forces, Major (Ret.) Tinderholt served tours across several continents, earning awards to include the Bronze Star Medal and Combat Action Badge.

In civilian life, Tinderholt previously served as a Spanish professor and holds a Master’s Degree in Educational Leadership. He currently employs dozens of Texans as a business owner in the Metroplex.

The Tinderholt family is very active in their community. They have served alongside a variety of organizations including Spirit of Hope Arlington, Catholic Charities of Fort Worth, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, St. Jude Medical Center, and the Arlington Police Foundation.

Tony is Lutheran, and his family attends St. Vincent De Paul Catholic Church in Southwest Arlington.
