Rep. Angelia Orr is currently serving her first term as State Representative for House District 13. This new House District includes Hill, Bosque, Falls, Limestone, Freestone, Leon and a portion of McLennan Counties. Angelia is a wife, mother and small business owner. She and her husband, Will, live in Hill County where his family has farmed and ranched since 1872. They have two grown children, attend First Baptist Church Hillsboro, and run several successful small businesses.

A 1992 graduate of Texas A&M University, Angelia has dedicated her life to raising her family and serving her community. A former substitute teacher and strong advocate for local public schools, Angelia was elected to the Itasca School Board in 2007 and went on to serve two terms as secretary. In 2010, she decided to run for District Clerk in Hill County, winning a competitive, three-person primary before defeating a five-term incumbent.

After the Texas Legislature completed redistricting in 2021, Angelia was encouraged by local residents and community leaders to run in the newly formed House District 13. As State Representative, Angelia is committed to being a strong voice and advocate for rural Texas. During the 88th Legislative Session, Rep. Orr serves on the Appropriations, County Affairs and House Administration Committees.
