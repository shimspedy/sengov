Senator Morgan LaMantia was elected to the Texas Senate in November 2022 to represent the newly drawn Senate District 27, which spans eight counties and runs along the Gulf Coast from the border of Mexico to the Coastal Bend, and includes three ports, a space port, Padre Island, oil and gas industries, wind farms, agricultural farms, and thousands of acres of ranch land.

A Valley native and sixth generation Texan, Senator LaMantia is part of the next generation of leadership in her family business that supports over 1,200 jobs across Texas and beyond. Currently, Senator LaMantia heads up data analytics and serves as In-House Counsel for L&F Distributors, carrying on the legacy of her grandfather by building opportunities through hard work and giving back to the community.

Today, Senator LaMantia is stepping up to provide the next generation of leadership for South Texas as one of the newest members in the Texas Senate. Her priorities include expanding access to affordable health care, standing by our teachers and public schools, supporting rural communities, and encouraging small businesses through workforce development.

In her downtime, Senator LaMantia enjoys spending time with her loving family and her five amusing dogs.
