Angie Chen Button is currently serving as State Representative for House District 112 which includes portions of Garland, Richardson, Rowlett, Sachse, and Dallas in Dallas County. She currently serves as Chair of the International Relations and Economic Development Committee and as a member of the Ways and Means Committee.

Representative Button worked for Texas Instruments (TI) where she promoted American products internationally as an International Marketing Manager. She is also a CPA with Masters’ degrees in Public Finance and Management Sciences.

Before her election to the Texas House, Rep. Button had a long record of public service and community involvement in the Metroplex. She was a member of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) Board and an Executive Committee Member of the Dallas Regional Mobility Coalition (DRMC). She served in leadership positions with chambers of commerce, citizen coalitions, and for other civic and non-profit organizations. She has also been part of the Dallas Assembly, the Dallas Summit, and the Women’s Museum Advisory Board.

Representative Button was born in Taipei, Taiwan. As a child, her seven person family lived in a 300 square foot, one-room hut without a kitchen or running water. She credits education with bringing her a better life. Rep. Button met her husband Darcy as a graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). They have lived in Richardson and Garland for 30 years and are the proud grandparents of two. Angie’s life has been the American dream-Texas style.
