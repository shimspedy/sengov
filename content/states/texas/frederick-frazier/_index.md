Frederick Frazier is a native Texan and attended the University of Texas at San Antonio. He has been an active officer for the past 27 years and a special deputy US Marshal the past 15 years.

Frazier was elected as the state representative for House District 61 in 2022 and represents McKinney, Anna, Celina, Frisco, Melissa, Prosper, and Frisco in Collin County. Frazier is the first active-duty officer to preside in the Texas House of Representatives.

Frazier has received numerous awards for his service as an active officer, including being named one of the nation’s ‘Top Cops’ for extraordinary service, along with the medal of valor, life-saving award, and numerous commendations for professionalism, team effort, dedication, and hard work.

In 2017, Frazier established the Texas Law Enforcement Committee (TLEC) to work closely with law enforcement officials across the state and provide guidance on law enforcement issues. During his chairmanship, he led the efforts on behalf of law enforcement to secure bills on improved vests for officers, anti-defunding police, and tuition reimbursement.

Frazier served on the McKinney City Council At Large Place 2 position for three years. Notable accomplishments during Frazier’s term include lowered tax rate every year on council, doubled the budget for first responders and secured 7-year contracts saving the taxpayers money over the long term, turned the airport profitable, fought to keep public spaces open during covid, and maintained the national rating for one of the safest cities in America.

In 2020, Frazier was appointed by President Trump to his Commission on Law Enforcement, the first of its kind since Lyndon B. Johnson was president. Notably, he was the only commissioner appointed from the state of Texas.

Frazier and his wife Tracie have lived in Collin County for over 20 years. They have two daughters and one son, and they attend public schools in McKinney. Frederick strongly believes giving back to the community is just as important as working hard in your career. He actively volunteers his time and resources to help support the efforts of his community through Collin County CASA, Children’s Advocacy Center of Collin County, veterans and first responders’ organizations, and area school fundraisers and booster clubs. The Frazier family are members of St. Gabriel’s Church in McKinney and Frederick volunteers his time as a member of the Knights of Columbus.
