Reggie Smith was elected as the state representative for House District 62 in 2018. He represents Delta, Fannin, and Grayson Counties. He serves on the Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence, the General Investigating, and the Public Health Committees.

In 1991, Smith received his B.S. in Political Science from Austin College in Sherman, Texas and was a member of the Pi Gamma Mu Honor Society. In 1994 he earned his law degree from South Texas College of Law in Houston and was admitted to the State Bar of Texas. Upon graduation, he returned home to practice law. Smith is licensed to practice in Texas, and admitted to practice in federal court including the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Texas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

Smith is the founder and owner of Reginald B. Smith, Jr. PLLC, a general practice law firm. Prior to his election, he served as a two-term chairman of the Grayson County (party) and the Northern Regional Director of the Texas (party) County Chairman’s Association.

Smith has been active in various local charitable and service organizations. He has previously served on the board of directors of Big Brother Big Sisters, Friends of Scouting with the Texoma Valley Boy Scouts and The Rehab Center. He has coached little league teams and devoted much of his off time to raising their three children with his wife Stephany.
During his first term in the legislature he served on the House Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for drafting the state’s biennial budget. He also served on the Committee on Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence. Throughout his time in the legislature, Smith has established himself as an advocate for conservative principles: protecting the unborn; lowering taxes; safeguarding second amendment rights; promoting individual liberty; and supporting our schools and teachers.

Smith and his family reside in Van Alstyne, Texas and are active members of the First Baptist Church of Van Alstyne.
