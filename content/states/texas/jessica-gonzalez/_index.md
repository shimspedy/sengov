Jessica González is currently serving her third term as State Representative for House District 104.

Jessica has dedicated her time in the Texas House of Representatives to expanding voting rights, protecting the civil rights of LGBTQ+ Texans, reforming our criminal justice system, and increasing access to affordable housing.

Jessica serves as a member of the House Committee on Business & Industry, a member of the House Committee on Urban Affairs, Vice-Chair of the Texas House LGBTQ+ Caucus, and Chair of the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators Human and Civil Rights Task Force.

Jessica earned her Bachelor of Arts in Criminology and Criminal Justice from The University of Texas at Arlington. She later attended Western Michigan University-Cooley School of Law, where she held top student leadership positions, clerked at the Voting Rights Section of the Civil Rights Division for the U.S. Department of Justice, and graduated at the top of her class.

In 2011, Jessica was selected as a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Law Graduate Fellow in Washington, D.C. She served as a Legislative Assistant in the U.S. House of Representatives, handling an extensive policy portfolio. She was also selected as a White House intern, where she worked on immigration-related issues.

Jessica’s white paper titled “New State Voting Laws: A Barrier to the Latino Vote?” earned her a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition for her dedication to addressing current public policy concerns. Her commitment to protecting the rights of voters led to her service as the Nevada Voter Protection Director for President Obama’s re-election campaign in 2012.

Today, Jessica practices personal injury at her law firm, Gandara & González, PLLC, located in House District 104.

Jessica uses her diverse educational, professional, and policy experience to fight for the residents of House District 104 and all Texans. During the 87th Legislative Session, she was recognized as Texas Monthly’s Bull of the Brazos, received the Matt Garcia Public Service Award from the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and was named one of USA TODAY’s Women of the Year.
