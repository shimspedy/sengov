Ana-Maria Ramos is the current House District 102 State Representative and was elected into office in November of 2018. She successfully flipped a Republican-held seat and won with 52.9% of constituent votes. She was re-elected in November of 2020, winning 53.9% of constituent votes against her Republican challenger. Since assuming office, Representative Ramos has been a fierce advocate for voting, LGBTQIA+, immigrant, and women’s rights. She has fought back against gerrymandering and promotes civic engagement in her community. Representative Ramos has sat on the Defense & Veterans' Affairs, Natural Resources, and Juvenile Justice & Family Issues Committees during her time in office.

A Dallas native, she is a wife, mother of two, and daughter of immigrants. After having her first child at the age of fifteen and dropping out of school, she learned how to advocate for herself early on in life. Against all odds, Ana-Maria returned to school and obtained her GED from Dallas Can Academy. She continued her educational career by enrolling at Eastfield Community College where she received an Associate's degree. One step closer to having a Bachelor's degree, Ana-Maria enrolled at the University of Texas- Arlington and studied Communications.

After fostering a love for education through obtaining her BA, Ana-Maria enrolled at the Texas Women's University in 2005 and received a Master’s degree in Business Administration. Shortly after, she enrolled at Southern Methodist University and worked towards getting a Juris Doctorate in hopes of using her law degree to positively impact her community. She currently owns Ramos Law PLLC based in Dallas, Texas and is a practicing Attorney at Law.

For the last twenty years, Ana-Maria has worked closely with members of her community on revitalization projects and public health/safety programs. She has obtained grants to help local underprivileged individuals with home improvements and crime reduction measures. Additionally, she has helped increase access to higher education in her community by heading the development of a new campus of El Centro Community College where she acted as the first
Executive Director.

Representative Ramos is committed to protecting marginalized groups and working class families by staying true to progressive values. She is passionate about improving the lives of ALL Texans by investing in public education, providing access to affordable healthcare, and advocating for property tax reform. She remains focused on passing sensible gun legislation aimed at reducing violence, fighting for women’s rights, and protecting voting rights.
