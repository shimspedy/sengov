Nate Schatzline, an American politician and former Christian pastor, is currently serving as a representative in the Texas House of Representatives from District 93. Hailing from Fort Worth, Texas, Schatzline brings a unique blend of pastoral and civic experience to his role in public service.

Schatzline serves as the director of operations for The Justice Reform, a notable anti-human trafficking nonprofit operating under the umbrella of Mercy Culture Church in Fort Worth. His commitment to justice and community welfare is evident in his work with this organization.

A member of the Republican Party, Schatzline entered the political arena and secured victory in the 2022 Texas House of Representatives election, triumphing over Democrat KC Chowdhury in District 93. His campaign focused on Christian conservative values, advocating for border security, law enforcement, and tax reduction. Schatzline's positions include support for looser gun laws, restrictions on abortion (with exceptions for maternal life), and opposition to "critical race theory."

Within the Texas House of Representatives, Schatzline actively contributes to key committees, including county affairs and criminal jurisprudence.

In 2023, Schatzline stirred controversy by authoring bill HB 1266, aimed at restricting drag performances by amending the Texas business and commerce code. This move sparked discussions, especially as a video surfaced showing Schatzline dressed in drag during his student years.

On May 27, 2023, Schatzline voted against the impeachment of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, showcasing his stance on a pivotal issue within the state's political landscape. This decision further highlights his position within the political and social spheres.g hundreds of at-risk students in multiple cities, and teaching students that they are not the product of their environment, but that they were born on purpose with a purpose.
