Born in Pakistan to a large family, Representative Salman Bhojani immigrated to Texas as a teenager. He worked three minimum wage jobs to help support his familyâ€“climbing the ladder from convenience store cashier to successful business owner, attorney, Euless City Councilman, and Mayor Pro Tem. After becoming a naturalized citizen, Rep. Bhojani earned degrees from the University of Texas at Dallas, Southern Methodist University, and Oxford University.

After finding a home in Euless with his young family, Rep. Bhojani made national headlines when he was elected to the Euless City Council, becoming the first person of color to hold elected office in Euless. In 2023, Rep. Bhojani was sworn in as one of the first Muslims and the first South Asians to serve in the Texas Legislature and is the first person of color ever elected to represent House District 92.

Rep. Bhojani serves on the House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence and the House Committee on Pensions, Investments, and Financial Services. He also serves as the Chairman of the Criminal Procedure Subcommittee on the House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence.

Rep. Bhojani is proud to call Texas home. He lives in Euless with his wife, Nima, and his children, Aarish and Raisha. He enjoys traveling, running, hiking, playing ping pong, and spending time with his family.
