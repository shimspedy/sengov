Representative Mihaela Plesa is a lifelong Texan who is proud to serve the residents of Texas House District 70, which covers portions of Dallas, Plano, Richardson, and Allen. She is the first-generation daughter of Romanian immigrants who fled Soviet communism to pursue the American Dream.

Rep. Mihaela Plesa owned and operated her own small business in fashion merchandising and design, focusing on Texas-made products, while helping other entrepreneurs start and grow their own small businesses. Ultimately, she felt compelled to serve her community in a more meaningful way and sold her successful business to pursue a legislative career. Before running for the Texas House, Plesa served as a legislative director for three regular sessions, four special sessions, including redistricting during 2021. During her tenure as a legislative director, Plesa worked to pass legislation that expanded the Texas’ Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force, expanded medicaid to Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), and passed a constitutional amendment that was overwhelmingly ratified by the voters to deliver property tax exemptions to gold star families (Prop. 8, 2021). Representative Mihaela Plesa is proud to stand on her legislative record of bipartisan achievements for the people of Texas.

During the 88th Legislative Session Representative Plesa’s top legislative priorities include increasing public school funding, reducing property taxes, addressing recapture that siphons millions of dollars from Plano ISD, economic development that uplifts small businesses and hardworking families, and making childcare affordable.

Rep. Plesa is the proud product of Texas public schools. She earned her diploma from Newman Smith High School, a bachelor’s degree from the University of North Texas, and a master’s degree from Southern Methodist University. Representative Plesa is proud to be the first democratic woman elected to represent Collin County in the Texas Legislature, and the first Romanian-American elected in the great state of Texas.
