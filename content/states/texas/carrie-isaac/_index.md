True to her Texas roots, Representative Carrie Isaac’s commitment to service began early. One of her core beliefs is that nonprofits and churches serve those in need more effectively than the government. She has a long history of service in organizations making a positive difference in the lives of her neighbors. Prior to being elected to the Texas House, Representative Isaac worked with a variety of nonprofits that advocate to remove barriers and provide opportunities to promote prosperity, provide communities with a framework of compassionate care designed to assist neighbors in time of need, and focused on dramatically improving the landscape of health and wellness to help Texas residents thrive.

Representative Isaac came from humble roots. After her father served in the Air Force, he worked as a welder and stainless steel worker for nearly 40 years. Watching his work ethic taught her the importance of a limited government and a low tax burden so that families can keep more of their hard-earned dollars.

Representative Isaac may not have had a lot of material things growing up, but her parents gave her something invaluable. They made sure she knew God’s word. She has a strong moral compass. She will stand strong when others might waver because her faith is stronger than her fears and she knows who she answers to.

A first-generation college graduate, Representative Isaac embodies the American Dream. She worked and borrowed her way through college. She graduated cum laude from Stephen F. Austin State University with a Bachelor of Science and later earned a Master of Science from Purdue University Global. Through hard work, a “never quit” attitude, and perseverance, she has risen above her circumstances. She brings real-life experience to the office. She is totally committed to fighting skyrocketing property taxes, supporting reliable Texas energy, ensuring that every child in Texas receives a high-quality public education, securing our elections, and securing the border to keep our communities safe.

Representative Isaac has been a Republican leader in Hays County for many years. She is a founding member of Hays County Republican Women and has proudly served as a delegate to the Republican Party of Texas State Convention many times.

During college, she met the love of her life and husband of 22 years, Jason Isaac. They have two sons, Aidan (20) and Landon (18). Her proudest accomplishment is raising two strong, independent, faith-driven young men.

Carrie is an avid hunter, outdoorswoman and accomplished athlete. She completed a full-length 140.6-mile IRONMAN. She has the mental toughness and endurance to fight for our freedoms and values in the Texas House.
