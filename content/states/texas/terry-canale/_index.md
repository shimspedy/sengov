Texas State Representative Canales was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012 to represent District 40, which encompasses the heart of Hidalgo County. The cities within District 40 include Edinburg (Hidalgo County Seat), Elsa, North Pharr, San Carlos, La Blanca, Faysville, and portions of McAllen and Weslaco.

In 2021, Representative Terry Canales was re-appointed by Texas Speaker of the House Dade Phelan to serve as Chairman of the powerful House Transportation Committee, the first Latino to hold that position. This is Chairman Canales' second consecutive session chairing the committee. As the Chair of the House Transportation Committee, Canales oversees Texas' highways, airways, waterways, and railways, which are vital to the economic prosperity of the fastest growing state in the nation. Chairman Canales also serves on the International Relations & Economic Development Committee.

In his time in the legislature, Chairman Canales has focused on transparency and open government, passing several pieces of legislation to ensure the public's right to know how their hard-earned tax dollars are spent as well as the right to have their voice heard at local governmental meetings. Canales has a long history of fighting for our public schools, our current and retired teachers, and ensuring that our students are given an equal opportunity to succeed. Representative Canales has also been a leader on criminal justice reform, filing and passing legislation aimed at eliminating our modern-day debtor's prison system and fighting to ensure our state resources are being utilized efficiently.

Chairman Canales completed his Bachelor's Degree at the University of The Incarnate Word and his law degree at St. Mary's School of Law. Upon passage of the Texas State Bar Exam, Rep. Canales opened his own law practice in Edinburg, Texas, where he lives with his wife, Erica E. Canales, and is raising five children: Juliana, Terry Andres, Caleb Ezra, Trigo, and Catalina.
