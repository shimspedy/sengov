Angela Paxton was elected to the Texas Senate in November of 2018 and represents fast-growing Senate District 8, a district that is home to professional sports headquarters, dozens of Fortune 1000 companies, countless entrepreneurs and small businesses, top-rated public schools, and is joined by rural communities to the east that feature Texas charm and recreation. A secondary math teacher and school counselor for more than 20 years, she is the first educator elected to the Texas Senate in over two decades. Senator Paxton describes her job in three words: Listen. Learn. Lead.

Senator Paxton is an adopted child and the first person in her family to graduate from college. She earned an undergraduate degree in Mathematical Science from Baylor University and a Master of Science in Education from the University of Houston-Clear Lake.

Senator Paxton leverages her expertise as an educator, interest in technology, experience as a small business owner, and deep roots in Senate District 8 to advocate for her constituents and lead on policy that elevates educational and economic opportunity and human dignity.

Senator Paxton currently serves as the Vice Chair of the State Affairs Committee and as member of the Senate committees for Finance, Education, Local Government, and Nominations. She is also the Chair of the Senate Republican Caucus, where she works with the other Republican Senators to advance our conservative priorities.

Senator Paxton and her husband, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, met as students at Baylor University and have been married since 1986. They have four grown children and three grandchildren, and are members of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano.
