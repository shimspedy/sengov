Representative Sam Harless has been a resident of Northwest Harris County since 1976. He was a 1981 Spring High School graduate and went to Lone Star College before attending Sam Houston State University.

Sam started working at the age of 14 mowing lawns and later became a successful small business owner. Today, he and his wife Patricia own Fred Fincher Motors, a second-generation independent automobile dealership.

Sam actively gives back to his community by supporting The Pearl Fincher Museum of Fine Arts, Northwest Assistance Ministries, The Centrum Arts League, Klein Educational Foundation, and Cy-Fair ISD Educational Foundation. Sam touts the Fallen Warrior Memorial and Fallen Warrior Art Gallery as jewels of the community and a strong tribute to our fallen heroes.

As a strong law enforcement supporter he has served for many years on the Harris County Constable's Precinct 4 Training Advisory Board as well as the Harris County Sheriff Training Advisory Board, where he assists with community input on law enforcement training.

Sam married Patricia Fincher in 1985 and have a son, younger Sam, who is a graduate of Klein High School and North Texas State University. They are active members of Champion Forest Baptist Church. Patricia served in the Texas House representing the same District from 2007 â€“ 2016. In May of 2022, Sam and Patricia welcomed a new addition to the family with the arrival of their first grandchild, Karsyn Pearl Harless.

In the 88th Session, Representative Harless is serving on five of the House of Representative's designated committees. Now Chairman Harless, Sam was picked by House Speaker Dade Phelan to chair the Select Committee on Health Care Reform, in addition to Homeland Public Safety, the Select Committee on Community Safety, House Administration, and Licensing and Administrative Procedures. He also serves on the board of Lone Star College. By the end of the 87th Session, Representative Harless was directly involved with 134 pieces of legislation.
