Newly-elected to serve in the 88th Texas Legislature, State Representative Josey Garcia is the 1st woman, active-duty veteran to serve in the Texas House. She represents West San Antonio’s House District 124.

Representative Garcia has committed her life to serving others, her lived-experiences guiding her quest for solutions to increase opportunities for all Texans. Josey spent her early years bouncing from one foster home to another. By the time she reached high school, she had attended 13 schools and lived with various families. At the age of 16, she signed up for the Delay Enlistment Program, securing her place in the U.S. Air Force, serving in deployments to Cameroon, Africa and Iraq, where she served in Operation Iraqi Freedom. After Ramstein Air Base, Germany, Representative Garcia was stationed at Lackland Air Force Base in 2001. Here she would retire after 20 years of a military career. An active member of her westside community, Josey made San Antonio, Texas her forever home.

Upon her retirement in 2014, Josey became a published author and community advocate in San Antonio. In 2020, she co-founded Uniting America Outreach, a nonprofit that delivers food and supplies to people in need. During Winter Storm Uri in 2021, Uniting America Outreach delivered over 9,000 meals to San Antonio’s most vulnerable residents. Her organization raised over $50,000 to provide food, clothing, and hygiene products, which they took directly to Ciudad Acuña, Mexico during the 2022 crisis at the border.

Josey is happily married to her husband Ramon, an Army veteran who served in both Operation Iraqi Freedom, Iraq and Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan, where he was awarded a Purple Heart when he was shot during a combat mission. Their blended family consists of eight children, including two adult sons on the autism spectrum.

As Texas State Representative for HD 124, Rep. Garcia will continue advocating for those who need her most! Our veterans, children impacted by the foster care industry, retirees, and working families who desperately need access to better paying jobs and affordable housing.
