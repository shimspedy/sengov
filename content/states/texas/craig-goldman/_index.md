Craig Goldman won election to serve his first term as Texas State Representative in November of 2012. He represents District 97, which encompasses southwest Tarrant County. Before taking office, Representative Goldman experienced a career in both business and political fields. For nearly a decade, he and his father ran a retail gourmet food and fine wine store in Fort Worth, and he has worked on campaigns helping to elect officeholders at the local, state, and national levels.

Representative Goldman's extremely proud of his Texas roots as a 5th-generation Texan and a 4th-generation native of Fort Worth. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Texas in Austin and is a partner in several real estate investment companies.

In December of 2019, he was appointed to serve on the Sunset Advisory Commission. The appointment is two terms, or four years, and will expire in 2023. Representative Goldman currently serves as Chairman of the House Committee on Energy Resources and is a member of the House Committees on Licensing and Administrative Procedures and Redistricting.
