State Representative Brooks Landgraf proudly serves his fellow West Texans across Andrews, Ector, Ward and Winkler counties in the Texas House of Representatives. Representative Landgraf is chairman of the House Environmental Regulation Committee, and serves as a member of the House Transportation Committee, the House Redistricting Committee, and the House Administration Committee.

Landgraf is a native son of Odessa. His family has been ranching in West Texas for five generations, and Brooks is active in managing the family's business and ranching operations. Brooks is also an experienced business attorney who has worked in the oil and gas and healthcare industries.

Brooks has served the people of District 81 in the Texas House of Representatives since 2015. He quickly became known for his commitment to West Texas, his strong work ethic and his fierce advocacy for practical, conservative solutions. Brooks has fought to improve highways and schools in West Texas while also working to repeal burdensome regulations that harm the Permian Basin's oil and gas industry.

Governor Greg Abbott has praised Brooks for his "tireless efforts" in the Texas Legislature, calling him "a proven conservative leader and a strong voice for the people of West Texas."

A Permian High School alum, Brooks graduated from Texas A&M University, where he received U.S. Army training in the Corps of Cadets. Landgraf then earned his law degree from the St. Mary's School of Law in San Antonio, where he also served as the editor-in-chief of the law review.

Brooks is a proud Eagle Scout and is dedicated to serving the state and community that have given him so many opportunities. Following law school, Brooks immediately returned home to West Texas and represented energy producers and other local businesses while working in private practice. Brooks was named volunteer of the year by Legal Aid for his pro bono efforts. In 2017, Brooks was named to the inaugural class of "Odessa Under 40" by the Young Professionals of Odessa.

Brooks and his wife, Shelby, whose family is from Andrews, have one daughter, Hollis Rose, and are proud to call West Texas their home. They enjoy volunteering together for local charities, and the family loves spending time together working on the family cattle ranch. They attend church at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton in Odessa.
