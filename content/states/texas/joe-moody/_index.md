Joe Moody represents Texas’s District 78, a mixed urban and rural district covering much of northern El Paso County. He currently serves as Speaker Pro Tempore of the Texas House, as Vice Chair of the Calendars Committee, and as a member of the committees on, Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence, and Redistricting.

Joe is a lifelong El Pasoan and has followed the example of public service set by his father, District Judge William Moody, and his mother, El Paso school teacher Magdalena Morales-Moody. Joe was married to Adrianne Riley in 2011. They have two young sons: William and Preston.

Joe grew up in politics and became actively involved in campaigns at a young age. In 2008, he decided to take on the challenge himself and entered a Texas House race which proved to be one of the most hotly contested statewide. His election at age 27 made him the youngest state representative in Texas.

Although Joe’s legislative work has touched on topics from veterans issues and mental health to education and equality, Joe’s passion has been criminal justice reform. He’s devoted particular attention to preventing wrongful convictions, promoting diversion and reintegration, and improving both access to justice and indigent defense outcomes. Joe has also filled critical gaps in our laws on domestic violence, stalking, human trafficking, and sexual assault.

Joe’s work has earned him numerous accolades, including awards from the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute, and Equality Texas. He was also named one of Texas Monthly’s top 10 legislators after back to back legislative sessions in 2017 & 2019.

Outside of the Texas Legislature, Joe is an attorney. He served as a prosecutor for many years at the El Paso County District Attorney’s Office before entering private practice. Joe is currently working for West Star Bank, a local El Paso bank where he advises on regulatory and compliance issues as Senior Counsel.
