State Representative Four Price, a fourth generation Texan from Amarillo, has the privilege of serving as the results-oriented voice for constituents residing in eight Texas Panhandle counties – Carson, Hansford, Hutchinson, Lipscomb, Moore, Ochiltree, Potter, and Sherman. In 2022, Price was re-elected to a seventh term in the Texas House of Representatives where he continues to vigorously advocate for the betterment of the Texas Panhandle and the entire Lone Star State.

Representative Price serves on the House Natural Resources Committee, the House Public Health Committee, and the House Select Committee on Health Care Reform. These committees provide Representative Price with additional leadership opportunities to help influence and shape significant public policy on numerous matters directly impacting the well-being of Texans daily – the sustainability of a reliable water supply and the delivery of healthcare services, including mental health.

Price believes that access to quality healthcare and clean water, along with sound public education and higher education opportunities, are foundational to the quality of life and prosperity of individual Texans and their communities. He further believes that these essentials are vital to the economic viability and long-term sustainability of rural Texas.

In addition to working on health care and water policy matters, Price has also championed legislation on brain injury prevention and rehabilitation, access to and the delivery of mental health services, and enhancing the state’s and region’s infrastructure including broadband and telemedicine/telehealth access.

During the 2021 Regular Legislative Session, Price authored and passed into law significant legislation regarding telemedicine and telehealth, House Bill 4, and the further strengthening of mental health parity through House Bill 2595. Also, Price helped shape the future of broadband infrastructure in Texas as one of four joint authors of House Bill 5. Additionally, he was the House sponsor of Senate Bill 1474, which could aid in the further development of Interstate 27 in Texas.
