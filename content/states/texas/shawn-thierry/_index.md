With a continued record of shattering glass ceilings, State Representative Shawn Thierry is the first, and only, woman to serve in the historic Texas House District 146 seat. She is an alumna of Howard University and Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University. Representative Thierry has been a licensed attorney for 27 years and is a principal at Hardwick Law Firm, LLC, practicing in the area of public finance.

Serving in her fourth term at the Texas Legislature, Rep. Thierry is Vice-Chair of the influential House Ways and Means Committee and was recently appointed to the House Energy Resources Committee. She is regarded as a “voice for the voiceless” and is credited nationally for raising awareness on the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis, including its disproportionate impact on women of color.

Affectionally described as a "policy powerhouse", Rep. Thierry has authored over 80 bills, tackling a range of issues including: school safety, human trafficking, mental health, and maternal care. She successfully renamed part of State Highway 288 after her childhood hero, the late Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. Rep. Thierry formally unveiled The “Barbara Jordan Memorial Parkway” before the Houston community on March 8, 2022.

Representative Shawn Thierry is honored to be named one of the Top 30 Most Influential Women in Houston.
