During the 88th Texas Legislature, Dr. Gary VanDeaver will be serving his fifth term as the state Representative for Texas House District 1 which includes Bowie, Cass, Lamar, Morris and Red River counties. Rep. VanDeaver has served on the House Committee on Appropriations and the House Committee on Public Education beginning with his first term in 2015. Rep. VanDeaver looks forward to continuing to work with his legislative colleagues and the leadership on behalf of his constituents in House District 1 during the 2023 legislative session.

Raised on a small family cattle operation near Clarksville, Texas, in Red River County, Gary learned the importance of a strong work ethic, a love for the land, and faith in God from an early age. Traditional values and a commitment to service continue to drive Gary in his daily work on behalf of the families and communities of his district.

Inspired by a deep-seated belief in serving others and investing in our rising generation, Gary embarked on a 33-year career as an educator. After beginning his career as a vocational agriculture teacher, he became a school principal and completed a Doctorate in Educational Administration. He most recently served as Superintendent of New Boston Independent School District before his initial election to the Texas House in 2014.

In his previous sessions, Gary has helped draft responsible state budgets that held overall state spending below the rate of inflation and population growth. In his previous sessions, Gary has passed several pieces of legislation specifically for interests in House District 1 including bills relating to the election of trustees for Paris Junior College; appointment of bailiffs in Bowie County courts; additional powers for TexAmericas Center; and numerous public education bills.  Rep. VanDeaver has already introduced several bills for consideration during the 87th session that are also based on needs of or ideas from his constituents including allowing honorably retired peace officers to purchase uniforms so they can be buried in those uniforms; preventing employment discrimination against volunteer first responders; and requesting an interim study relating to making the Northeast Texas Trail (NETT) a part of the state park system.

Gary and his wife, Pamela, have been married for 37 years. Their two grown daughters carry on the family tradition of public service as a schoolteacher and criminal prosecutor. In 2016, the VanDeavers welcomed their first granddaughter, and a second granddaughter joined the family in August 2018. Locally, Gary is involved with the Chamber of Commerce and Lions Club, having served as president of both. He also served on the Board of Directors of the Texas FFA, Red River County Farm Bureau, Bogata Rodeo Association, and Red River County Fair Association. The VanDeavers are members of the First Baptist Church of New Boston, where Gary serves as a deacon and teaches adult Sunday school.
