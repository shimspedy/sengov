Since 2017, Jay Dean has served as State Representative for House District 7 in East Texas. From when he was elected until 2022, House District 7 included Gregg and Upshur Counties. As of 2023, the district includes Gregg, Harrison, and Marion Counties.

Before serving in the State House, Jay served as Mayor of Longview for a decade and on the Longview City Council for 5 years prior to that. Under his leadership, Forbes Magazine recognized Longview as one of the "best places for business" and it was ranked one of the top 10 U.S. cities for economic growth.

A lifelong conservative, Jay is a strong advocate for cutting the size of government, responsible budgeting, creating business-friendly environments that support job creation and economic development, and low tax rates, as well as strengthening public education and workforce training, supporting the right to life, and protecting the 2nd Amendment.

In addition to his public service, Jay has also been a successful small business owner and executive in the oil & gas field services industry. Having previously run his own business, Jay now serves as General Manager for Thomas Oilfield Services. Jay is a proud graduate of Louisiana State University and resides in Longview with his wife Pokie, where they raised their three daughters and helped found their church, St. Matthew's.
