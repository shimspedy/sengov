From a blue-collar home in rural Texas to representing one of the fastest growing areas in the United States, Jared Patterson found purpose during the tragic events of 9/11 and has since dedicated himself to a life of service to his community and to his profession.

A proud graduate of Texas A&M University, Jared was first elected to Texas House District 106, which covers north-central and eastern Denton County, in 2018. He is a full-spectrum conservative who champions fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, life, and the fierce spirit of independence which has made Texas the greatest state in the nation.

During his time in the Legislature, Rep. Patterson has been an author on legislation to increase border security funding, lower property taxes, support first responders, and protect children from radical indoctrination. He has also backed efforts to increase teacher pay, safeguard our pets and reform the criminal justice system. In 2021, Jared played a key role in the passage of legacy conservative victories securing our Second Amendment rights with Constitutional Carry and protecting life with the Texas Heartbeat Act â€“ his proudest accomplishment in the legislature.

In February 2023, Speaker Dade Phelan appointed Representative Patterson to serve on the powerful House Calendars Committee and the Committees on Licensing & Administrative Procedure and Transportation. Jared is a member of the Texas House Republican Caucus where he serves as Chairman of the Policy Committee. He is a member of the Texas House Criminal Justice Reform Caucus, the Texas Cyber Security Council and is Secretary of the Texas Aggie Caucus. Rep. Patterson also serves as a board member for the Texas Conservative Coalition.

Jared and his family reside in Frisco and are members of the First Baptist Church of Frisco.
