Joanne Shofner is a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, representing District 11. She assumed office on January 14, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 12, 2027.

Joanne Shofner is a seventh-generation Texan with deep roots in her community. Before entering politics, she built a career as a small business owner and a Christian life coach, focusing on helping women recover from trauma. Her professional background also includes experience as a manager for Hyatt Hotels, and she holds a degree in hotel and restaurant management from the University of Houston.

Shofner's political journey began with her active involvement in the Nacogdoches County Republican Party, where she served as president. Her commitment to conservative values and her advocacy for school voucher programs set her apart as a candidate. In 2024, she challenged and defeated incumbent Travis Clardy in a contentious Republican primary. With endorsements from prominent figures like Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Donald Trump, and Senator Ted Cruz, Shofner secured a decisive victory in the primary and went on to win the general election unopposed.

As a legislator, Shofner is dedicated to advancing policies that align with her conservative principles. Her priorities include education reform, economic development, and supporting small businesses. She is known for her strong stance on school vouchers, which she believes are essential for providing families with greater educational choices.
