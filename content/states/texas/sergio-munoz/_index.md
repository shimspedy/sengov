Sergio Muñoz, Jr. was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives for District 36 in March 2010. The district includes parts or all of the cities of Hidalgo, Granjeno, McAllen, Mission, Palmview, Alton, Palmhurst and Pharr in Hidalgo County. Since his election, Sergio has received countless accolades, such as, recognition for his continual support and leadership from the Advocates for Patient Access, the Boys and Girls Club Texas Alliance, Alliance of Independent Pharmacists, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection RGV Sector. The awards highlight his commitment to our community and the diligent attention he gives to District 36.

Sergio has served as Vice-Chairman of the Insurance Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Land and Resource Management Committee. He also served as a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee from the 83rd Legislative Session through the 86th Legislative Session. Currently, Sergio is a member of the Ways & Means Committee and the committee on Defense & Veterans Affairs. He attended Mission High School and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Business Administration. Afterwards, Sergio earned his law degree with honors at the Thurgood Marshall School of Law and graduated magna cum laude.

He relentlessly aims to strengthen the region by supporting legislation and initiatives that improve education, healthcare, infrastructure, economic development, and public safety; including the restoration of critical funding to public schools and the Medicaid program. Sergio believes that collaboration and communication are the most effective means of achieving the necessary results that South Texas deserves and strives to build community bridges to promote partnership among South Texas leaders.
