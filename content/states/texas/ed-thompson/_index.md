State Representative Ed Thompson proudly serves the 29th District in the Texas House of Representatives, encompassing the northern and eastern part of Brazoria County. Currently serving his sixth term, Representative Thompson was first elected in 2012.
Representative Thompson is the Vice Chairman for the House Transportation Committee, and serves on the House Appropriations Committee and the House Resolutions Calendars Committee. In these roles, Ed has been a vocal advocate for the district on vital issues facing the state, such as securing funding for Texas roads, funding our public schools, improving border safety and security, increasing funding for water resources, and safeguarding Texans' Constitutional rights.
Although many know Ed as their local insurance agent, he has a long record of service to his community. Prior to serving in the legislature, he was Mayor Pro-Tem of Pearland, Chairman of the Pearland Chamber of Commerce, President of the Economic Development Corporation, and member of the Pearland ISD Board of Trustees. In each of these positions, he prepared for and addressed rapid community growth, fought for sensible policies to help local families and businesses thrive, and ensured the best quality education for all students.
Representative Thompson is a principled business and family man who knows that if we want to preserve our way of life, we need strong leaders who are not afraid to get in the game. He dedicated 40 years to being a high school football referee, so Ed knows a little something about the importance of reliable leaders.

A graduate of the University of Houston with a BBA in Finance, Ed is a devoted husband to his wife Freddie, dedicated father to his two children, and loving grandfather to his four grandchildren. The Thompson family attends Sagemont Church in Houston.
