Don McLaughlin is a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, representing District 80. He assumed office on January 14, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 12, 2027.

Born on September 20, 1961, in Austin, Texas, McLaughlin grew up in a family deeply rooted in Texas culture. His father, Don McLaughlin Sr., was a football star at the University of Texas, and his mother, Barbara Ann Neal, was a former Miss Travis County. The family moved to Uvalde, Texas, during McLaughlin's early years, where his father worked as a football coach and later in the pipe business. McLaughlin attended Texas State University and Angelo State University but returned to Uvalde before completing his degree to join his father in business.

In 2000, McLaughlin co-founded DKM Enterprises, a successful pipe business employing nearly 100 people. His entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to his community led him to public service. In 2014, he was encouraged by the Uvalde Chamber of Commerce to run for mayor, a position he held until 2023. During his tenure as mayor, McLaughlin focused on making Uvalde more business-friendly and addressing local concerns. He gained national attention for his leadership during the tragic Robb Elementary School shooting in 2022, where he advocated for his community and called for accountability.

McLaughlin's political career has been marked by his outspoken nature and dedication to his constituents. As a state representative, he continues to prioritize economic development, public safety, and community well-being. His journey from a small-town businessman to a state legislator reflects his deep commitment to serving the people of Texas.
