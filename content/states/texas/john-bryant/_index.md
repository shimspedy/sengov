Born on February 22, 1947, in Lake Jackson, Brazoria County, Texas, John Wiley Bryant is an American politician with a rich history of public service. He obtained his B.A. from Southern Methodist University in 1969 and pursued his legal education at Southern Methodist University School of Law, graduating in 1972. Admitted to the Texas bar that same year, Bryant began his legal career and served as counsel to a committee of the Texas Senate in 1973.

John Wiley Bryant entered the political arena by winning a special election to the Texas House of Representatives in 1974, subsequently earning reelection from 1974 to 1982. His commitment to public service led him to the U.S. Congress, where he represented Texas's 5th congressional district from the 98th to the 104th Congress.

During his tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives, Bryant played a significant role as one of the House impeachment managers prosecuting the case in the impeachment trial of Judge Alcee Hastings. Following his congressional service, Bryant sought the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1996 but later took on a diplomatic role as the head of the U.S. delegation to the 1997 World Radiocommunication Conference.

In 2021, after 24 years away from politics, Bryant returned to run for state representative in Texas's 114th district, winning both the primary in May 2022 and the general election in November 2022.

In 2023, Bryant actively opposed a bill in the Texas legislature aiming to permit accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in areas with single-family zoning. He voiced concerns about the potential adverse impact on neighborhoods, describing the proposal as a possible source of uncontrollable disruption.

Beyond his political pursuits, John Wiley Bryant co-founded the United Baseball League (UBL) in the mid-1990s. As of 2023, he is a student at Southern Methodist University's Perkins School of Theology, pursuing a degree in Spiritual Discipline and engaging in a prayer and spirituality course. This multifaceted journey reflects his ongoing commitment to learning, spirituality, and active participation in civic life.
