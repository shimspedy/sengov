Representative Ellen Troxclair is the proven conservative voice for Texas House District 19, the heart of Hill Country. Elected in a decisive victory in 2022, she served in the 88th Legislative session and subsequent special sessions on the Homeland Security & Public Safety Committee, Culture, Recreation, & Tourism Committee, House Select Committee on Community Safety, and Select Study Committee on Sustainable Property Tax Relief. She is devoted mom, non-profit leader, and small business owner who is grateful to represent Blanco, Burnet, Gillespie, Kendall and western Travis Counties.

Representative Troxclair was a key advocate in passing the largest property tax cut in United States history, providing unprecedented funding to secure our border, protecting womenâ€™s ability to compete fairly in sports, and ensuring that our children are shielded from those who wish them harm. She is a leading voice in ensuring every child has access to a great education, ending human trafficking across our border, expanding property tax relief, and keeping Texas a great place to work and raise a family. Her principled low tax, limited government, and pro-family values have helped to shape the national conversation and keep Texas a beacon of liberty.

Representative Troxclair is the bestselling author of Step Up! How to Advocate like a Woman, inspiring a new generation of conservative women to boldly join the fight, through advocacy and leadership in policy and politics. Representative Troxclair previously served as the youngest-ever elected woman, and lone conservative voice, on the Austin City Council. In addition to managing a thriving small business in residential real estate, her background also includes work as a Senior Fellow with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, as a Fox News contributor, and as a writer for Real Clear Politics, the Washington Examiner, and the Daily Caller.

Representative Troxclair and her husband, Caleb are leaders in their local church and loving parents of three young children, who are ninth generation Texans. The Troxclairs are committed to fostering in them an appreciation of natural beauty and resources of our state, as well as the spirit of grit & grace in the people who have made Texas such a unique and special place to call home.
