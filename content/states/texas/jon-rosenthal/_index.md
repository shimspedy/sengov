Representative Jon Rosenthal has been in Texas since 1979 after being born in the prestigious Stanford University Hospital in 1963. His father Haskell was the John T. Stuart III Centennial Professor of Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin for over 25 years and his mother Maryon is a retired Cosmetics Sales Director.

A graduate of The University of Texas at Austin in 1991, Jon earned his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. He has since worked for over 25 years as a Project Manager, Engineering Manager, and Subsea Systems Engineer in and around the oil & gas industry. In 2016, Jon earned a Graduate Certificate in Subsea Engineering from the University of Houston.

Representative Rosenthal has been a strong fighter, advocate and champion for better public schools, healthcare and ensuring we have comprehensive criminal justice reform across the State of Texas. Grateful and fortunate enough to be elected by the great constituents of House District 135 (Northwest Houston - Cypress and Jersey Village), Jon continues his fight in the state legislature to advocate for these issues amongst other needs. He will bring a unique background to the chamber as being only one of two practicing engineers in the Texas State House of Representatives and the only mechanical engineer serving in the body.

As a new member to the 86th Legislative session, Representative Rosenthal served on the County Affairs and Energy Resources Committees. He was honored to receive the Freshman of the Year award from the non-partisan Legislative Study Group, the second largest caucus in the Texas State House dedicated to developing mainstream solutions and advancing sound public policy benefitting all Texans.

Jon is happily married to his wife Aminta, and they share 2 adult children; Janet and Bryan. The Rosenthal family has lived in Northwest Houston since 2007.
