Representative Sheryl Cole got her start in public life stepping up in her local PTA and organizing community support for our schools as one of the Tri-Chairs to the AISD Bond Committee in 2004. Continuing down the path of public service, she would go on to be elected to Austin City Council for three terms, ultimately serving as Austin's first African American Mayor Pro Tempore. And now, as of 2018, Sheryl Cole represents the communities of East Austin, Manor, and Pflugerville at the Texas Legislature.

In her freshman term, Sheryl was appointed to serve on the Ways and Means, County Affairs, and Redistricting committees. By the end of the Legislative Session, she was recognized as a Texas Legislative Black Caucus Freshman of the Year for her ability to strike compromise with amendments and pass legislation out of the House.

Beyond any of these achievements and accomplishments, what she is most proud of raising her three sons - Marcus, Nelson, and Femi - into the successful young men they have become. She is an active member of David Chapel Missionary Baptist Church.
