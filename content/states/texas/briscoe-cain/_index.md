A lifelong resident of Harris County, Briscoe’s Texas roots run deeper than most. Named Briscoe in honor of a family surname Briscoe, his lineal ancestor, Andrew Briscoe fought in the Texian Army and was a signor of the Texas Declaration of Independence.

Briscoe grew up in a working class home in Deer Park. The son of a plant operator and occupational nurse, he was taught the value of hard work and a strong commitment to his community. Briscoe worked his way through college and law school where he earned a Bachelor's Degree from the University of Houston-Downtown and a Doctorate of Jurisprudence from South Texas College of Law. Currently, Briscoe owns and operates the Law Office of Briscoe Cain, PLLC.

Briscoe has a record of defending the unborn and religious liberty. In 2016, Briscoe’s advocacy made headline news when he released invoices exposing four Texas Medical Schools for using tax dollars to purchase aborted fetal tissue. In December of 2015, Briscoe successfully defended the religious rights of Beaumont Police Officers when the City of Beaumont banned them from having a Bible study on their lunch break.

As the State Representative of House District 128, Briscoe has brought those same values to Austin. He has consistently received high legislative ratings from organizations like the National Federation of Independent Business, National Rifle Association, Texas Right to Life, Young Conservatives of Texas, and other conservative groups.

In the Texas House of Representatives, Briscoe currently serves as Chair of the House Committee on Elections and as a member of the House Committee on Business & Industry. Previously, Briscoe served as Chair of the Select Committee on Driver's License Issuance and Renewal. He has previously served on the Committees on International Relations & Economic Development, Defense & Veteran Affairs, and Juvenile Justice & Family Issues.

Briscoe also serves as a member of the Windstorm Insurance Legislative Funding and Funding Structure Oversight Board. The Funding Structure Oversight Board is made up of four members each from the Texas Senate and the Texas House of Representatives, and is tasked with gathering information on the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association's funding, determining how states operate catastrophic risk pools, and holding public meetings to hear testimony on funding for the organization. Briscoe also serves the State of Texas as a Captain in the Texas State Guard.

A loving husband and proud father of five, Briscoe and his wife Bergundi are residents of Deer Park. The Cain family attends Faith Family Church in Baytown.
