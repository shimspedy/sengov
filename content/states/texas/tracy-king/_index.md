Tracy O. King graduated from Carrizo Springs High School, attended Southwest Texas Junior College and Texas A&M University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering. In 1983 Representative King took a job with the Beltone Hearing Aid Center in San Antonio and soon after moved to Uvalde to open a branch office there. He later purchased the Beltone Hearing Aid Center and owned and operated it until 2008 when he sold the business to spend more time with his family.

Representative King has always been active in public service, a former member of the Board of Trustees for the First United Methodist Church and a past president of both the Kiwanis Club and the Texas Hearing Aid Association. He is currently the Chairman of the powerful House Natural Resources Committee and serves as a member of the Energy Resources Committee. He previously served as chairman of Border and International Affairs; Agriculture and Livestock; and Licensing and Administrative Procedures Committee.

During his tenure in the Texas House of Representatives he has served on committees such as Natural Resources, Appropriations, Ways & Means, Calendars, Environmental Regulation, Agriculture and Livestock, Border and International Affairs, Culture, Recreation and Tourism and Licensing and Administrative Procedures. He also serves on the Edwards Aquifer Oversight Committee and the Energy Council.

Representative King is married to the former Cheryl Baker of Hondo and they are the proud parents of two children, Katelyn Marie King and Clayton Baker King.
