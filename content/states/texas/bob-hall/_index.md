Currently in the 88th Legislature, Texas Senator Bob Hall, is the Chairman of the vital Senate Committee on Administration and an influential voting member on the Senate Committee of Finance, Health and Human Services, Local Government, and Veteran Affairs. He has earned the reputation of being open minded and willing to discuss ideas but absolutely unwavering in holding to his core conservative principles and Judeo-Christian values. He is a man who believes in the Declaration of Independence and follows the Constitution. He is pro-life, pro-gun, pro-liberty, pro-property rights, pro Judeo-Christian conservative values, a staunch proponent of the free market, fiscally responsible, and pro-limited government. Senator Hall was instrumental in making Texas a 2nd Amendment Sanctuary State, as well as, protecting religious organizations and churches from Government shutdown.

After the Air Force he worked in the Aerospace industry as a systems engineer and business development manager. In 1982 he left the corporate world and began working as an independent proposal consultant to aerospace and defense corporations. Then in 1984 he formed his own company, Professional Proposal Management, Inc.

A compelling sense of duty, shaped by his military service, business experience, and love for this country, drives him to leave behind the legacy of a patriotic servant for his children and grandchildren. Envisioning their futures compelled him to become actively involved in the state's political process and strongly believes it is time to stand in the gap for our children, our liberties and our future.
