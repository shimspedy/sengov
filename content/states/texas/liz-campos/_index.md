Representative Elizabeth “Liz” Campos of House District 119 is serving her second term in the Texas House of Representatives. She represents the cities of San Antonio, Converse, Live Oak, Schertz, St. Hedwig, and Universal City.

In her first term, Representative Campos was selected as “Freshman of the Year” by the Texas House Legislative Study Group. She authored important legislation to improve the quality of life for seniors at nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and independent living. Her legislation would require state certification of all institutions that care for persons with Alzheimer’s disease; protect personal funds of residents living in long-term care facilities; and leverage federal funding for independent living programs.

Campos also filed legislation to address homelessness and affordable housing in Bexar County. This legislation consisted of housing first initiatives; transitional housing pilot programs; housing mobility investments; and the creation of an affordable housing trust fund to provide incentives for the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing.

In addition to advancing her legislation, she also worked to expand Medicaid, fully fund public schools, and finance local infrastructure projects that generate jobs, create opportunity, and reduce poverty in our community.

Representative Campos is the first women elected to represent HD 119. She has thirty years experience as a legal administrator at major law firms in San Antonio and previously served in the Texas Legislature as a House Constituent Coordinator, Senate District Director, and Senate Chief of Staff.

As well as serving her community in the Texas House of Representatives, Liz Campos is a successful businesswoman, third generation plumber, and lives in Southeast San Antonio with her three German Shepherds Jojo, Mona, and Lobo.

For the 88th Legislative Session, Texas Speaker of the House Dade Phelan has selected Representative Campos to serve as Vice-Chair of the Public Health Committee. She was also appointed to the Human Services Committee and the House Redistricting Committee.
