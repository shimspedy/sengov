State Senator Nathan Johnson represents almost a million people in Texas’s Senate District 16, a commercially and culturally vibrant district that sprawls throughout Dallas County. He is a leading voice on the electrical grid, healthcare, governmental transparency, and criminal justice.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Business & Commerce, Johnson played a crucial role in the 88th session’s legislation to address the sufficiency, sustainability, and resiliency of Texas’ power generation and distribution systems. He also serves on the Senate Committees on Jurisprudence (Vice Chair); Water, Agriculture & Rural Affairs; and Administration.

In the most recent Legislative session, Johnson authored more than 150 bills, joint-authored or sponsored nearly 100 more, and sent 49 of them to the Governor’s desk for signature. Aiming to ensure that Texans never again lose critical services due to power failure, Johnson devised and secured nearly $2B for the development and deployment of backup power systems for essential community services throughout the state. Other bills passed include a collection of healthcare advances (including infant hearing, student mental health, adults with Alzheimer’s, and expanding access to Medicaid), law enforcement systems and benefits, data privacy and high-tech security measures, and modernization of finance, insurance, and construction laws and regulations. He served as a principal ally to state agencies in efforts to improve efficiency and responsiveness and passed several measures supporting law enforcement and criminal justice systems.

Senator Johnson embraces the responsibility to build and maintain an environment that fosters sustainable economic growth and improves life for all Texans.

Johnson holds degrees in physics from the University of Arizona and a law degree from the University of Texas at Austin. He is a commercial litigator in the Dallas office of Thompson Coburn and has composed music for the classical concert stage, and musical scores for the hit anime series Dragon Ball Z. He and his wife Anne live in Dallas, where they raised their three kids, Sophie, Theo, and Finn.
