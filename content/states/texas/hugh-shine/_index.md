State Representative Hugh D. Shine was the first Republican in Bell County to be elected since 1876 to the Texas House of Representatives in 1986.

He returned to the Legislature in 2016 and elected to his fourth term in 2022.

Shine’s political career included a presidential appointment in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, serving on the President’s Intergovernmental Council on Education from 1986-1990. He also served on the Temple City Council and was Mayor Pro-Tem.

He has worked extensively to bring greater transparency, accountability, and fairness to the Texas Property Tax Code. His efforts in the legislature focus on business and commerce initiatives.
