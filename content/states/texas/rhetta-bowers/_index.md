Representative Bowers was elected to serve House District 113 in the Texas House of Representatives on November 8, 2018. She made history as the first African American elected to represent this district. Being of African American and Caribbean descent, she became the first Afro-Latina elected to the Texas House. House District 113 includes parts of Rowlett, Garland and Mesquite.

Bowers was drawn to activism at an early age, following the example of her mother, a prominent community leader, and her father, a nationally recognized surgeon. She is an alumna of Spelman College and Texas Southern University, earning her bachelor’s degree in Telecommunications, with an emphasis in Broadcast Journalism.

Upon graduation, she began her career as a broadcast journalist in public television working at PBS headquarters and for WETA-TV 26/Radio 90.9 in the District of Columbia. She moved to commercial television once she returned home to Texas working at KCEN-TV 6 in production, and was later promoted to news producer. Bowers has held many positions within the television industry, but it was her job as the educational services coordinator for KERA TV 13/Radio 90.1 that resonated most with her and fueled her dedication to supporting and improving education.

Throughout her adult life, Representative Bowers has always invested time and energy in her community. Bowers is an advocate for children and education. She is a former educator, and has volunteered many hours on Garland Independent School District PTA and Band Booster executive boards. She maintains an active membership at St. Luke "Community" United Methodist Church and is a lifetime member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated. She served on the Rowlett Parks and Recreation Advisory Board for 8 years. Bowers was also a member of the Rowlett Community Investment Task Force, an ad hoc committee for several years, and helped with the recovery of the city, after the devastating tornado that caused major devastation in December of 2015. In addition, Representative Bowers co-founded the Dallas Women's March, and co-chaired the event from its inception and has been a founding member of the organization since 2016.

During the 86th Legislative Session, Bowers served on the House Committees for Corrections, Juvenile Justice & Family Issues, and Local and Consent Calendars. Representative Bowers champions women and children's rights, juvenile justice issues, working towards eliminating the school to prison pipeline, and uplifting marginalized communities in every level of government. She has been recognized across the state for authoring House Bill 3435, which declares March 1st as "Texas Girls in STEM Day," a day designated to highlight women in STEM and encourage and expose young girls, with support from local school districts and organizations, to embrace and enter fields relating to science, engineering, technology, math and the arts.

During the 87th Legislative Session, Bowers continued her commitment of supporting human rights by filing the Texas CROWN Act which protects against discrimination based on race-based hairstyles by extending statutory protections to hair texture and styles such as braids, locs, twists, and knots in the workplace and public schools. Bowers also filed multiple bills to provide additional resources to people experiencing homelessness and to aid those whose life's work is helping them.

In the 88th Legislative Session, Bowers followed through on that commitment, passing the Texas CROWN Act, House Bill 567, along with House Bill 568, which provides trainings for peace officers for interactions with people with Alzheimer’s or other dementias. She proudly serves on the House Committees for Criminal Jurisprudence, Homeland Security & Public Safety, the Speaker’s Select Committee on Community Safety, and as Vice Chair of Local and Consent Calendars.

Representative Bowers has been honored for her public service by several organizations as the recipient of the following awards: the 2019 Bands of Hope "Trailblazer Award", the Afiya Center's "Legislative Achievement Award", Texas Southern University's "Distinguished Alumna of the Year", Greater North Dallas Business and Professional Women’s Club “Woman of the Year,” and named the Texas Legislative Black Caucus 2019 "Freshman of the Year.” In 2021, she received the “Humanitarian Award” from the Alpha Sigma Lambda chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. In 2022, Bowers was a recipient of the Roy Wilkins Civil Rights - 2022 NAACP Image Award for breaking quorum to fight for the freedom to vote with her colleagues in the House Democratic Caucus, Texas Legislative Black Caucus, and Mexican American Legislative Caucus. She also received the Changemaker Award for Political Leadership from Dallas’ New Leadership Council in 2022. In 2023, the first year that Juneteenth was celebrated as a National Holiday, she was a Juneteenth Honoree of the Rowlett Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee. She is also a proud 2023 recipient of the President Joseph R. Biden Lifetime Achievement Award.

Though she is a proud native Houstonian, Representative Bowers has resided in Rowlett with her husband MSG (ret.) John P. Bowers, Jr. and their 2 children for more 20 years and proudly calls House District 113 home.
