Senator Drew Springer is a lifelong conservative Christian, fights to preserve traditional Texas values, promote economic development, and undue burdensome regulations. Drew is a champion for the taxpayers, fights for Pro-Life legislation, and defends the Second Amendment. He was elected to the Texas House in 2013 and was consistently ranked among the top conservatives. In his first session in the Senate, he was ranked as the 2nd most conservative Senate member and one of the top 3 effective freshman in the last 20 years.

Drew grew up in Weatherford where he attended Weatherford High School. He went on to attend Weatherford College, and then the University of North Texas where he was a letterman and received his accounting degree.

He spent fifteen years working for a Texas railcar company where he started as an accountant and rose to be president of three divisions. He left to join his fatherâ€™s financial services company where he has specialized in agricultural futures and securities for the last sixteen years.

Drew and his wife of 30 years, Lydia, reside in Muenster, where they are blessed to have raised their three children and welcomed their first grandson in 2020. The family is active members of Sacred Heart Catholic Church where Drew serves on the finance council. Additionally, Drew has been a volunteer fireman for fifteen years.
