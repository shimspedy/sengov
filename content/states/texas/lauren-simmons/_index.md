Lauren Ashley Simmons is a Democratic Party member serving in the Texas House of Representatives. She represents District 146,  Simmons assumed office on January 14, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 12, 2027.

Lauren Simmons has dedicated her career to advocating for the rights and well-being of her community. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she has firsthand experience with the challenges faced by many of her constituents. Her journey into public service was shaped by her early life experiences, which taught her resilience and the importance of community support. As a young mother, she navigated the difficulties of raising a child while pursuing her education and career, an experience that deeply informs her commitment to policies that support working families.

Before entering politics, Simmons worked extensively in the labor movement. She began her career with the Texas State Employees Union and later joined the American Federation of Teachers, where she spent nearly five years advocating for educators and public school employees. Her work as a union organizer and her role as a shop steward for CWA 1180 highlight her dedication to workers' rights and fair labor practices.

In the Texas House of Representatives, Simmons has been a vocal advocate for strengthening public schools, ensuring access to affordable healthcare, and addressing economic disparities. She is particularly passionate about supporting teachers, students, and parents, as well as fighting for healthcare solutions that prevent individuals from having to choose between essential medications and basic living expenses.

Simmons is an active member of several caucuses and organizations, including the Texas House Democratic Caucus, the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, the Texas House LGBTQ Caucus, and the Texas Legislative Progressive Caucus. She also serves as the inaugural chair of the Labor & Workforce Caucus, reflecting her deep commitment to labor issues.

Her personal story of overcoming adversity and her dedication to public service have made her a respected figure in her district and beyond. Simmons continues to work tirelessly to create a more equitable and inclusive Texas, drawing inspiration from the community that shaped her and the values she holds dear.
