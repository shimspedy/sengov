A 5th generation Central Texan, Stan Gerdes resides in Smithville, Texas. After high school, Stan made his way to Austin to attend college at The University of Texas, where he met his wife, Samantha, on the first day of class.

Prior to Stan’s election to the Texas House, he worked with Governor Rick Perry for over a decade – beginning when he was Governor of Texas, and throughout his time as Secretary of Energy, where they were able to achieve U.S. Energy Independence for the first time in nearly 60 years. As Senior Advisor to Secretary Perry, Stan led an extensive team to organize and manage every aspect of the Secretary’s agenda – including travel to all 17 national labs, and to over 25 countries promoting American energy solutions abroad so our allies would be less reliant on hostile nations.

During Representative Gerdes’ first legislative session, he worked to pass the largest property tax cut in American history, secured $5.1 billion for border security initiatives, carried and passed legislation that significantly increased funding for rural law enforcement agencies, and assisted in creating the Texas Water Fund to ensure access to our most precious resource for generations to come. Representative Gerdes’ priorities also include protecting the right to life, defending individual liberties, and upholding the Second Amendment.

Stan is a proud Camp Longhorn alumnus and a lifetime member of the Texas Exes, the Dallas Safari Club and the National Rifle Association. Stan’s wife, Samantha, is an attorney and serves as general counsel for Texas firearm manufacturer, LaRue Tactical. She is also an active member of the Junior League where she has dedicated many years to volunteering in organizations such as FIT (Food in Tummies), Coats for Kids, Women’s Storybook Project, and Drive-A-Senior.

Stan and Samantha are both proud graduates of The University of Texas at Austin, and reside in Smithville, Texas with their baby boy.
