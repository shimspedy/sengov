Kronda Thimesch (pronounced "KRAWN-da TIMM-esh") is a 30-year Denton County resident who was elected in November 2022 to represent the people of House District 65 in the Texas House. HD 65 stretches across southern Denton County from its western to eastern border, and includes 20 communities and five school districts. Cities in the district include Dallas, Carrollton, Lewisville, Hebron, Plano, The Colony, Highland Village, Double Oak, Bartonville, Copper Canyon, Lantana, Argyle, Denton, Justin, Draper, Northlake and Fort Worth.

Kronda attended Texas Tech University, where she majored in landscape architecture. While at Texas Tech, she met her husband, Jeff Thimesch, and after graduation, they got married and moved to Denton County. Soon after arriving in north Texas, they started a small family business out of their garage. Today, their company is a regional employer and community partner that serves residents across the DFW area.

In 2015, Kronda was elected to serve as a school board trustee for one of the largest school districts in Texas, Lewisville ISD. During her successful five-year tenure as trustee, Kronda worked to ensure every single student's best interest was at the forefront. During her time as trustee, Kronda earned the "Master Trustee" designation which is given by the Texas Association of School Boards.

Kronda is an active member in her community, serving as an officer, director or board member in many civic and charitable organizations, including the Lewisville Education Foundation, Castle Hills Foundation, Flower Mound Rotary, several local chambers of commerce, the Children’s Advocacy Center, Carrollton Women’s Club, American Legion Auxiliary, and Highland Village Women’s Club, among others. Kronda and Jeff have been married for almost 33 years, have four grown children, and one grandchild. They have been active members of Bent Tree Bible Fellowship for over 25 years and have served as Sunday School teachers, Life Group Leaders and Youth Leaders.

Kronda is passionate about serving the needs and representing the values of HD 65 in Austin, and is humbled to have the opportunity to do so as a member of the Texas House of Representatives in such a time as this.
