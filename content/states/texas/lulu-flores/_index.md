Lulu Flores is a longtime champion of equality and social justice. She rose through the grassroots ranks to serve as President and CEO of the National Women’s Political Caucus, the longest serving institution committed to increasing women’s participation throughout the political process. Likewise, Lulu’s leadership can be seen at all levels, from being elected a National Delegate for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, to Chairing the Austin Arts Commission, to serving as Chief of Staff to the first Mexican American woman elected to the Texas House, Representative Irma Rangel.

Growing up along the border as the youngest of nine children, Lulu’s commitment to civil rights was instilled by her father, an attorney and one of the founding members of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). But she also saw how little would be accomplished were it not for the behind the scenes work of strong women like her mother.

Thanks to her parents’ strong belief in education, Lulu moved to Austin to study at the University of Texas, where she also graduated from law school. She began her career in the state legislature working for Rep. Irma Rangel, a pioneer who rose to serve as Chair of the Higher Education Committee. Lulu continued her career in public service working as Director of Legislative Programs for the State Bar of Texas, and Assistant Director for Alternative Fuels Policy and Legislation/Governmental Affairs at the Texas Railroad Commission, before joining her husband, Scott, as partner in their law firm, Hendler Flores Law, PLLC.

Lulu is excited and looks forward to serving on Culture, Recreation, & Tourism and Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence during her first session in the Texas House.
