Mike Schofield is in his fourth term serving in the Texas House of Representatives, where he represents Katy and part of Cy-Fair in Harris County.

Previously, he served for 11 years as an advisor to Governor Rick Perry, where he advised the governor on issues ranging from property rights protection and eminent domain to election integrity to protecting Texans from frivolous lawsuits.

In the 2017 session, Mike drafted and filed the constitutional amendment to ban a state income tax in Texas, which finally passed in 2019.

Mike was named the “Freshman Legislator of the Year” by his House colleagues for his work during the 2015 legislative session, and was recognized as one of five outstanding freshmen in the House and Senate by the Texas legislative newsletter Capitol Inside. He was also named a “Courageous Conservative” by the Texas Conservative Coalition.

During his first term, Mike passed a major piece of legislation backed by Governor Abbott to provide for a three-judge panel to hear all lawsuits involving school finance or redistricting. This will ensure that one judge in Austin will no longer be able to single-handedly re-write the school finance system that effects our property taxes and our children’s education.
