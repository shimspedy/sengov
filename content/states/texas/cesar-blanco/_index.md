Senator César J. Blanco proudly represents the people of Brewster, Culberson, El Paso, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Pecos, Presidio, and Reeves counties in the Texas Senate.

César was raised in El Paso and after high school, he continued his family’s tradition of military service in the U.S. Navy. He graduated from the University of Texas at El Paso and continued his public service by working for three Members of Congress representing El Paso and West Texas.

César was first elected in 2014 to the Texas House of Representatives. During his three terms, he delivered for El Paso by leading initiatives to strengthen our workforce, economy, and border communities, improving the quality of life and increasing economic opportunities. He led efforts to protect education benefits and expand mental health resources for veterans, rein in rising prescription drug prices, and increase oversight over border security. For his record, Texas Monthly named him one of the best legislators in Texas.

In 2020, César was elected to the Texas Senate. In his first term in the Senate, Senator Blanco served on the Senate Committees on Health & Human Services, Higher Education, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs & Border Security. As a freshman, Senator Blanco championed legislation to help our community recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, expand access to healthcare, bridge the digital divide, curb gun violence after the El Paso mass shooting, and protect military service members from sexual assault in honor of US Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen.

Senator Blanco currently serves on the distinguished Senate Committees on Health & Human Services; Natural Resources & Economic Development; Water, Agriculture, & Rural Affairs; Veteran Affairs; and Border Security. In addition, he serves as the Vice-Chairman of the Texas Senate Hispanic Caucus.

Senator Blanco is active in the community as a member of the American Legion, El Paso Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), the Rio Grande Council of Governments (RCOG), the Medical Center of Americas (MCA), National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) Educational Fund Board of Directors, and Project Bravo Board of Directors. César lives in El Paso with his wife Lili, and their dogs Lulu and Skipper (Skip).
