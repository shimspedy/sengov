Representative Cody Vasut is a conservative problem-solver representing House District 25, comprised of southern and western Brazoria County. He currently serves as Vice Chair of the Business & Industry Committee and member of the Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence Committees in the 88th Session.

Cody is an 8th generation Texan and 5th generation resident of Angleton, where he grew up around the dinner table at his grandfather’s house learning about local issues and the ways his parents and extended family were serving their community to address them. Cody took their example to heart and has devoted himself to serving his community to ensure it remains a great place to live, work, and raise a family.

Cody graduated summa cum laude from Texas A&M University with a B.B.A. and M.S. in Management. He was honored to serve as the 37th Speaker of the Student Senate his senior year. Cody went on to graduate summa cum laude and valedictorian from the University of Houston Law Center with a Juris Doctorate.

For more than a decade, he has worked as an attorney, representing a variety of businesses in oil and gas, personal injury defense, employment, and theft of trade secret litigation across the United States. Cody previously served as President of the Brazoria County Bar Association and is a Texas Bar Foundation Fellow.

In 2011, Cody founded a college ministry, Revive, which has ministered to hundreds of young adults at Brazosport College and across the area. In 2016, he was elected to serve on Angleton City Council. On council and in the legislature, he is known for his transparency, deep inquiry into issues, and common-sense approach to solving problems.
Cody also serves on the Board of Directors for the Pregnancy Help Center of Brazosport, where he puts his pro-life values into practice supporting the ministry’s work to assist new families and single mothers across southern Brazoria County and beyond. Cody is passionate about changing hearts, minds, and laws to end abortion and protect innocent children.

Cody and his wife, Kate, have two daughters, Sparrow and Lily, and one son, William. They attend Second Baptist Church in Angleton, where Cody serves as a lay preacher and drummer in the praise band.
