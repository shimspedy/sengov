Mary Ann Perez is a former Houston Community College Board of Trustees Chair and current State Representative for Texas House District 144. After graduating from Milby High School, Mary Ann worked her way through college, earning a degree in Business Administration from University of Houston-Downtown. She went on to build a successful insurance agency located in Southeast Harris County. While busy with her career, she was never too busy for her two sons or her neighborhood. She was an active Little League and school volunteer, and served as President of the Meadow Creek Civic Association. 

Mary Ann would then be elected to the Houston Community College Board of Trustees in 2009. As a trustee, Mary Ann worked hard to move HCC and our community forward by partnering with area employers to ensure the programs reflect the needs of today’s workforce and community. She worked with area schools and community groups to develop programs to keep children in school and continuing their education. During her first term, she was chosen as Freshman of the Year by the bipartisan Legislative Study Group, and continues to work across the aisle to move Texas forward. 

Representative Mary Ann Perez is serving her fifth term in the Texas House of Representatives and serves on the Texas House Committees on Insurance and on Transportation. House District 144 includes all of South Houston and portions of the Houston, Pasadena, and Deer Park.
