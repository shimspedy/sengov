State Representative Armando Walle is serving his eighth term in the Texas House of Representatives. First elected in 2008, Representative Walle represents Texas House District 140 which consists of portions of north Houston and unincorporated portions of north Harris county-- including parts of the Northside and Aldine communities, where he grew up, graduated from MacArthur High School, and still resides.

During his time in the Texas Legislature, Representative Walle has worked on many issues important to him and his constituents, with a particular focus on improving the health, safety, and economic well-being of working families. Representative Walle, raised by a single mother and the oldest of 5 children, was the first in his family to attend and graduate from college. The experiences and lessons of his humble upbringing have informed his legislative priorities. Representative Walle has authored a variety of bills toward those priorities, including providing water utility customers recourse for nonexistent water service, helping nursing mothers return to work, establishing Texas’ Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force, and the Institute for a Disaster Resilient Texas. His efforts as an elected official have been instrumental in bringing new clinics to medically underserved areas in House District 140, and building the East Aldine Town Center-- which includes the BakerRipley campus, the Harris County 911 Call Center, and a Lone Star College-North Harris campus.
Most recently, he brought home wins for HD 140 by securing funding for an $18 million flood control project, supporting the construction of a new food bank/community center and joint-authoring legislation to establish a $3 billion endowment for certain Texas universities — including the University of Houston. In previous Sessions, Armando established the Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force, the Institute for a Disaster Resilient Texas, and was instrumental in the construction of the East Aldine Town Center.

Representative Walle is currently a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, serving as Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Articles VI, VII, VII (natural resources, business & industry, and regulatory entities). Representative Walle, in his work on the House Appropriations committee, has sought to broaden access to healthcare by providing more resources to and protecting the state's women’s health programs while fighting perennial efforts to erode safety net programs crucial to so many children and families across the state. In his service on the Article VI, VII, VIII subcommittee, he has worked to bolster our state's water supply while also increasing our flood readiness statewide. He also serves as a member of the House Committee on Licensing and Administrative Procedures, the Select Committee on Sustainable Property Tax Relief, the Select Committee on Health Care Reform and the House Committee on House Administration.

Representative Walle has previously also served on the House Committees on Energy Resources, Human Services, Business & Industry, Insurance, Higher Education, Redistricting, as well as the Appropriations Subcommittees on Article II (health and human services agencies) and Article III (public and higher education), and others.

Representative Walle is a member of a number of legislative caucuses, including the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus, for which he serves on the board as General Counsel. He is also the chairman of the Legislative Study Group – an official caucus that analyzes every bill that comes to the House Floor. He is also a member of the House Democratic Caucus, Women’s Health Caucus, and LGBTQ Caucus.

Before Representative Walle was elected to the Texas House, he served on the staff of multiple elected officials, including Congressman Gene Green and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, where he led different community projects including Immunization Day, Paying for College workshops and senior citizen issue forums. Now a practicing attorney, Representative Walle earned his bachelor's and law degree from the University of Houston.

In his free time, State Representative Walle enjoys spending time with his family-- his wife, Debbie Walle, a Texas Women's University graduate, and their two young sons-- frequently celebrating and lamenting the ups and downs of his beloved University of Houston Cougars, Houston Astros, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets.
