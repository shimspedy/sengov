Born on February 18, 1977, in Kansas City, Missouri, Andy Hopper has built a diverse career that spans technology, education, and public service. He earned a bachelor's degree from Ohio University in 1997 and later pursued a graduate degree from the University of North Texas in 2000. His professional journey includes working as a software engineer, owning a software consulting firm, and serving as an adjunct professor at the University of North Texas. Hopper has also been actively involved in the Texas State Guard since 2014, where he holds the rank of Chief Warrant Officer.

Hopper's political career began with his victory in the 2024 general election, where he defeated incumbent Lynn Stucky in the Republican primary runoff. As a freshman legislator in the 89th Legislative Session, he was appointed to the Agriculture & Livestock Committee and the Insurance Committee. Early in his tenure, Hopper introduced House Bill 1982, which aimed to regulate federal arrest warrants for Texas citizens, and House Bill 2657, which proposed the abolishment of the Texas Education Agency.

Beyond his professional and legislative work, Hopper is deeply rooted in his community. He resides in Wise County, Texas, with his wife, Amanda, and their three sons. He is also a co-founder of the Trinity Conservative Coalition and Wise County Conservatives, reflecting his commitment to grassroots activism and conservative values.
