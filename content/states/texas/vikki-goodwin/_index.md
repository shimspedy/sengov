Vikki Goodwin is serving her third term representing Texas House District 47 in western Travis County, which includes the outskirts of Austin, Bee Cave and parts of Lake Travis. In the 88th Session, she was successful in passing a number of bills that serve her district and the state. To address safety issues, she passed Cati’s Act which is a drowning prevention law, and the Natalia Cox Act which is a violence prevention law. To address mental health needs, she passed a law that expands AcuDetox. And to ensure food security, she passed a law creating the Texas Food Security and Resiliency Council. Goodwin was a co-author of numerous other bills, and a sponsor of a Cottage Food Act which ran out of time and didn’t get passed.

Rep. Goodwin filed a set of bills to address public school funding, gun safety, environmental protection and more. She was a co-author on a bill to increase state employee salaries and to provide a cost-of-living increase to retired teachers.

In the next session, Rep. Goodwin will file the Affordable Rent Act, and will continue to advocate for the people of her district, the environment, a strong economy, and a sound budget.

Representative Goodwin is a small business owner, a real estate broker, and a community leader. After graduating from the University of Texas with a BBA—and the LBJ School of Public Affairs with a master’s degree—Vikki remains in Austin where she raised her children who are now grown.

A long-time resident of Shady Hollow, Vikki has been very active in her community, serving on various boards and commissions. Her volunteer work gave her insight into the need for various services in the community and strengthened her determination to help those who slip through the cracks, so often as a result of medical issues, student loans, or low paying jobs. Through her professional and philanthropic endeavors, Vikki knows which issues matter most to the residents of District 47 and was inspired to become an advocate for her community.
