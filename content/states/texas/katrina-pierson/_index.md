Katrina Pierson has been a prominent figure in conservative politics for over a decade. Her journey into public service began with her grassroots activism during the Tea Party movement, where she earned recognition as one of its "Founding Mothers." Her ability to articulate conservative principles in a relatable and compelling manner led to frequent appearances on national and international news networks, including Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC.

Born to a single mother who gave birth to her at the age of 15, Katrina grew up in poverty, facing numerous challenges. Determined to create a better life for herself and her son, she worked tirelessly while pursuing her education. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from the University of Texas at Dallas and built a successful career in the healthcare industry.

Her commitment to public service is evident in her previous roles, including appointments to the Texas Lieutenant Governorâ€™s Advisory Board and various healthcare and transportation boards. Katrina's efforts to increase civic engagement were officially recognized during the 83rd Texas Legislature.

In addition to her political career, Katrina is an entrepreneur who founded her own public affairs and crisis consulting firm. She has also served as a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and contributed to a pro-life nonprofit organization. Her dedication to conservative values and her ability to inspire others have made her a respected leader in Texas politics.

Katrina Pierson resides in Rockwall, Texas, and continues to advocate for policies that align with her principles and the interests of her constituents in District 33.
