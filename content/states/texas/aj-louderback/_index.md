AJ Louderback is a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, representing District 30. He assumed office on January 14, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 12, 2027.

Born and raised in Matagorda County, Texas, AJ Louderback is a fifth-generation Texan with deep roots in his community. A graduate of Palacios High School, he went on to serve in the United States Air Force, where he achieved the rank of sergeant and specialized as a Law Enforcement Specialist. After completing four years of active duty and six years in the reserves, Louderback transitioned to a career in law enforcement, dedicating over 40 years to serving and protecting his community.

Louderback is perhaps best known for his tenure as a five-term Sheriff of Jackson County, where he gained a reputation as a staunch advocate for public safety and border security. His leadership extended beyond his county, as he played a significant role in shaping state and national policies. He served as Vice Chair and Chair of the Legislative Division of the Sheriff’s Association of Texas and was instrumental in expanding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program across 16 Texas counties.

A lifelong conservative, Louderback is a vocal proponent of Second Amendment rights, lower property taxes, and strong public schools. He is also a founding member and the current Executive Director of the Texas Sheriff’s Regional Alliance. His commitment to his principles has earned him recognition on national platforms, including appearances on Fox News and Newsmax, where he has been a consistent voice for Texans.

In addition to his legislative and law enforcement achievements, Louderback is a family man and a follower of Jesus Christ. He continues to be an influential figure in Texas politics, advocating for policies that reflect his dedication to his constituents and his state.
