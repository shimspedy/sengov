State Representative Jeff Leach proudly serves the citizens of House District 67 in the heart of Collin County. Now serving in his sixth term, Representative Leach has consistently proven himself to be a committed conservative and effective leader in the Texas Capitol and has worked tirelessly to ensure that Texas remains strong for future generations.

Over the years, Jeff has worked diligently to tackle our state’s skyrocketing property taxes while making historic investments in and reforms to public education. In 2019, he authored and passed the landmark legislation giving way to “Proposition 4” - the constitutional amendment banning the imposition of a state income tax on individuals. Jeff has also worked tirelessly to advance legislation to secure our porous border, protect children from harmful and irreversible gender modification procedures, been a champion for innocent life, reined in rogue district attorneys, supported our active and retired teachers, reformed Texas' energy grid, strengthened our water infrastructure, secured the integrity of our elections and safeguarded your fundamental rights and freedoms.

During the 88th Legislative Session, Representative Leach was appointed by Speaker Dade Phelan to serve a third term as Chairman of the House Committee on Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence. Additionally, Representative Leach was selected to serve on the House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence. As Chairman of the House’s major legislative committee with oversight of the Texas justice system, Representative Leach worked to improve our state’s judiciary and advance sound reforms to civil practice and procedure. Specifically, he successfully authored legislation giving Texas judges a much-needed pay raise without raising legislator pensions, bolstered our state’s judiciary with the creation of 17 new courts across the state – including two in Collin County – and implemented various reforms to improve access to courts, higher pay for jurors and consolidated court fees to promote fairness and transparency.

Born and raised in Plano, Representative Leach graduated from Plano Senior High before attending Baylor University. He earned his law degree from Southern Methodist University’s Dedman School of Law, and currently practices at the law firm of Gray Reed & McGraw LLP in Dallas. Named a “Rising Star” by Texas Super Lawyer, Jeff specializes in complex commercial and civil litigation, construction law and real estate. Most recently, Representative Leach was named as a "Friend of the Judiciary" by the State Bar of Texas and was recognized as a "2019 Legislator of the Year" by the Texas Civil Justice League. Jeff serves on the Board of Trustees for Houston Baptist University, on the Texas Judicial Council and as a board member of the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute. In January 2021, he was appointed to serve on the Board of Directors of the Prestonwood Pregnancy Center. Jeff and his wife Becky, a speaker, writer and artist, are the proud parents of Brady, Charlotte and Landry. In addition to service with numerous other community organizations, Jeff and Becky are active members of Cottonwood Creek Church.
