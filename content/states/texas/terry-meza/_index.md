Rep. Terry Meza grew up in Irving, Texas - the heart of District 105. She is a proud graduate of Irving High School and she commuted from Irving for all her higher education pursuits to attend UT Arlington, The University of Dallas, and Texas Wesleyan University School of Law.

Rep. Meza started her career as a student teacher at South Grand Prairie High School and taught at every level from elementary school to college. She also worked as a nonprofit director overseeing programs in economic development, small & minority business assistance, neighborhood revitalization, historic preservation, workforce development, and job placement. Before serving in the legislature, Rep. Meza operated her own solo law practice for almost 20 years.

In the 2023 legislative session, Rep. Meza serves on the Environmental Regulation Committee, and the International Relations & Economic Development Committee.

She has been recognized with several awards for her work, including:
• The Hunger Leadership Award from Feeding America for her work on the Human Services Committee in the 86th Legislature
• 2019 Community Service Award from the American Muslim Women Physician Association
• 2020 Dr. Mae Jackson Outstanding Democratic Woman Officeholder Award.

She lives in Irving with her former neighbor from Austin - a cat named Cake (Que-Que).
