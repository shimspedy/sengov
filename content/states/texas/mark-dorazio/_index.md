Mark Dorazio has lived a principled life of service dedicated to God, family, community, and conservative values.

Mark was the 4th boy, born to a large Italian family of 10 children in Derry, PA. He started working and paying rent at age 12 delivering the local newspaper. He followed his oldest brother to Lubbock, TX out of high school, and apprenticed in construction under three engineers that taught at Texas Tech University. He met his wife, Monica in El Paso, and they have been married for 40 adventurous years. They raised four children, and now enjoy their eleven grandchildren. Together they opened their own construction company, Dorazio Enterprises, Inc., after moving to San Antonio. Over the last 38 years Mark and Monica have grown their business responsibly, operating most of that time as a debt free corporation. Mark started as a carpenter framing houses, then worked on a broad array of construction projects. He is now doing heavy industrial & civil construction for power companies, and infrastructure projects in San Antonio and surrounding areas.

For 23 years Mark has been a very active member of his church, Lifehouse, where he has served as an Elder, Council member, and Children’s Sunday School Teacher. He has participated in several local and international mission trips to bring support to churches, clinics, and schools. Mark has served on the board of The Justice Foundation, a legal defender advancing life, liberty, and justice for over 10 years.

Mark has served as a Republican Party Precinct Chairman for over 30 years and was elected by his fellow precinct chairmen to serve as the Bexar County Republican Party Chairman from 2017-2018. He conducted the local 2018 Primary Election and helped to plan the 2018 Republican State Convention in San Antonio. He was also elected to run the Bexar County Senate District 25 Convention as its chairman twice, including conducting it in San Antonio in 2020—overcoming all the obstacles caused by COVID and local government restrictions to do so.

He has attended 13 Republican Party of Texas (RPT) state conventions as a delegate, and most recently served as the 2020 RPT Platform Committee Chairman. This committee gives voice to more than ten thousand Republican delegates to county and senate district conventions which take place across Texas. At the 2020 State Convention the Republican delegates of Senate District 25 also elected Mark to his third term representing them on the State Republican Executive Committee—the governing body of the Texas GOP, where he has served on various committees. In 2016 he was an alternate to the National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. He also initiated, produced, and published the first Senate District/County Convention Manual that has been widely used across Texas to help organize and run County Conventions.

Mark understands the opportunities and blessings of this great country, and he is dedicated to ensuring that the American Dream is kept alive for future generations to come.
