Chairman Morgan Meyer is a vocal leader when it comes to public education, the fight against human trafficking, and fiscal responsibility. First elected in 2014 and now in his fifth term as a State Representative, Morgan serves as Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.

During his time in the legislature, Chairman Meyer has become a go-to leader for laws that protect our children against human trafficking and sex crimes. He has authored and led to pass Texas’ most comprehensive laws on trafficking, including expanding the definition of trafficking and making it easier to charge and prosecute human traffickers. For this work, Chairman Meyer was awarded the “Protect Her Award” from New Friends New Life, a leading advocate for exploited women and children. Additionally, for his work in support of prosecutors who hold these criminals accountable, he was awarded the “Law & Order Award” from the Texas District and County Attorneys Association. Morgan also has spearheaded legislation to battle against digital sexual harassment, filing a bill to criminalize the dissemination of unsolicited explicit images.

As the only member of the Public Education Committee from North Texas in 2019, Chairman Meyer played an instrumental role in the passage of HB 3, the transformative school finance bill. In addition to increasing the per-student daily allotment, reducing statewide recapture, funding essential programs like Pre-K, dyslexia identification and dual-language learning, HB 3 delivered hundreds of millions of dollars to school districts in HD 108 over the biennium through new funds and reduced recapture.

Now in his second term as Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Meyer has led the charge to lower property taxes, provided hundreds of millions in property tax relief each year, and given homeowners more tools in protesting their home appraisals. In addition, he has focused on promoting economic recovery and smart, innovative approaches to tax reform and relief while still ensuring we fully fund priorities like education and public safety.

In previous legislative sessions, Meyer has served as the Chair of the House Committee on General Investigating, and as a member of the Public Education, State Affairs, Energy, and Insurance committees. Upholding conservative principles, he has earned awards such as “Conservative Champion” by the Texas Conservative Coalition, “Exemplary Conservative Lawmaker” by the Conservative Roundtable of Texas, “Champion for Free Enterprise” by the Texas Association of Business, “Legislative Hero” by the Texas Access to Justice Foundation for his commitment to fighting for access to justice, “Friend of the Taxpayer” by Americans for Prosperity, Texas Chapter, and “Conservative Achievement” by the American Conservative Union Foundation.

Chairman Meyer represents House District 108 which encompasses parts of Downtown Dallas, Uptown Dallas, East Dallas (including portions of the M Streets and Lakewood), Preston Hollow, North Dallas, Lake Highlands, the City of University Park, and the Town of Highland Park. Some of the most notable landmarks in the Dallas area are found inside the boundaries of the district, including portions of the Downtown Central Business District, Southern Methodist University, the American Airlines Center, and Klyde Warren Park.

Morgan and his wife, Keana, have lived in various parts of District 108 for over 20 years. The Meyers currently reside in University Park with their three children, Katharine, Elizabeth, and Asher. As community activists, Morgan and Keana are both passionate advocates of local organizations that combat child trafficking and help support women who seek shelter from abusive relationships. Morgan is also a member of Hyer Elementary School Dad’s Club. The Meyer family attends Highland Park United Methodist Church, where they have been involved with the children’s ministry.

Chairman Meyer is a partner at Wick Phillips law firm and has more than two decades of experience protecting business interests. He received his undergraduate degree from Southern Methodist University and his law degree from Washington and Lee School of Law. Morgan has been named a “Rising Star” by Texas Super Lawyers eight times. He is particularly devoted to using his professional training as an attorney to provide legal services to those who could not otherwise afford them. Through the Dallas Volunteer Attorney Program, Morgan has volunteered at the South Dallas Legal Clinic, the Housing Legal Clinic, and the VA Hospital Clinic. Morgan is also involved in the Lawyers Serving Warriors Program, which provides free representation to injured veterans to help them secure benefits based upon combat-related injuries.
