Kevin is a conservative businessman and community leader in Midland, Texas, with deep West Texas roots.

Growing up in Midland, Kevin graduated from Robert E. Lee High School in 1982, earning his Eagle Scout Award. Kevin received a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin in 1985 and then returned home to Midland, where he began his nearly 40-year career in the oil and gas industry. Working for Discovery Operating, Kevin learned the family business first as a pumper and roustabout, and currently serves as the company's Chief Executive Officer.

Kevin and his wife, Jill, raised their four children in Midland and are enjoying their growing family, welcoming their first grandchild earlier this year with another arriving soon.

For over 30 years, the Sparks have served their community as Young Life and church leaders. Kevin and Jill are active Stonegate Fellowship members, where Kevin serves as an elder. The Sparks lead small-groups and mentor young couples bringing-up their own families.

Kevin has also served on the board of High Sky Children's Ranch, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, and the Natural Gas Producers Association. Kevin currently serves as a trustee at Midland Classical Academy. An avid outdoorsman, Kevin can be found hunting and fly fishing when heâ€™s not spending time with his family.
