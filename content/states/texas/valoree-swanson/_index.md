Valoree Swanson was sworn in as the State Representative for House District 150 on January 10, 2017. A sixth-generation Texan and mother of four grown children, Valoree has strong Texas family roots. After years of homeschooling and sports with her two biological children, she and her husband, Vern, adopted two teenage girls from CPS. Prior to raising children, Valoree worked in commercial real estate, after getting her Bachelor's of Business Administration from Baylor University. Valoree's oldest daughter is a former criminal prosecutor, and her son is a petroleum engineer. Devout Christians, Valoree and Vern have been members of WoodsEdge Community Church for 13 years, where they have served in various ministries. Valoree has been involved in the community for years as a children's Bible study and Sunday school leader, a children's sports team representative and referee, a member of various boards, and in ministries serving the elderly.

Valoree was politically involved at an early age. By her own admission, she loves to campaign and is a fierce competitor. She has volunteered during every election cycle in innumerable campaigns and capacities over the years. The (party) Party of Texas recognized Valoree for her tremendous volunteer work in campaigns and other organizations, by awarding her the 2015 Volunteer of the Year for the entire Senate District 7. She served as State (party) Executive Committeewoman for Senate District 7 from 2006-2014, as Precinct Chair for 23 years, and was elected to many (party) Party committees.
