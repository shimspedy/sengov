Nicole Collier is a respected attorney, small business owner, grandmother and mother of three who has spent her life working to obtain the American Dream. As a single mother of two children before finishing high school, she was bolstered by both her faith and her family to continue her education. Nicole is a graduate of the University of Houston and Texas Wesleyan University School of Law, now the Texas A&M University School of Law. For the last 20 years, Nicole has been a strong advocate for individuals and families, and has now taken her skills to the Texas Capitol.

Nicole is the first woman to represent Tarrant County’s House District 95, and in November 2022, she was re-elected to her sixth term in office.

In the prior session, Nicole served as chair of the House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence, which made her the first woman in Texas history to chair the committee since it was formed in 1879. Nicole has also served as chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus. In the 88th Texas Legislature, she was chosen to serve as Second Vice Chair to the House Democratic Caucus. Additionally, Nicole was re-appointed to serve on the House Committee on Public Health and newly appointed to the House Committee on Culture, Recreation & Tourism.

Nicole draws her legislative priorities from input from the community. She has filed legislation that focuses on affordable housing, renters’ rights, access to quality healthcare, and criminal justice reform. Her outstanding legislative achievements have garnered numerous awards, including, more recently, the Roy Wilkins Civil Rights Award from the NAACP, and the Regional Legislator of the Year Award from The National Black Caucus of State Legislators.
