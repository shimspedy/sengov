First sworn-in to the Texas House of Representatives in 2021, State Representative David Cook is currently serving his second term representing Texas House District 96, which encompasses the cities of Arlington, Burleson, Crowley, Fort Worth, Kennedale, Mansfield, and Rendon in Tarrant County.

During the 88th Session of the Texas Legislature, Speaker Dade Phelan appointed Representative Cook to serve as Vice Chairman of the House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee as well as a member of the House Calendars and Juvenile Justice & Family Issues Committees. Representative Cook currently serves as the Vice Chair of the Texas House Republican Caucus Policy Committee, as a Member of the Innovation & Technology (IT) Caucus Policy Committee, and as a Member of the House Criminal Justice Reform, Manufacturing, and Sportsmen Caucuses. Representative Cook was nominated by Speaker Dade Phelan as a 2023 GOPAC “Emerging Leader” and serves as the State Chair for the National Association of Christian Lawmakers (NACL).

As a graduate of Stephen F. Austin State University and Texas A&M University School of Law (previously, Texas Wesleyan University School of Law), Representative Cook brings extensive legal expertise to the Legislature as Managing Partner of Harris Cook L.L.P., a firm he co-founded with the late State Senator Chris Harris. Representative Cook is Board Certified in Family Law by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization.

Representative Cook possesses a lifelong dedication to public service, having previously served as Mayor of the City of Mansfield from 2008 to 2021. His accolades include the Mansfield News Mirror’s “Best Local Government Official” Award, the Fort Worth Business Press’ “40 Under 40” Award, and the Fort Worth Texas Magazine’s “Top Attorney” Award.

He and his wife Tonya remain active in serving their local community through non-profits such as Mansfield Cares, Mansfield Mission Center, and Mansfield Feed the Kids Summer Program, community organizations such as the Mansfield Area Chamber of Commerce and Mansfield Historical Society, and community events such as the Mansfield Veterans’ Day Parade & Salute and the World’s Only St. Paddy’s Pickle Parade. Rep. Cook also currently serves on the Advisory Council for the Arlington Mansfield Area Salvation Army.

Representative and Mrs. Cook are members of Walnut Ridge Baptist Church in Mansfield. He was also instrumental in establishing Mansfield Churches FOR the City, which is a group of pastors and churches dedicated to the glorification of God through service to the City of Mansfield. They have four adult children, one daughter-in-law, two sons-in-law, and four grandchildren.
