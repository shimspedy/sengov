State Representative Chris Turner has served Tarrant County in the Texas Legislature for six terms, representing parts of Arlington and Grand Prairie.

As a state representative, Chris has worked to increase opportunity for all Texans. Chris created the Veterans Cash scratch-off ticket that has raised more than $150 million to aid Texas veterans. He also authored the constitutional amendment to create a 100% property tax exemption for surviving spouses of servicemembers killed in the line of duty. He played a pivotal role in the passage of payday lending ordinances in both Arlington and Grand Prairie and has authored laws that safeguard consumers from unexpected utility rate hikes and tenants from unscrupulous landlords.

In 2019, Chris brokered the deal to end the stalemate on Texas' major school finance legislation by crafting a statewide teacher pay raise plan that was ultimately supported by both the House and Senate. As chair of the House Committee on Higher Education during the 86th Legislature, Chris was instrumental in passing several transformative higher education policies, including sponsoring SB 25, which improves the transferability of college credits among institutions of higher education.

In February 2021, Chris was appointed to serve as Chairman of the House Committee on Business & Industry. Chris also serves on the House Committee on Redistricting and the House Committee on Higher Education.

Chris served as Chair of the House Democratic Caucus from 2017-2022, where he lead members with a comprehensive strategic approach to advance better public policy.

A lifelong Texan, Chris grew up in Dallas and has lived in Tarrant County for more than 20 years. Chris is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin and works as a communications consultant when he is not working in the Legislature. Chris and his wife, Lisa, live in Grand Prairie with their rescue dogs, Cassie, Cora and Cleo.
