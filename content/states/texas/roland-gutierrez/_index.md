Senator Gutierrez, his wife Sarah, and their daughters Izabella and Victoria live in the Mission San Jose neighborhood. They are members of the Mission San Jose Parish and are active in a variety of community projects.

As a state representative, Gutierrez served as Chairman of the Defense and Veterans' Affairs Committee during the 85th legislative session. In the 85th legislative session, Gutierrez established the National Warrior Resiliency Center in San Antonio focusing on PTSD treatment across the state. He also successfully passed measures protecting our Texas military bases from closure during the 2017 special session. In 86th legislative session, Senator Gutierrez fought for state funding of the San Antonio State Hospital; as a result of his tireless work, San Antonio will be building a new state hospital.

During his tenure on the San Antonio City Council, Senator Gutierrez was instrumental in establishing Texas A&M University at San Antonio and securing federal resources to fund the San Antonio River project without increasing the tax burden on middle-class families and small businesses. Senator Gutierrezâ€™ efforts led to the construction of the first library on the south side of San Antonio in more than 30 years, Mission Branch Library.

Born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, Senator Gutierrez is a 1989 graduate of Central Catholic High School. He earned his BA in Political Science from the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1995 and his law degree from St. Mary's University School of Law in 1998. He is the Founder and President of the Gutierrez Law Firm, specializing in immigration law.
