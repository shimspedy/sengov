When Representative Christina Morales' grandparents, Felix H. and Angela V. Morales, came to Houston in 1931, they began a family tradition of community-building. At the time, few funeral homes in Houston offered dignified burials to Latino families. They established Morales Funeral Home in 1931 and founded KLVL La Voz Latina, the fist Spanish-language radio station to broadcast news for the Gulf Coast, in 1946. It is from this upbringing that Christina learned to view the community as her family and build on the work that her grandparents began.

At age 23, following the death of her grandmother, Christina assumed ownership of Morales Funeral Home. She would continue to uphold its reputation for excellent service, forming long-lasting bonds with the families she consoled in their darkest hour. Under Christina's leadership, Morales Funeral Home has become a Houston institution and a pillar of the Second Ward community.

In 1997, Christina built on her grandparents' legacy of community engagement by establishing the Annual Morales Back to School Supplies Giveaway. Twenty-four years later, the program continues to serve more than 2,000 students each year, providing school supplies to families in Houston's most underprivileged communities.

Determined to expand her commitment to the community where she was raised, Christina successfully ran for State Representative in House District 145 in 2019. She is proud to represent the people of Harris County and has garnered praise from her colleagues for her exceptional constituent engagement. During the 87th Legislature, Christina supported public education, worked to expand ethnic studies across the state, passed consumer protection bills, and fought to defend voting rights. Currently in her third session, the 88th Legislative Session, Christina serves on the International Relations & Economic Development Committee, Criminal Jurisprudence Committee, and the Resolutions Calendar Committee. Her work goes beyond the Legislature, hosting frequent food and school supply distributions as well as community events such as a college readiness fair and laptop giveaway.

Christina is blessed with two children and twin grandsons. She currently serves as President, CEO, and Funeral Director of Morales Funeral Home and President of the Morales Memorial Foundation.
