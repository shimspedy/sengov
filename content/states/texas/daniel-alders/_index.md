Representative Daniel Alders, a member of the Republican Party, serves in the Texas House of Representatives representing District 6. He assumed office on January 14, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 12, 2027.

Daniel Alders is a seventh-generation Texan whose roots trace back to 1836 in rural East Texas. Born in Dallas, Texas, he grew up on a family farm in Nacogdoches County, where he developed a deep appreciation for the values of hard work and community. He pursued higher education at New Saint Andrews College in Moscow, Idaho, earning a degree in Liberal Arts in 2009. Shortly after, he married his wife, Joanna, and the couple returned to East Texas to begin their life together.

Alders embarked on a career in real estate before transitioning to public service. In 2015, he moved to Tyler, Texas, where he served as the East Texas Regional Director for Senator Ted Cruz. In this role, he acted as the Senator’s primary liaison to business owners, organizations, community leaders, and constituents across a thirty-five-county region. His dedication to fostering connections and addressing community concerns earned him recognition as a committed advocate for East Texas.

In 2017, Alders returned to the private sector as the Executive Property Manager and President of Drake Management Services. Despite his professional commitments, he remained actively involved in the Tyler community. He chaired the Tyler Area Chamber of Commerce Government Affairs Committee and led the Tyler Chapter of the Texas Public Policy Foundation's Liberty Leadership Council Program. His leadership extended to his church, where he served on the diaconate at Fifth Street Presbyterian Church, and to Unbound Now’s Smith County Advisory Board, demonstrating his commitment to both faith and community service.

Daniel Alders and his wife, Joanna, are proud parents of two daughters, Trinity and Madeleine. His journey from a rural upbringing to a prominent role in the Texas House of Representatives reflects his dedication to serving his community and upholding the values that define East Texas. As a legislator, Alders continues to focus on policies that promote economic growth, community development, and the well-being of his constituents in District 6.
