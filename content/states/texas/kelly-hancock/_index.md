First elected to the Texas Senate in 2012, Kelly Hancock represents Senate District 9 in Tarrant County. He previously served in the Texas House of Representatives and remains an advocate for core conservative values of limited government and lower taxes.

Throughout his legislative career, Senator Hancock has worked diligently to keep government out of the way of Texas' job-creators and plan ahead for the growth associated with our stateâ€™s thriving economy. He has also passed model legislation to protect consumers from surprise medical bills and give Texas the most conservative state spending cap in the nation.

As a consistent advocate for key issues such as property tax reform, education freedom, and border security, Senator Hancock has earned recognition as a "Courageous Conservative," a "Champion of Small Business," and a "Lone Star Conservative Leader."

A graduate of Baylor University, Senator Hancock possesses an extensive business background and runs his family-founded distribution company. His commitment to public service began shortly after the birth of his first child. As a parent dedicated to a strong education system, Senator Hancock spent the next 13 years serving on his local school board.

He and his wife, Robin, have been married 35 years and have three children: Chloe (Greg), Skylar (Aaron) and Harrison (Parker). They proudly welcomed their first grandchild in 2018 and two more in 2021, with another on the way in 2023!
