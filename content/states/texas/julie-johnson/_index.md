Representative Julie Johnson was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 2018 and is currently serving in her third term for House District 115. HD 115 is one of the most diverse districts in Texas and includes the cities of Addison, Carrollton, Coppell, Dallas, Irving, and Farmers Branch. In the 88th Legislative Session, Rep. Johnson was appointed to the House Committee on Insurance and the House Committee on Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence, where she serves as Vice Chair.

Rep. Johnson continues to fight for consumer protection issues and expanding access and affordability within our healthcare system. For her hardworking efforts, Rep. Johnson was named the 2019 'Freshman of the Year' by Texas Monthly, ‘Champion of Medicine’ by the Texas Medical Association, and ‘Big Voices for Little Texans’ Award by Texas CASA.

Rep. Johnson is a member of many House Caucuses to address the needs in HD 115. Currently, she is a member of the House Democratic Caucus, Vice Chair of the Women’s Health Caucus, Treasurer of the Texas House LGBTQ Caucus, Early Childhood Caucus, Innovation & Technology Caucus, and the Sportsmen's Caucus.

When Rep. Johnson is back home in the district, she is an attorney that specializes in personal injury cases, family law, and mediation. She has represented thousands of clients in the DFW area and has been in practice since 1991.
