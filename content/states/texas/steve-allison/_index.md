State Representative Steve Allison represents House District 121, succeeding former Speaker of the House Joe Straus. District 121 covers parts of north central and northeast San Antonio, as well as the cities of Alamo Heights, Olmos Park, and Terrell Hills.

Representative Allison serves on the following committees: Appropriations, Public Education, Local and Consent Calendars, and the Select Committee on Youth Health & Safety. He is also a member of the Water Caucus. Steve previously served two sessions on the Public Health Committee and the Republican Caucus Policy Committee.

Representative Allison has been recognized as “Friend of Education” by TCEA, “Champion of Education” by TASB, “Best of the House” by CLEAT, “100% Vote for Medicine” by TMA, and awarded the Shield Award by Parents and Allies for Remarkable Texans.

Steve brings significant background, community service, and leadership experience to his role in the House. He has a history of active involvement and accomplishments in numerous civic organizations and professional, business, education, health care, and other community interests and activities.

Representative Allison has been particularly active and involved in his children’s schools and in education issues, including twelve years on the Alamo Heights ISD Board of Trustees, including three terms as President, a member of the District’s Early Childhood Task Force, Vice Chairman of the District’s Legislative Committee, sponsor of Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Board member of the District’s support group, and Chair of the District’s Task Force on Character Education, Wellness and Digital Citizenship. He has been actively involved with school finance and “Robin Hood” recapture issues, including being instrumental in keeping Alamo Heights ISD’s recapture funds in the Bexar County community for funding of the legislative mandated juvenile justice academy program. Also while President, he chaired a community task force which lead to the creation of the Robbins Academy, a non-disciplinary alternative program for at-risk students. During his tenure on the Board of Trustees, he was appointed to the Texas Association of School Board’s statewide Special Committee on Revenue and Funding and later served three years as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Association. The year before his election to the House, Steve completed eight years as a member of the Board of Trustees of VIA Metropolitan Transit Authority, including the last two years as Vice Chairman of the Board.

Professionally, Steve is a highly regarded attorney, concentrating in business litigation and health care, and is a trained and experienced mediator and arbitrator. He has been repeatedly recognized in Best Lawyers in America (“Commercial Litigation” and “Bet the Company Litigation”) and Texas Super Lawyers (“Business Litigation”).

Representative Allison is a graduate of Texas Christian University and the University of Houston Law Center.

Steve and his wife, Peggy, met their freshman year at TCU and have been married for 53 years. They have two sons, Brian and Todd; six grandchildren, Taylor, Scott, Corbin, Emma, Maggie, and George; and a golden retriever, Duffy, who is a valued campaigner and goes everywhere with them. Peggy and Steve are longstanding members of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church, where both have taught children’s Sunday school and Steve has served on the Vestry.
