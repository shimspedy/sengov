While attending TSU, Johnson accepted the position Executive Director for the Phoenix Outreach Youth Center.

In 2005, Jarvis Johnson was elected to the Houston City Council to represent District B, making him one of the youngest Council Members in history. By negotiating development within his district, Johnson was able to ensure people from the local community were hired, while also injecting the district with economic activity from new projects. One of his greatest achievements as a Council Member was securing a $3.5 million federal grant to establish a performing arts precinct for Texas Southern University in the 5th ward.

These efforts have been recognized both within Houston and at the national level. From the Houston Business Connection, Ebony, Black Enterprise, and Rolling Stone, the media has taken notice of Jarvis Johnson's record of service.

This event, allowed senior citizens to voice their concerns in a Town Hall meeting. He has also advocated for community engagement through the District 139 Youth Task Force, the Business Source Task Force, and the District 139 Student Internship Program. Given the diversity of the district, he will also host classes on both English as a second language, and Spanish.
