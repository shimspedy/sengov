Heriberto “Eddie” Morales Jr. is a lifelong resident of Eagle Pass, Texas. He is currently serving as State Representative for District 74, the largest and most unique district in Texas. The District is made up of 11 counties extending from his hometown in Eagle Pass, Maverick County to the north east portion of El Paso County and includes over 770 border miles with Mexico.

Prior to his public service, Representative Morales attended Eagle Pass High School and after graduating, pursued a bachelor’s degree in Political Science and a double minor in Business and Spanish from the University of Texas at Austin graduating in 1997. He then attended St. Mary’s University School of Law, graduated with his Juris Doctorate in 2000, and in that same year he passed the State Bar exam.

In addition to serving as State Representative, Morales is also a partner and member of the management board at Langley and Banack, Inc., Attorneys at Law, and currently supervises their satellite office in Eagle Pass. He was past President of the Maverick County Bar Association and now sits on the St. Mary's Law Alumni Association as a Board Member. He is a City Attorney for Eagle Pass and Brackettville, and he is an avid real estate investor, as well as a commercial and residential builder. He is also the owner of the family’s tortilla factory business, called “The Piedras Negras Tortilla Factory”, which is a staple of the Eagle Pass food culture which recently celebrated its 34th anniversary of being in business.

Representative Morales has served with focus and integrity throughout his career as an attorney, a businessman, and an investor. With over 22 years of experience, and a commitment to strengthening the community, he has brought the same transparency and responsibility to District 74 since 2020. Under his leadership as a Representative, he and his team passed more than 30 legislative bills during his freshman year at the Capitol. By listening and considering the views of every constituent, District 74 has been well represented on issues such as border security, healthcare, job creation, transportation infrastructure, education, school safety, mental health, and protecting the environment, among others.

Representative Morales is proud of his legislative accomplishments, but more importantly, of his three children: Kassandra, who has worked as a public educator and is now finishing her Clinical Counseling Masters degree; Alexandra, currently working as a special needs educator in San Marcos; and his son Eddie, who is a recent graduate of the University of Texas and currently attending St. Mary’s Law School. Last but not least, his wife Hellen has been an inspiration and an integral part of a successful 87th legislative session. She serves as another advocate for House District 74, and has made key connections in the Capitol.

Morales has been focused on representing every city, county, and citizen of the District 74 communities. He is a proud Democrat, willing to reach across the aisle and work with Republicans and Independents for the betterment of Texas.
