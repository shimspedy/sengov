Cynthia is a two-time graduate of the University of New Mexico (UNM), earning a Bachelor of Science in Education from UNM’s College of Education, and a Master’s Degree in Public Administration. Her academic achievements laid a solid foundation for her future career in public service.

Before her political career, Cynthia worked for the City of Albuquerque as a City Planner for over 28 years. During her tenure, she managed the Metropolitan Redevelopment Agency, contributing significantly to the city's development. She also owned and operated Cyba & Assoc., LLC, a planning, development, sales, and consultation company. In addition to this, she ran a small retail business showcasing artisan jewelry and collectibles in Los Ranchos de Albuquerque.

Cynthia's political career began with her election to the Albuquerque City Council, where she served from 2017 to 2021. During her time on the council, she held the position of Vice-President in 2019 and chaired the Council’s Land Use and Zoning Committee. Her leadership and dedication to public service were evident in her work.

In addition to her roles in city planning and the city council, Cynthia has held several other significant positions. She twice served as the Chairman of the New Mexico Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA), where she helped secure and expand PERA’s $14 billion-dollar retirement fund during the global Great Recession in 2009. She was also the Vice-Chair of the Mid Region Council of Governments Transportation Board in 2021.

Cynthia's commitment to her community extends beyond her professional roles. She has served as the Board Chair of the Rio Grande Credit Union and the ABC Community Schools Board.

Currently, she is the President of UNM School of Public Administration Advisory Alumni Board.

Throughout her career, Cynthia has prioritized working to sustain a balanced budget, increasing the number of police, expanding mental health programs, improving children’s welfare, advancing youth education programs, improving transportation and infrastructure, catalyzing economic development, and increasing government transparency. Her dedication to these issues reflects her commitment to improving the lives of the people she represents.
