Joshua Hernandez is a proud New Mexico native, born and raised in this magnificent state. He grew up witnessing the unwavering determination of his hardworking parents as they built their small business from scratch. Their commitment to success instilled in him the value of hard work, dedication, and the importance of family.

As a State Representative, Joshua is devoted to advocating for small businesses, which he believes are the backbone of our economy. He is committed to addressing the challenges they face, including overreaching regulations and outdated tax codes.

Joshua's educational journey began in a private religious elementary school before transitioning to Albuquerque Public Schools in the third grade. He is a proud graduate of Cibola High School and is currently completing his associate’s degree at CNM. He is thrilled to have been accepted into Western New Mexico University this fall, where he will be pursuing a bachelor’s degree in political science.

Throughout his diverse career, Joshua has gained unique perspectives and valuable experiences working in various industries, from retail to managing a staff of over 200 at a golf course and country club. Currently, he serves as the Digital Director for an international public affairs, strategic communications, and advocacy firm based in Albuquerque.

Elected in 2020 at the age of 35, Joshua was one of the youngest members of the State House of Representatives, providing a fresh voice and perspective for the next generation of New Mexicans. He is determined to keep bringing his diverse background, conservative values, and bold leadership to Santa Fe, producing tangible, positive results for Rio Rancho and the entire state.

In his first two terms, Joshua sponsored and passed groundbreaking legislation, including liquor license reform, leading to hundreds of new restaurants across our state. In 2023, he championed a first in the nation piece of legislation to help members of the limb loss & limb difference community receive the prosthetics they need to stay active, and changing healthcare credentialing laws to help patients see their doctor faster.

Joshua views himself not as a politician, but as a representative voice for the people of District 60, located in the heart of Rio Rancho. He is eager to continue working with and advocating for the residents and businesses in our vibrant community, striving to make a lasting, positive impact on the lives of all those who call this incredible place home.
