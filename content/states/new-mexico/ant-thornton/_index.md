Anthony L. Thornton, also known as Ant Thornton, is a member of the Republican Party serving in the New Mexico State Senate. Representing District 19, he assumed office on January 1, 2025, and his current term is set to end on December 31, 2028.

Born in Fairfield, California, Thornton's journey to public service is as diverse as it is inspiring. He began his academic pursuits at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where he earned a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering in 1978. He furthered his education with a master's degree from Stanford University in 1980 and a Ph.D. from Purdue University in 1992. His professional career is marked by significant contributions to aerospace engineering, including his tenure at Sandia National Laboratories, where he became the first Black American Executive Director in 1994. Thornton also held executive roles at Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs, famously known as Skunk Works.

Thornton's career extended beyond engineering. He served in the U.S. Navy Reserve from 1983 to 1990, showcasing his commitment to national service. After retiring from Sandia in 2015, he transitioned into a strategic role at the Universities Space Research Association, where he played a pivotal role in expanding the organization's revenue.

In addition to his professional achievements, Thornton has been deeply involved in community service. He has served on various boards aimed at improving STEM education in rural communities and has supported local charitable initiatives. His dedication to public service led him to politics, where he was elected as the 1st Vice Chair of the Republican Party of Bernalillo County in 2021. In 2022, he was the GOP nominee for Lieutenant Governor, advocating for individual liberty and freedom.

Thornton's decision to enter the New Mexico State Senate was driven by his desire to address critical issues such as crime and education reform. He believes in implementing stronger policies to combat criminal activities and has advocated for educational reforms inspired by successful models from other states. His technical background and diverse experiences provide him with a unique perspective on governance, making him a significant figure in New Mexico's political landscape.

Thornton resides in the East Mountains of Albuquerque with his wife, Glenna. Together, they remain active in their local community and church, embodying a life of service and dedication.
