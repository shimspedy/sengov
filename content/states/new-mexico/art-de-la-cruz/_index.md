Art De La Cruz is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives from the 12th district. He was appointed to this position on February 3, 2022. Prior to this, De La Cruz had represented the same district from September 2020 to January 2021.

Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, De La Cruz pursued his education at the University of New Mexico where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in university studies. He furthered his education at the University of Phoenix, where he obtained a Master of Science in management and human relations.

Before his political career, De La Cruz served as an employee of the Public Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico for 46 years. He also operated a small business, demonstrating his entrepreneurial spirit.

In September 2020, De La Cruz was appointed to the New Mexico House of Representatives following the resignation of Patricio Ruiloba. In the 2020 election for the seat, De La Cruz ran as a Democratic write-in candidate. However, he lost to independent candidate Brittney Barreras and left office on January 19, 2021.

In a turn of events, Brittney Barreras announced her resignation from the House of Representatives on January 28, 2022. Following this, the Bernalillo County commission appointed De La Cruz to fill Barreras' position on February 2, 2022. He was sworn into office the next day.

De La Cruz's tenure has been marked by his commitment to his constituents and his dedication to public service. His experience and knowledge gained from his previous roles have undoubtedly contributed to his effectiveness as a representative.

As of now, Art De La Cruz holds the office of New Mexico House of Representatives - District 12 until January 21, 2025. He is also running for re-election to the New Mexico House of Representatives to represent District 12. The Democratic primary is scheduled for June 4, 2024.
