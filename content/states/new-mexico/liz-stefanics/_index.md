Senator Liz Stefanics (D-District 39) is serving her third term in New Mexico’s State Senate. She originally held the position from 1993-96. Voters returned her to the State Senate in 2016 and 2020.

​

Liz was raised in a working-class family who impressed upon her the value of hard work, education, and service to others. Her father was a WWII veteran, a blue-collar worker who made his living as an airplane mechanic. Her mother was a homemaker, raising Liz and her brothers. The kids went to Catholic school because Liz’s parents believed a strong education guaranteed opportunity.
 
Liz moved to New Mexico over 35 years ago to teach at UNM. She fell in love with the Land of Enchantment and made it her home. In addition to being an educator, Liz has run a non-profit organization to improve the lives of the elderly and disabled; championed opportunities for children and families and better health care; and served as a Santa Fe County Commissioner. Liz has her PH.D. from the University of Minnesota, her MS from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her BS from Eastern Kentucky University.
 
A lover of the outdoors, Liz is an avid hiker and kayaker who takes advantage of New Mexico's vast natural wonders every chance she gets.
