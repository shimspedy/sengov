William F. Burt, a Republican politician, has served in the New Mexico Senate since January 15, 2013, representing District 33. Prior to this, he held the District 40 seat, having been appointed by Governor Susana Martinez on January 14, 2011, to fill the vacancy left by Senator Dianna Duran's resignation. Burt's commitment to public service spans over 14 years, during which he was re-elected in 2016 and 2020 by significant margins.

Education:
- Bachelor's degree from New Mexico State University.

Elections:
- In 2012, Burt was redistricted to District 33. He ran unopposed in the Republican Primary, securing 3,954 votes, and won the November 6, 2012 General election with 12,292 votes (65.3%) against Democratic nominee Stephanie Dubois.

Senator Burt's dedication to his constituents and his party has made a lasting impact on New Mexico's legislative landscape. His retirement announcement marks the end of an era, and he will continue to serve until the completion of his term in 2024.
