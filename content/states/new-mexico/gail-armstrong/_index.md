Gail Armstrong, also known as Missy, is an American politician and businesswoman who is currently serving as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives from the 49th district. She assumed office in 2017 and her current term ends on December 31, 2024.

Born in Socorro, New Mexico, Armstrong was raised on a ranch near Magdalena, New Mexico. She is a lifelong resident of the area and has strong roots and a deep love for the communities she serves. Before being appointed to the House of Representatives to represent District 49, Armstrong served her community in many ways.

In addition to her political career, Armstrong has also founded and operated several small businesses, including a plumbing company and a boutique hotel. She has also been involved in numerous sub-committees while the House was not in session.

Prior to serving in the New Mexico House of Representatives, Armstrong was a member of the committee that organizes the Socorro County Fair. She was also a board member and one-time president of the Magdalena Municipal School District. She served on the board of the Natural Lands Protection Committee and New Mexico School Board Association, New Mexico Sentencing Commission, and New Mexico State Apprenticeship Council.

Armstrong also worked as a political aide in the office of House Speaker Don Tripp, who she succeeded upon Tripp's retirement. In 2019, Armstrong voted against a bill to expand background checks on private firearms, citing the potential difficulty of enforcing new regulations in rural New Mexico.

Armstrong and her husband, Dale, have four children. As a businesswoman, rancher, mother, and wife, Armstrong is focused on preserving Catron, Socorro, and Valencia counties. She is committed to focusing on areas of "common ground" that unite rather than divide us. She is working diligently to improve educational opportunities, economic development and reducing crime in our communities.
