Javier Martínez is the New Mexico State Representative from District 11 and serves as the 31st Speaker of the NM House. Javier sits on the House Judiciary and House Taxation and Revenue Committees. 

Javier’s rise to the Speakership is a testament to his ability to work across ideological and party lines, and for always putting the needs of working families first. 

In his 9 years in the legislature, Javier has led the fight to build a more inclusive economy by expanding the NM Working Families Tax Credit, making it one of the most generous and inclusive in the country. Javier also championed the NM Child Tax Credit and was a long time sponsor of House Joint Resolution 1, which created a constitutional right for every child to have access to quality early childhood education and development.

Javier has been a tireless advocate for New Mexico's communities for more than two decades. Javier’s career started in 2000 as a community organizer in Albuquerque’s historic Barelas, Wells Park, and Sawmill neighborhoods. As an organizer, Javier developed a reputation for being highly effective as a consensus builder, a tough negotiator, and an advocate for working families.

Over time, Javier’s work extended to Albuquerque’s North and South Valleys and International District, working with neighborhoods to improve public safety, public schools, and to secure public infrastructure projects.

Javier’s story is predicated upon the American Dream. His parents, Javier and Ana, came to New Mexico in search of a better future for their two children, Javier and Viridiana. Javier is a product of Albuquerque's public schools and 2010 graduated from the University of New Mexico, becoming the first in his family to attend and graduate from college. After graduation, Javier worked as a public health advocate for the University of Michigan and organized communities in Bolivia, Peru, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic.

In 2010, Javier graduated from the UNM School of Law with honors in International and Comparative Law and the Southwest Indian Law Clinic. Since then, Javier has continued his dedicated advocacy on behalf of New Mexico's most vulnerable families at the local, state, and national levels. He has fought to ensure access to health care for all families, advocated for smart growth policies, pushed for permanent investments in early childhood education, and fought tirelessly to protect civil rights for all.

Javier is an avid fan of baseball and lucha libre. He lives in the Los Duranes neighborhood with his wife Diana and their two children. You can often find the Martinez family at the Edward C. Sandoval North Valley Little League Complex enjoying a baseball game.
