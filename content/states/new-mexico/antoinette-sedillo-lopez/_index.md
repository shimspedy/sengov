Senator Antoinette Sedillo Lopez became State Senator for NM Senate District 16 in January 2019. She is a long-time community leader, deeply committed to addressing critical social, economic, environmental, and civil rights issues affecting the lives of all New Mexicans.

**Background and Education:**
Antoinette grew up in the small New Mexico farming village of Los Chavez. She attended the University of New Mexico (UNM) and later pursued her legal education at UCLA School of Law. In 1986, she discovered her passion for teaching when she became a law professor at UNM School of Law. Notably, she became the first Latina to earn tenure at the School of Law.

**Legal Career and Scholarship:**
During her 27-year career as a law professor, Antoinette published books, articles, and poems. She organized and presented at numerous legal education conferences, earning several awards for excellence, service, and leadership. Her dedication to teaching extended beyond the classroom, as she led UNM's legal clinic, where law students provided pro bono legal assistance to community members.

**Advocacy Against Domestic Violence:**
In 2014, Antoinette left the Law School to head up Enlace Communitario, a non-profit organization focused on anti-domestic violence advocacy and services for the Latino immigrant community in Central New Mexico. Her work at Enlace further solidified her commitment to social justice and community well-being.

**Political Journey:**
In 2017, Antoinette was recruited to run for Congress in New Mexico's 1st Congressional District. Although she did not win her first race, an opportunity arose when Senator Cisco McSorely resigned to join the Lujan Grisham administration. Antoinette applied for the vacancy, was selected by the Bernalillo County Commission, and appointed by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. She subsequently won her race to keep the senate seat in the general election on November 3, 2020, securing 78% of the vote. Notably, she became the first woman and the first Hispanic to represent District 16.

**Legislative Commitment:**
As a state senator, Antoinette diligently participates in interim legislative hearings. She serves on various committees, including Water and Natural Resources, Courts, Corrections and Justice, Legislative Health and Human Services, Investment, Pensions and Oversight, and Legislative Council. Her focus remains on passing effective laws and policies that benefit all New Mexicans and reflect the will of her district in SE Albuquerque.

Senator Antoinette Sedillo Lopez is responsive to her constituents, actively engaging with New Mexicans to discuss issues and needs. Her legal expertise, community involvement, and unwavering commitment make her a valuable advocate for the people of New Mexico.
