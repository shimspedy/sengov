Dayan Hochman-Vigil, often known as "Day", is an American attorney and politician who is currently serving as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives from the 15th district. This district includes a portion of Bernalillo County. She was elected to the position in 2018 and immediately became a leader in criminal justice reform and transparency in government.

Born and raised in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Dayan comes from hard-working New Mexican roots. Her father was a local doctor, rancher, and small business owner outside of Glorieta, NM, while her mother managed a restaurant on the Santa Fe Plaza. From an early age, Dayan became interested in language, political science, and the arts. After graduating with her Bachelor of Arts, Dayan witnessed the social and political realities for four countries, learning to speak three languages fluently.

Dayan earned a Bachelor of Arts from Colorado College, a Juris Doctor from the University of New Mexico School of Law, and a Master’s in Aviation and Space Law from McGill University. She is the only certified aviation and space attorney in the State of New Mexico. She practices law as a commercial aviation safety and security specialist and has been recognized for her work providing pro bono community legal services.

After graduating from law school, Hochman-Vigil worked as a Public Interest Fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union in Denver. She also worked as a regulatory attorney in Washington, D.C., frequently interacting with the United States Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the National Transportation Safety Board. She also served as Treasurer of the American Bar Association.

Hochman-Vigil returned to New Mexico to practice law at Roybal-Mack & Cordova, PC. She assumed office on January 15, 2019, succeeding Sarah Maestas Barnes. In her time in the NM State Legislature, she has worked on court reform, protections of the confidentiality of crime victims, and increased funding for sexual assault survivor services. She has fought for legislation to increase transparency in political lobbying and to fund more career-technical programs in New Mexico public schools.

In the 2020 Legislative Session, Day co-sponsored, and the Governor signed, HB6 the “Safer Communities Act.” This bi-partisan legislation allows judges to impose stiffer penalties for gun-related crimes and expands the potential resources for community policing. The legislation took a multi-pronged approach to prevent crime while also holding criminals more accountable. Day also sponsored HB21, the “Protect Our Voices Act,” signed by the Governor, to level the playing field for victims of harassment, retaliation or discrimination, preventing employers from forcing nondisclosure agreements as part of the settlement.

Day worked with the Governor to sponsor the “Threats and Acts of Mass Violence” bill to expand the state’s Anti-Terrorism Act to criminalize terroristic threats and conduct. It created penalties for those make threats disrupting public educational or governmental institutions, including those who engage in cyberattacks against public institutions. The legislation originated from a bi-partisan Domestic Terrorism Summit convened by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham in 2019.
