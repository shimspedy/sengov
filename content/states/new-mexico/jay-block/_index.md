Jay Block is a Republican member of the New Mexico State Senate, representing District 12. He assumed office on January 1, 2025, and his current term is set to end on December 31, 2028.

Born in Manchester, New Hampshire, Jay Block has had a distinguished career that spans military service, public administration, and political leadership. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1989 to 2016, retiring with the rank of lieutenant colonel. During his military career, he gained expertise in nuclear weapons and international relations, earning a bachelor's degree in political science from North Dakota State University and a master's degree in international relations from Troy State University.

Before joining the New Mexico State Senate, Block was a member of the Sandoval County Commission, where he served two terms from 2016 to 2024. As a commissioner, he was known for his commitment to public safety, economic development, and fiscal responsibility. He spearheaded initiatives to fund drug and alcohol treatment centers, supported the sheriff's department to reduce crime, and implemented the county's first-ever economic development program, which created hundreds of jobs.

In 2022, Block ran in the Republican primary for the New Mexico gubernatorial election but did not secure the nomination. Despite this setback, he remained a prominent figure in New Mexico politics, advocating for conservative values and policies. His legislative priorities include securing the southern border, reforming education through school choice, eliminating taxes on seniors' social security and veterans' pensions, and protecting the integrity of elections.

Jay Block's tenure in the New Mexico State Senate reflects his dedication to his constituents and his vision for a prosperous and secure New Mexico. He continues to be an influential voice in state politics, championing issues that resonate with his district and beyond.
