Derrick J. Lente is a dedicated public servant and a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives, representing the 65th district. He is a lifelong resident of New Mexico House District 65 and deeply values the people and places in his district.

Born and raised in a traditional Pueblo family, Derrick is a son of two Pueblos in New Mexico - Isleta & Sandia Pueblos. His parents often worked two jobs to raise him and his two older brothers. The values of hard work, dedication, tradition, and family were instilled in him from a young age.

Derrick attended Bernalillo Public Schools from kindergarten through his graduation from Bernalillo High School. He took remedial courses at Central New Mexico Community College, transferred to the University of New Mexico, and earned Bachelor of Arts degrees in Intercultural Communications and in English. 

He went on to study law at the University of New Mexico School of Law, becoming the first male from his Pueblo to earn a Juris Doctorate degree. In addition to a law degree, Derrick was also elected to the Board of Editors for the Tribal Law Journal and earned his certificate specializing in Federal Indian Law.

In 2008, Derrick followed his dream of entrepreneurship when he acquired a company with offices in New Mexico and California. After years of hard work and dedication, Derrick was employing hundreds of New Mexicans and thousands more in other States. Derrick sold the company in 2013 when his company was considered to be one of the largest solely owned Native American companies in the United States.

Derrick has been a professor and visiting speaker in many universities across the United States. He has first-hand experience working on Federal, State, and Tribal issues. Derrick sits on a number of local and national boards that focus on agriculture, economic development, education, and health. He has been identified and awarded the “40 Under Forty” award by both the New Mexico Business Weekly and The National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development.

In 2017, Derrick took his oath of office as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives. He was recognized in 2018 as a “Rising Star” by the Democratic Party of New Mexico and honored with the "Governors Award" by the All Pueblo Governors Council in 2019. He is currently in his second term as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives and has assumed new responsibilities in leadership as Chairman for the House Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources.

Derrick, his wife Kassandra, daughter Jade, and sons Mostin & Easton make their home in Sandia Pueblo where he owns and operates his family farm, Lente Farms.
