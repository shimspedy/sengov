Ron Griggs is an American politician and a Republican member of the New Mexico Senate representing District 34 since December 11, 2012. He was elected to the seat in the November 6, 2012 general election but was appointed by Governor Susana Martinez to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Vernon Asbill days before the term ended.

Griggs attended New Mexico State University Alamogordo and earned his BBA from New Mexico State University.

In the 2012 elections, when District 34 Senator Vernon Asbill retired and left the seat open, Griggs ran in the June 5, 2012 Republican Primary, winning with 1,783 votes (57.5%). He went on to win the November 6, 2012 General election with 9,647 votes (67.7%) against Democratic nominee Ellen Wedum, who had previously run for a New Mexico House of Representatives seat in 2006, 2008, and 2010.

In 2016, Griggs announced he would run for reelection, emphasizing job creation and his success in obtaining capital funding for roads, public infrastructure, and other projects in his district.
