Debbie O'Malley is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the New Mexico State Senate, representing District 13. She assumed office on January 1, 2025, and her current term is set to end on December 31, 2028.

Debbie O'Malley has deep roots in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where her family has been a part of the community for generations. Her great-great-grandfather established a mercantile shop in Old Town in 1850, and her parents were active members of the community. Growing up in Albuquerque, Debbie was inspired by her mother's grassroots efforts to improve the Sawmill neighborhood, which instilled in her a passion for community development and public service.

Debbie's career has been marked by her dedication to improving the lives of her constituents. She founded the Sawmill Community Land Trust in 1998, serving as its executive director until 2003. This innovative redevelopment project gained national recognition for its impact on affordable housing and community revitalization. Debbie also served as a City Councilor for Albuquerque's District 2 from 2003 to 2014, where she played a key role in addressing issues such as public safety, transportation, and economic development.

In 2014, Debbie was elected to the Bernalillo County Commission, representing District 1. During her tenure, she held leadership roles on various boards and commissions, including the Albuquerque Bernalillo Water Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Board. Her work focused on sustainable economic development, affordable housing, and improving public infrastructure.

Debbie's commitment to public service extends beyond her elected positions. She has been actively involved in numerous community organizations, including serving as a board member for the Sawmill Community Land Trust and P B & J Family Services Inc. Her extensive experience in both grassroots activism and government positions has made her a respected leader in her community.

As a State Senator, Debbie O'Malley continues to advocate for policies that support working families, protect the environment, and promote social justice. Her dedication to her constituents and her ability to bring people together to address complex issues have earned her a reputation as a progressive and effective legislator. Debbie lives in the North Valley with her husband, Michael, and they are proud parents and grandparents, deeply connected to the community they serve.
