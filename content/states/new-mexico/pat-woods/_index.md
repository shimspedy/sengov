Election History: In 2012, when District 7 incumbent Republican Senator Harden retired, Woods ran in the three-way June 5, 2012 Republican Primary.

Controversy: In August 2020, Woods attended a rally in Albuquerque that claimed to honor the far-right militia group New Mexico Civil Guard.

This incident highlights the complexities of political affiliations and public perception.
