Heather Berghmans is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the New Mexico State Senate. She represents District 15 and assumed office on January 1, 2025. Her current term is set to end on December 31, 2028.

Born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Heather Berghmans has deep roots in her community. She graduated from Moriarty High School and went on to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and a Master’s in Public Administration from the University of New Mexico. Her academic journey also included an exchange program at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, which broadened her perspective on global political systems.

Before her tenure in the State Senate, Heather built a diverse career that spanned policy analysis, finance consulting, and leadership roles in both the public and private sectors. She served as the Finance Director for the New Mexico House Democratic Campaign Committee, where she played a pivotal role in electing Democratic legislators across the state. Her work in the New Mexico House of Representatives included positions such as Policy Analyst and Director of Special Projects, where she contributed to significant legislative initiatives.

Heather’s commitment to public service is evident in her advocacy for issues such as abortion access, gun violence prevention, climate change, affordable healthcare, and education funding.

Outside of her professional life, Heather is deeply connected to her community. She and her husband, David, have lived in the Altamont neighborhood of District 15 since 2019. Her return to New Mexico in 2018 marked a renewed commitment to her home state, where she continues to work tirelessly for the betterment of her constituents. Heather’s journey from Albuquerque to international ventures and back to her roots exemplifies her passion for service and her vision for a thriving New Mexico.
