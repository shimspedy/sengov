Patrick Boone IV is a member of the Republican Party serving in the New Mexico State Senate. He represents District 27, which includes Chaves, Curry, De Baca, Lea, and Roosevelt Counties. Boone assumed office on January 1, 2025, and his current term is set to end on December 31, 2028.

Patrick Boone IV, often referred to as Pat Boone, is a fifth-generation rancher deeply rooted in the traditions and values of eastern New Mexico. Born and raised in Roosevelt County, Boone grew up immersed in the ranching lifestyle, learning the trade from his father and grandfather. His family has been ranching in the area since 1912, and Boone has carried on this legacy with pride and dedication.

Boone is a devout Christian and an active member of the First Baptist Church in Elida. His faith plays a central role in his life and decision-making, and he is also a supporter of the High Plains Emmaus organization, which focuses on spiritual growth and community service. Boone's commitment to his faith and community has been a guiding force throughout his career.

In addition to his ranching and community involvement, Boone is a strong advocate for issues that matter most to his constituents. He is particularly passionate about addressing water shortages and improving education for the children of New Mexico. Boone believes that access to clean water is a fundamental necessity for survival and that investing in education is crucial for the future of the state.

Boone's personal life is a testament to his values and dedication to family. He has been married to his wife, Cindy, since 1975, and the couple celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in March 2025. Together, they have two children, Sarah and Patrick Henry V (affectionately known as Cinco), and two grandchildren. Boone and Cindy cherish their roles as grandparents and enjoy spending time with their family, whether it's attending their grandson's baseball games or supporting their son's career as a basketball coach.

As a state senator, Boone brings a wealth of experience and a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing rural New Mexico. His leadership is characterized by a commitment to his constituents, a dedication to preserving the values of his community, and a vision for a brighter future for all New Mexicans. Boone's journey from rancher to state senator is a reflection of his servant heart and unwavering belief in the power of public service.
