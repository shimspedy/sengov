Cristina Parajón is an American politician currently serving in the New Mexico House of Representatives. She was appointed by the Bernalillo County Commission to represent House District 25, which covers central I-40 in Bernalillo County, primarily in Albuquerque’s Northeast Heights. Parajón is the youngest female New Mexico legislator in history.

She succeeded Rep. Christine Trujillo and assumed office on August 17, 2023. Her current term ends on December 31, 2024. Parajón is running for re-election to the New Mexico House of Representatives to represent District 25. She is on the ballot in the Democratic primary on June 4, 2024.

Before her appointment to the New Mexico House, Parajón served as the strategy director for the New Mexico Department of Human Services. She also held roles as the deputy incident commander for the emergency operations center, and the gateway administrator for Albuquerque. In her capacity as the gateway administrator, Parajón managed projects addressing homelessness in Albuquerque.

In 2023, following the resignation of Democratic lawmaker Christine Trujillo, the Bernalillo County Commission appointed Parajón to represent House District 25. Selected from a pool of seven candidates with a 4-to-1 vote, Parajón is the first Gen-Z Democrat in the New Mexico State Legislature. She will serve in this capacity until December 31, 2024.

Born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Parajón pursued her undergraduate studies at Harvard University, receiving a full scholarship. As a Schwarzman Scholar, she later obtained a master's degree from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, focusing on reproductive health and gender inequalities in Nicaragua. Parajón also worked in financial management consulting prior to entering public service.

Parajón graduated from Nicaraguan Christian Academy International in 2014. Parajón earned a bachelor's degree in sociology and government from Harvard University in 2018 and a master's degree in management sciences from Schwarzman College in 2019. Her career experience includes working as the director of strategy of the New Mexico Department of Human Services, a gateway administrator with the City of Albuquerque, and a consultant with Oliver Wyman.
