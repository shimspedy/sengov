Kathleen M. Cates is a dedicated public servant and the Democratic representative for New Mexico District 44. She has been a resident of the Albuquerque-Corrales-Rio Rancho area for the past 25 years, most of which she has spent in District 44. Her intimate knowledge of the district comes from her experiences as a homeowner, a small-business owner, an executive for nonprofit corporations, a civic leader, and as a parent.

Both of her children attended and graduated from Rio Rancho Public Schools, and raising them launched her participation in many local events and activities. This involvement grounded her understanding of the community’s goals and concerns. She firmly believes that community involvement promotes community achievement.

Prior to entering politics, Cates worked for a jewelry company, served as an e-commerce manager for Goodwill Industries of New Mexico, and was the CEO of a non-profit. Since 2021, Cates has also worked as a realtor. She was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives in November 2022.

Her career as the CEO of two non-profits and her volunteer work as a member of the New Mexico Developmental Disabilities Council have expanded her knowledge of the community’s achievements and issues. This experience inspired her to advocate for underserved and marginalized people, such as women diagnosed with mental health and substance abuse problems; disabled people seeking job opportunities; and children with developmental disorders or who are considered “at-risk.”

Cates' active participation in the Rio Rancho Sunrise Rotary showed her that community involvement promotes community achievement. A fundamental belief of hers is that our government must always seek input from affected groups about services that are intended for them. She believes that government must respond to all the stakeholders, not just the squeaky wheels.

Solving problems usually required negotiating among people with very different objectives and philosophies. She knows just how important it is to find shared values. Finding shared values is more important than ever if we are to preserve and strengthen our community and our democracy.

Now, she is seeking to advocate for you and all of District 44. As your District 44 Representative, she will listen to your concerns and make sure they are heard in the Round House.
