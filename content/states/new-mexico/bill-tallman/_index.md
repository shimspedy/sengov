Bill Tallman serves as a State Senator in District 18, where he has fought for New Mexico's hard-working families. He's always voted to protect those with preexisting conditions and supported efforts to make health care more affordable and accessible.

Bill knows that we must invest in our public education system, support our educators, and give our children every opportunity possible to succeed. He has sponsored legislation to secure safe retirement saving opportunities for New Mexico’s seniors, better schools and parks for our children, and more crime-fighting technologies for our police. He has also worked for improved access for New Mexicans who want to return to college to increase their education and get better jobs.

Bill has served as Senator for District 18 since 2016. The District covers Albuquerque’s NE Heights, with Wyoming Blvd on the west; Constitution on the south; Academy on the north; and Tramway on the east. As State Senator, he was designated a “Super Hero” by the NM AARP. During the 2018 Legislative Session, Bill received a “Focused and Finished Award” from the NM Association of Commerce and Industry for co-sponsoring HB193, the Early Childhood Care Accountability Act. Lt. Governor Howie Morales recognized Bill for sponsoring legislation to fund after-school programs. He received a 100% score from Common Cause NM in 2017 for his votes on open, honest, and accountable government, as well as a 100% score from the League of Conservation Voters.

Bill most recently served as Deputy City Manager of Santa Fe, NM, where he worked with 1,500 employees and a budget of $250 million. He created a performance budgeting program and supervised the information technology, fleet, building maintenance, risk management, emergency management, senior services, and recreation. Bill has over 35 years of experience as a City Manager for several cities across the United States, where he managed thousands of employees, implemented cost-saving measures, built infrastructure investments, and created new jobs. His major emphasis has been in personnel, labor relations, financial management, productivity improvement, budgeting, and economic development. He was President-Elect of the Connecticut Town & City Management Association.

Bill taught an undergraduate course in public administration and human resources at Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois. He has published articles in PM Magazine. Bill has been active in the Municipal Leagues of Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Connecticut. He is a past member of the Corporation for Regional Development, the Quad City Civic Center Authority, the Quad City Development Group, and the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments.

Bill holds an MA in Public Administration from the University of Cincinnati and a BA in Political Science from Syracuse University.
