In 1996 Jeff became an aide to then-U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson in Washington D.C., where he worked on international affairs, education and urban issues. After a few years in Washington, Jeff entered the private sector. He also continued to champion national issues as the founder, organizer and moderator of the Fall Conference on Reducing the National Debt in Washington, D.C. In 1998, Jeff returned to public service by working for Congressman Tom Udall’s first successful campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives.

In 2001, Jeff was tapped by U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman to serve as his Field Representative for southwest New Mexico.
