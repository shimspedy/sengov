Elected in 2020, Crystal Diamond Brantley represents the Southern New Mexico Senate District 35, which includes most of the borderlands of NM & Mexico. She is the first female and the first republican ever elected to the seat. She set a legislative campaign fundraising record during her 2020 election and continues to prove herself as a impressive fundraiser of mostly small dollar, grassroots support. She serves on the powerful Senate Finance Committee, an appointment rarely afforded to newcomers. Nationally, Crystal is the first New Mexico senator selected to serve on the Republican State Leadership Committee to assist campaign efforts of conservative candidates across America.

One of us.

Raised in Las Cruces, Crystal was active in youth leadership organizations including Future Farmers of America (FFA) and 4-H before attending New Mexico State University where she obtained her degree in Agricultural Economics and Agriculture Business.

Crystal has served the conservation and natural resource needs of New Mexico as both elected official and former director of Sierra Soil & Water Conservation District. Crystal recognizes ranchers and farmers to be the true guardians of our land, water, livestock & wildlife. She continues to advocate for responsible, multi-use of our lands and natural resources, and promoting conservation over preservation.



Community Minded.
Crystal served as an elected member of the Truth or Consequences School Board. She is a long time member of Chamiza Cowbelles and past president of Sierra County Farm & Livestock Bureau. A proud NMSU Aggie, Crystal continues to stay connected to her alma mater, formerly serving as president of the NMSU College of Agriculture Alumni Council. Her leadership roles in agriculture networks across the state include serving on the NM Cattle Growers Association Board of Directors and NM Farm & Livestock Board of Directors. 


Campaign Promises.
Making good on campaign promises to bridge the rural urban divide, Crystal successfully championed the creation of a Rural Ombudsman position which received unanimous support from legislators and went on to be signed by the Governor. She was honored as the 2022 Legislator of the Year by New Mexico District Attorneys for her work to support law enforcement and strengthen criminal punishments. In 2023 she was awarded Legislator of the Year by New Mexico Home & Hospice Providers for her work to champion small business and contract providers. Nationally, Crystal is the first New Mexico senator selected to serve on the National Republican State Leadership Committee to assist campaign efforts of conservative candidates across America.


Family First.

Crystal raised her young children, Cayden & Reece, on the family owned ranch at Beaverhead which expands across Sierra & Catron County. She pressed upon her daughters, who are the 4th generation of ranchers, the importance of being responsible land stewards, self-reliance, and respect for both your neighbors and the environment. She and her daughters are avid hunters and outdoor enthusiasts with rooted-western, rural New Mexico values. 

Crystal resides in Elephant Butte where her family enjoys spending time on the states largest lake. She is married to Mr. Tom Brantley, a farmer & rancher working lands that have been in his family for over 130 years.  Together, they are raising 5 teenage daughters and look forward to quiet weekend getaways at their remote forest cabin. Alone.
