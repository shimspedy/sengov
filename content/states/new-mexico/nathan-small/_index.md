Nathan P. Small is an American politician serving as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives from the 36th district. He is a third-generation New Mexican from a family of teachers and ranchers. His mother, the daughter of a rancher, was an educator at a New Mexico state prison and at several community colleges. Nathan grew up in El Cerro Mission in a single-wide trailer with a communal well.

Small earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and philosophy from the College of Wooster. He served two terms as Las Cruces City Councilor and previously chaired the City of Las Cruces Economic Development Committee. He was elected to the New Mexico House for District 36 in 2016. He filed for reelection in 2018, winning with 59.9% of the general election vote.

His wife, Xochitl Torres Small, was formerly the United States representative for New Mexico's 2nd congressional district from 2019 to 2021, and is currently the United States Deputy Secretary of Agriculture.

Nathan Small understands hard work. He is a lifelong outdoorsman with a passion for public service. Elected to the Las Cruces City Council in 2007, Nathan led the effort to create the City of Las Cruces Sustainability Officer and to focus on economic development and care for existing neighborhoods.

Since 2016, Nathan has served Las Cruces in the State Legislature. Nathan has helped to transform our state through groundbreaking policies like the Energy Transition Act, the Produced Water Act, Graduate Medical Expansion grants, and the Healthy Soils Act. A conservationist, he helped to lead the effort to conserve Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks.

Nathan works hard for families who work hard. He serves as the Vice-Chair of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee and serves as a member of the House Agriculture, Acequias, and Water Resources Committee and the Rural Economic Opportunities Task Force. As Vice-Chair of House Appropriations, Nathan led the fight to reduce the burden of inflation by cutting the gross receipts tax, eliminating the tax on Social Security income, passing $500 to $1,000 rebates to help working families with more relief to come, and expanding the working families and child tax credits, and bringing millions of dollars to southern New Mexico for critical infrastructure needs.

He has also put New Mexicoâ€™s children and families first by investing an additional $500 million in the historic moonshot for public education, raising teacher pay to a minimum of $50,000 per year, and making college and vocational school free for all New Mexicans who work hard. Nathan helped to protect those with pre-existing health conditions from losing insurance coverage and supported groundbreaking legislation to lower premiums for individuals and small businesses, which will go into effect this January.
