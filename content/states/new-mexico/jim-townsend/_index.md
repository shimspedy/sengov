James G. Townsend, also known as Jim Townsend, is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives, where he represents the 54th district. 

Born and raised in Carlsbad, New Mexico, Townsend has been a lifelong resident of the state. He attended New Mexico State University in Carlsbad, further cementing his ties to the region.

Before entering politics, Townsend had a successful career in the energy sector. He held several positions in various companies including Southern Union Co., Southern Union Gas Company, Southern Union Refining Company, Navajo Refining Company, Holly Energy Partners, and UNEV Pipeline Company. His experience in this sector has given him a unique perspective on energy issues, which he has brought to his role in the House of Representatives.

Townsend was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives in 2016. Since then, he has been a strong voice for his constituents, advocating for policies that support the energy sector and the economy of New Mexico. He became the Minority Leader at the start of the 2019 legislative session, a position he held until 2023.

As a legislator, Townsend has been known for his conservative views. He is an opponent of abortion and voted against House Bill 51, which attempted to repeal an old New Mexico law that makes it a crime to perform an abortion. In 2022, he played a key role in obstructing the New Mexico legislature from passing voting reform legislation. The legislation would have allowed people to sign up once to receive absentee ballots in future elections, restored the voting rights of felons, and required every county to provide a minimum of two ballot drop boxes.

In March 2024, following the resignation of his successor T. Ryan Lane, Townsend assumed the position of acting minority leader. He served in this role until April 2024, when he was succeeded by Rod Montoya.

Currently, Townsend is running for election to the New Mexico State Senate to represent District 34. He is on the ballot in the Republican primary, which will be held on June 4, 2024.

Throughout his career, Townsend has shown a commitment to serving his constituents and the people of New Mexico. His leadership in the House of Representatives and his extensive experience in the energy sector make him a key figure in New Mexico politics.
