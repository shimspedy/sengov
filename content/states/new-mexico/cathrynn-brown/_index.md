Cathrynn Brown is a dedicated and influential figure in the New Mexico House of Representatives, representing District 55. She has been an active and positive influence in her community, leading by example in every aspect of her life. 

Cathrynn is a graduate of Reed College and the University of Idaho College of Law, where she served as editor-in-chief of Law Review. After her graduation, she practiced law in Carlsbad, New Mexico, before retiring recently. 

For the past 14 years, Cathrynn has been representing District 55, which consists of portions of Eddy and Lea Counties. She is a member of the powerful Appropriations and Finance Committee and is the ranking member of the Transportation, Public Works, and Capital Improvements Committee. She also served eight years on the House Judiciary Committee. 

In addition to her committee work, Cathrynn chaired two committees of the New Mexico Legislature from 2015 to 2016. She is a long-time, active member of the National Council of State Legislatures’ working group on nuclear energy issues. 

Throughout her career, Cathrynn has sponsored more than 200 bills, sponsored annual capital outlay requests, and worked tirelessly to send millions of dollars back to her district. Last year, her HB-319 passed both chambers of the legislature and was signed by Governor Martinez. This bill granted the Carlsbad Brine Well Remediation Authority the right to negotiate and execute contracts related to the project and made clear how the state appropriations would be spent, and by what contractors.

Cathrynn has been lauded by her peers with awards, such as the ‘Spirit of Bipartisanship’ award by New Mexico First and the ‘Top Legislator’ award by the Rio Grande Foundation. She has also worked on the ground as Chairwoman of the Eddy County Republican Party, and a board member of Carlsbad Right to Life. 

Cathrynn has one of the highest American Conservative Union ratings among her colleagues, with 73% in 2018, and 88% in 2017, with a lifetime average of 77%. Her open, honest, and friendly personality, matched by her dedicated leadership and organizational skills, make her a beloved figure in her community. She is always ready to listen and act on behalf of her constituents.
