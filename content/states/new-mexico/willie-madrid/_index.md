Willie Madrid is an American politician and educator, currently serving as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives from the 53rd district, which includes Doña Ana, New Mexico. He is honored to represent District 53 in the New Mexico House and fight for his community's priorities.

Born and raised in Chaparral, New Mexico, Willie has lived there for 49 years. His family was among the first to migrate to the community and was only the third Hispanic family. Willie grew up in a close-knit, bilingual family. He learned early on that he had a duty to help others. Today he has four beautiful adult children – Rhian, Michael, Alyssa, and Briana – and lives in Chaparral.

Before entering politics, Willie worked as an instructional assistant and football coach in the Gadsden Independent Schools. He has been an instructional assistant for the Gadsden Independent Public School District for 13 years, teaching Alternative Skills classes. He teaches at the same school that he once attended. Willie has helped thousands of students realize their potential. He has seen firsthand that education transforms lives.

Outside the classroom, Willie has spent his evenings and weekends on the football field. Coach Madrid instills a love for the game and a love for the team in his players. He has coached and managed local teams for 27 years, from Chaparral Middle School Knights to the Chaparral High School Lobos. He’s proud of his teams’ 7 championships.

Willie has been the voice for the voiceless. He’s fighting for you. “Our people have been ignored and disconnected for too long. Together we will change that,” he says. Throughout his decades of coaching and teaching, Willie has always been connected to the people. They’ve always been able to talk to him. Day or night. At school or on the street. He has the strength to take on their burdens and fight to make them right. Our community is being heard in the state House and Willie will never stop making sure your concerns and your priorities are listened to. "You have to remember who you serve." Willie’s father was an inspiration for him throughout his life. He taught Willie the importance of family. Treat everyone the same, his father said. See no color. Work for the people. You don’t need big words, just the words that get things done. Willie holds onto these lessons as he fights for the people of District 53.
