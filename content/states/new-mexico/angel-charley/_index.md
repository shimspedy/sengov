Angel Charley is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the New Mexico State Senate. She represents District 30 and assumed office on January 1, 2025. Her current term is set to end on December 31, 2028.

Angel Charley has dedicated her career to advocating for the safety and well-being of women and children, particularly within Native communities. She grew up in the village of Old Laguna, deeply connected to her cultural roots and the aspirations of her community. Her educational journey began at Laguna High School, and she later earned an associate degree in Liberal Arts from the University of Hawaii.

Before her tenure in the New Mexico State Senate, Angel served as the Executive Director of the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women, where she worked tirelessly to amplify the voices of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Her leadership extended to IllumiNative, a national organization focused on uplifting the voices and representation of Native people across the country.

Angel's community involvement is extensive and impactful. She has served on the New Mexico State Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives Task Force, as Secretary for the Laguna Federation of Democratic Women, and as a board member for organizations such as the Alliance of Tribal Coalitions to End Violence and the Albuquerque Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners Collaborative. Her advocacy has been recognized by the New Mexico Senate for her work on behalf of murdered and missing Indigenous women.

In addition to her professional and community roles, Angel is a devoted mother and resides in the Pueblo of Acoma with her husband, Keegan King, and their three children. Her passion for improving the lives of working families and addressing the challenges faced by rural and Native communities continues to drive her work in the New Mexico State Senate.
