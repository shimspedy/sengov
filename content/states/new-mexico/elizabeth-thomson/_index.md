Elizabeth 'Liz' L. Thomson is an American politician and a Democratic member of the New Mexico House of Representatives representing District 24. She was born in 1960 or 1961, making her around 62-63 years old.

Thomson graduated from the University of New Mexico with a B.S. degree in physical therapy. Her career has been spent as a pediatric physical therapist. In addition to her clinical work, she has served on the board of directors of the New Mexico chapter of the American Physical Therapy Association.

In 2012, Thomson ran for the New Mexico House of Representatives district 24 seat held by Republican representative Conrad James, beating the incumbent by less than 300 votes. She has announced her intention to seek reelection in 2014, in what was likely a replay of the 2012 race against James.

Thomson introduced legislation to establish the New Mexico Fall Prevention Task Force. The goal of the task force is to prevent older adult falls. In New Mexico, falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits among older adults. The program includes an awareness campaign about modifiable fall risk factors as well as an increase in availability of fall prevention classes around the state. It was enacted by the legislature and signed into law in 2014.

Thomson has been a strong opponent of horse slaughter. In the legislature, Thomson sponsored House Bill 121 which would have banned the use of horses as a food source, and House Bill 120 which would have required horses be husbanded according to state regulations for livestock. Neither measure passed out of committee. Thomson also voted for a bill that would prohibit the use of performance-enhancing drugs by racehorses.

Thomson is married and has two children. She is known for her commitment to public health and animal welfare. Her personal life was deeply affected when her son was diagnosed with autism, and the services he required were not available in Albuquerque. This inspired her to make a promise to herself, “I’m going to be the voice for people who feel like they don’t have a voice in our Capitol.”

Thomson assumed office in 2017. Her current term ends on December 31, 2024. She is running for re-election to the New Mexico House of Representatives to represent District 24. She is on the ballot in the Democratic primary on June 4, 2024.
