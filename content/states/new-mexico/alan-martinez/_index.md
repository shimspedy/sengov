Alan T. Martinez is a committed Christian and an American politician serving as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives for the 23rd district. He was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 1, 2023.

Martinez was born in Española, New Mexico. He graduated from Española Valley High School in 1982 and attended Cochise Junior College Cochise College. Martinez earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in education and religion from Southern Arizona Bible College in 1986.

Before starting his political career, Martinez was involved in small business in Espanola and Albuquerque. He then started his career with the New Mexico Department of Veteran Services (NMDVS), where he served Veterans and their families for over 25 years. He started with NMDVS as a file clerk in 1993 and ended his career as the Deputy Secretary and Legislative Director in December 2018.

His passion for serving others is why Alan now wants to serve the people of his community as a representative for the New Mexico House of Representatives District 23. This district covers parts of the Town of Bernalillo west of the Rio Grande as well as northern Rio Rancho. Alan wants to make sure that our state government is responsive to the needs of the citizens of this district. His 25 years of experience with state government gives him better insight on navigating the sometimes-complicated bureaucracies of state and local government agencies.

He understands that the role of a state representative is an everyday responsibility, not only during the legislative session or leading up to an election. He is ready to serve his constituents all year long. Alan currently serves as the vice-president of his local homeowner's association, as well as a local board member of the United States Selective Service System for the State of New Mexico.

Alan is married to the love of his life, Allison, and together they enjoy spending time with their 6 kids and 4 grandkids.
