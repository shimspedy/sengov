Andrea Rowley Reeb is an American attorney and politician serving as a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives for the 64th district. She was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 1, 2023.

Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Reeb was raised in Clovis, New Mexico. After graduating from Clovis High School in 1989, she pursued higher education at Creighton University, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Juris Doctor from the Creighton University School of Law.

Before her political career, Reeb gained extensive experience in the legal field. She served as an assistant district attorney for the 9th Judicial District in New Mexico. Her roles also included senior trial prosecutor, chief deputy attorney, and district attorney in Clovis. In addition to her legal career, she also worked as an adjunct professor for Clovis Community College.

In 2014, Reeb was elected district attorney for New Mexico's Ninth Judicial District and served until March 2022. She was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives in November 2022 and assumed office on January 1, 2023. 

Reeb was appointed in August 2022 as a special prosecutor by Santa Fe County's district attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies to assist in the investigation and prosecution of the shooting incident on the set of the film Rust. However, in February 2023, prosecutors reduced the charges after Baldwin's attorneys successfully argued that prosecutors had charged him under a law which hadn't existed at the time the shooting occurred. 

Reeb's appointment was challenged by Baldwin's lawyers, and she recused herself two weeks before a judge was expected to rule on whether or not she should be disqualified. On April 21, 2023, charges against Baldwin were dropped by prosecutors who had been appointed to replace Reeb.

As a representative, Reeb is committed to serving her constituents in the 64th district. She is running for re-election to the New Mexico House of Representatives to represent District 64, with the Republican primary scheduled for June 4, 2024.
