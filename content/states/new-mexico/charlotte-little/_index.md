Charlotte Little is a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives, representing District 68. She assumed office on January 1, 2023, and her current term ends on December 31, 2024. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

Charlotte Little was born and raised in San Felipe Pueblo, surrounded by her parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. Her father began his working career as a machinist and welder and later graduated with a master’s degree in counseling psychology in his 40s. Her mother was trained and worked as a practical nurse. When they began a family, she became a homemaker and, throughout their childhood, a surrogate mom to their cousins and friends.

Charlotte Little is married to Joseph Little, an attorney and former judge. They have been married for over 28 years and have a blended family with three grown children and grandchildren.

For fifteen years, Charlotte Little has owned her own small business; served as a Tribal Administrator; and worked as an Administrative Officer for the United States Department of Health and Human Services. She has served New Mexicans through her work as Vice-Chair of New Mexico Voices for Children, President of Emerge New Mexico, and Chair of the San Felipe Pueblo Health Board.

Charlotte Little's work as a tribal administrator taught her how to listen to her community’s needs. Her constituents chose her for the House, where she’s working to create thousands of new jobs in clean industries, lower the cost of living for families across the state, and ensure that all New Mexicans have access to affordable health care.

Charlotte Little narrowly won the election in the 2022 house election against Republican Robert Moss, who she beat by 35 votes following a recount. She is running for re-election to the New Mexico House of Representatives to represent District 68. She is on the ballot in the Democratic primary on June 4, 2024.
