Joseph Louis Sanchez is an American politician and a proud 12th generation Northern New Mexican from Alcalde. He represents the 40th district in the New Mexico House of Representatives since January 1, 2023 and previously from January 17, 2019 to January 19, 2021. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Sanchez's work ethic was instilled at a young age. He grew up helping his father with his contracting business, raising cattle, cleaning the acequia every spring, and growing hay and alfalfa. Those childhood years are serving him well today.

He earned his MS and BS in Engineering from the University of New Mexico and his MBA from New Mexico State University. His career experience includes working as an electrical engineer and engineering manager with Los Alamos National Laboratory and as the general manager and CEO of the Jemez Mountains Electric Cooperative.

Sanchez was blessed to be brought up in a family that appreciates New Mexican music. To this day, he plays the saxophone in his family band Los Blue Ventures.

In 2018, he was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives, District 40. As Representative, he has introduced dozens of bills advocating for Northern New Mexico, fought for millions in critical funding and projects, and served as Vice-Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.

In Santa Fe, he is proud to bring a strong work ethic instilled as a child and use his legislative experience to fight for our land, water, and people. He is always fighting to be a voice for rural New Mexico.

In the legislature, Sanchez is fighting for commonsense policies that support the oil and gas industry while working with them on a reasonable transition to renewables, and promote New Mexico as a hydrogen hub. He is supporting the rollout of rural Broadband to expand access throughout the entire state to help attract the high-tech jobs of the future. He is strengthening the 80-year relationship with the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He is fighting for our land grants and land grant communities, and advocating for the priories of our Native American communities.

Sanchez is running for re-election to the New Mexico House of Representatives to represent District 40. He is on the ballot in the Democratic primary on June 4, 2024.
