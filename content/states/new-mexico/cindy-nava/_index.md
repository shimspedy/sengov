Cindy Nava is a Democratic Party member serving in the New Mexico State Senate, representing District 9. She assumed office on January 1, 2025, and her current term is set to end on December 31, 2028.

Cindy Nava's journey to public service is a testament to her resilience and dedication. Born in Mexico, she immigrated to the United States with her family as a child. Growing up in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico, she faced the challenges of being an immigrant while striving to achieve her dreams. Nava is a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allowed her to pursue her education and career aspirations. She earned an associate degree in education from Santa Fe Community College, followed by a Bachelor of Arts in political science and a Master of Science in educational leadership and policy from the University of New Mexico.

Before entering the political arena, Nava gained extensive experience in public service and policy-making. She worked as an aide in the New Mexico Legislature and served in the office of then-Congressman Ben Ray Luj√°n. Her commitment to education reform and community engagement led her to roles such as the executive director of Transform Education New Mexico and the chief administrative officer of the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute. From 2022 to 2024, she served as a senior policy advisor in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, becoming one of the first DACA recipients to receive a presidential appointment.

In 2024, Cindy Nava returned to New Mexico to launch her campaign for the State Senate. She won the Democratic primary and subsequently defeated her Republican opponent in the general election. As a state senator, Nava is committed to advancing education reform, affordable housing, and healthcare access for all residents of District 9. Her leadership reflects her deep understanding of the challenges faced by her constituents and her unwavering dedication to creating opportunities for all New Mexicans.

Cindy Nava resides in Bernalillo, New Mexico, with her husband, Hector, and their two dogs, Pebbles and Khloe. Her story continues to inspire many as she works tirelessly to ensure that every resident of her district can achieve their own version of the New Mexican dream.
