Gabriel Ramos is a Republican member of the New Mexico State Senate, representing District 28. He assumed office on January 1, 2025, and his current term is set to end on December 31, 2028.

Gabriel Ramos has had a diverse career in public service and business. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business and public administration from Western New Mexico University. His journey in public service began at a young age when he joined the New Mexico Army National Guard at 17, which instilled in him a strong sense of duty and service. After completing his service, Ramos ventured into the business world, establishing and operating several small businesses in his community.

Ramos's political career is marked by his dedication to his constituents and his ability to address local issues effectively. He served as the Grant County Clerk at the age of 25, showcasing his leadership skills early on. He later held positions on the Town Council, where he contributed to essential infrastructure projects, and on the Cobre School Board. His commitment to his community extended to his role as a Grant County Commissioner, a position he held for eight years.

In 2019, Ramos was appointed to the New Mexico State Senate to fill a vacancy. During his initial tenure, he served on various committees, including the Indian, Rural & Cultural Affairs Committee and the Senate Education Committee. Although he faced challenges and criticism for some of his votes, Ramos remained focused on his goals and priorities.

After a brief hiatus from the Senate, Ramos returned to politics and successfully ran for his former seat in 2024 as a Republican. His victory marked a significant moment in his career, as he continues to represent District 28, which includes areas such as Socorro, Glenwood, and Silver City. Ramos's dedication to his community and his ability to navigate complex political landscapes have solidified his reputation as a committed public servant.
