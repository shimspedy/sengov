Harold Pope Jr. is an American politician and retired United States Air Force officer. He assumed office as a New Mexico State Senator from the 23rd district on January 19, 2021, after defeating incumbent Republican Sander Rue in the 2020 election.

**Early Life and Education:**
Pope was born and raised in Pueblo, Colorado. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he worked as a dental technician. Later, he transitioned to the Air Force Reserve and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry from the University of New Mexico. Following graduation, he was commissioned through the Air Force ROTC program and served as a Chemist & Acquisitions Officer. Pope furthered his education by obtaining a Master of Science in pharmaceutical chemistry from the University of Florida and a Master of Arts in operational leadership from the Air Command and Staff College [^1^][1].

**Career:**
During his military career, Pope specialized in satellite programs, weapon systems, and nuclear deterrence. After retiring from the Air Force, he became a facilities transition advisor in the administration of Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller. In the November general election, Pope defeated incumbent Republican Sander Rue, making him the first African-American member of the New Mexico Senate [^2^][2].

Pope's dedication to public service and his historic achievement as the first Black state senator in New Mexico highlight his commitment to representing the people of Bernalillo County.
