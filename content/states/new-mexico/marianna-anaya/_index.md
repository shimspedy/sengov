Marianna Anaya is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the New Mexico House of Representatives. She represents District 18 and assumed office on January 1, 2025. Her current term is set to end on December 31, 2026.

Born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Marianna Anaya grew up in the North Valley, surrounded by her family, including her mother, grandmother, and eight aunts. She was the first in her family to attend college, graduating from Valley High School before pursuing higher education at the University of Texas at Austin. There, she began her journey into policy work at the Texas Center for Education Policy. Her passion for community organizing and policy advocacy was ignited during the summer of Senator Wendy Davis's filibuster against a restrictive Texas abortion ban.

Marianna's academic pursuits continued at UCLA, where she studied Race and Ethnic Studies in Education. However, her desire to actively participate in policy-making led her back to New Mexico. She immersed herself in community work, serving as a congressional field representative and collaborating with union educators. Her advocacy efforts have been instrumental in repealing New Mexico's 1969 abortion ban, protecting access to abortion and gender-affirming care, passing the New Mexico Voting Rights Act, and leading the coalition to establish Paid Family and Medical Leave.

In addition to her legislative work, Marianna owns a small business specializing in communications, media relations, and policy advocacy. Her lived experiences as a queer woman of color and her family's struggles with issues like substance abuse, homelessness, and incarceration have deeply informed her commitment to economic stability, healthcare access, and quality education for all.

Outside of her professional life, Marianna enjoys exploring nature with her three dogs, Frida, Mila, and Shadow. Whether hiking, camping, or renovating her home, she finds joy in the outdoors and her local community. A self-proclaimed foodie, she frequents local restaurants and coffee shops in her district, further connecting with the people she represents. Her dedication to her constituents and her personal connection to the challenges they face make her a passionate and effective advocate for District 18.
