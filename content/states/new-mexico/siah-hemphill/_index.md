Siah has been an educator for 25 years, working as a teacher, a school psychologist and as a director of special education. Siah was inspired to pursue a career in education and special education by her son Nicholas, who was born with a rare genetic syndrome and has multiple disabilities.

Siah attended Bayard Elementary. She and her friends would hang out at the baseball field in the summer and her family would go hiking in the mountains around Hanover. Siah attended Cobre and Silver High School, and then graduated from Western New Mexico University, where both of her parents went. Siah met her husband at the Buffalo Bar in downtown Silver City. 

They have four wonderful children and have been the proud owners of three successful small businesses, including the Gila Hike and Bike in Silver City.

Siah works in the Cobre Consolidated School District and Aldo Leopold Charter School District. She also trains teachers on trauma informed teaching practices. When she’s not working with teachers you can find Siah spending time with her family, hiking, and enjoying the outdoors.
