Patty Lundstrom was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives 2000 in District 5 and redistricted into the current District 9 in 2003. Raised in a working-class family, with her father employed as a uranium miner and her mother worked administration for a local doctor, Patty’s upbringing instilled in her a strong work ethic and a commitment to serving her community.


After graduating from Grants High School, Patty pursued higher education at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, earning two undergraduate degrees before obtaining a master's degree in public administration.


Patty’s career spans over two decades of service to the people of New Mexico. For 25 years, she served as the Executive Director of the Northwest New Mexico Council of Governments, focusing on economic development, community development and regional planning. During her tenure, she spearheaded the Navajo Gallup Water Supply project, a billion-dollar endeavor aimed at providing essential water resources to local Navajo Chapters and Gallup.


In her current role, Patty continues to make significant contributions to economic development, notably through her efforts in establishing the Greater Gallup Industrial Workforce Program. Her dedication to improving economic opportunities for her constituents underscores her commitment to their prosperity.


Patty served on the House Appropriations and Finance Committee for 20 years, and served as chair for six years—the first woman to hold this prestigious position. Patty has demonstrated her commitment to fiscal responsibility, as she always balanced the state budget as chair. Although no longer a current member of the budget committee, her expertise is recognized nationally, as she continues to be invited to serve on the National Conference of State Legislatures budget and finance groups.


Currently, Patty serves on the Commerce and Transportation committees, where she advocates for policies that promote economic growth and infrastructure development throughout the state. Her primary focus remains on enhancing education, bolstering healthcare services, and improving infrastructure statewide.


Patty has spearheaded significant reforms in transportation funding distribution, resulting in the creation of the Local Government Road Fund. This legislative achievement enables municipalities, counties, and tribal entities to access essential funds for vital infrastructure projects. Through her advocacy, Patty has facilitated the allocation of millions of dollars to communities within her district. These funds have been instrumental in financing critical initiatives such as road improvements, community centers, senior centers (including those in Gallup and Twin Lakes), utility extensions, bathroom renovations, and park enhancements.
