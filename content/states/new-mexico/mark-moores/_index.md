Mark David Moores (born April 28, 1970) is an American businessman and politician serving as a member of the New Mexico Senate for the 21st district. Elected in November 2012, he took office on January 15, 2013. Moores was born and raised in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. His mother, who is of Hispano descent, is originally from Española, New Mexico, and Moores spent summers and holidays in northern New Mexico.

After graduating from Walt Whitman High School, Moores moved to New Mexico to attend the University of New Mexico, where he was awarded a scholarship to play football for the Lobos. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and later an MBA from the Anderson School of Management.

Moores has a diverse professional background. He served as the chief of staff for Lieutenant Governor Walter Dwight Bradley and worked as a field representative for Congressman Steven Schiff. From 2006 to 2017, Moores was the executive director of the New Mexico Dental Association, where he managed free dental clinics across the state.

In 2012, Moores ran in the three-way Republican primary for the 21st district of the New Mexico Senate, winning with 50% of the vote. He went on to win the general election against incumbent Democratic senator Lisa Curtis. In subsequent elections, he secured re-election to the Senate.

Moores also sought the Republican nomination for the 2021 New Mexico's 1st congressional district special election. Although he faced strong competition, he ultimately lost to Democrat Melanie Stansbury in the special election.

Outside of politics, Moores enjoys spending time with his wife, Lisa Moores, and their four children and three grandchildren.
