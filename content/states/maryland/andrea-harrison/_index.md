Andrea Fletcher Harrison, also known as Andrea Carleen Fletcher, is an American politician. She was born on September 20, 1963, in Washington, D.C., to James C. Fletcher. She currently serves in the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 24 in Prince George's County, Maryland.

Education:
Andrea received an Associate in Arts in micro computer systems from Prince George's Community College in 1992. She then received a Bachelor of Arts degree in public policy from Bowie State University in 2002.

Career:
Before getting into politics in 2002, Harrison was active with the Ardmore Springdale Civic Association, serving as its president, vice president, and secretary from 1994 to 2007. After the death of Gwendolyn T. Britt on January 12, 2008, Prince George's County councilmember David C. Harrington was appointed to serve the rest of Britt's term in the Maryland Senate. A special election was held to fill the rest of Harrington's term on the County Council. Harrison won the Democratic primary to fill the seat on April 2, 2008, edging out Edmonston mayor Adam Ortiz by 137 votes. She was sworn in on May 19, 2008, and represented district 5 until December 3, 2019. She was the first woman to represent the seat, which was previously held by her father. In 2012, she was elected to chair the county council.

In 2016, Harrison campaigned in support of a referendum to expand the county council, which led to speculation as to whether she would seek re-election to the council. She declined running for either of the two at-large positions on the council, instead announcing her candidacy for the Maryland House of Delegates in district 24 on December 14, 2017. During the primary, she was endorsed by U.S. Representative Anthony Brown. She won the Democratic primary, coming in third place in a field of 11 candidates with 14.5 percent of the vote.

Legislature:
Harrison was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019. She is a member of the Economic Matters Committee and serves as the Deputy Majority Whip.

Personal Life:
Andrea Harrison is a mother of three and resides in Springdale, Maryland, U.S.
