Her journey to this esteemed position is a testament to her resilience, hard work, and unwavering commitment to public service.

Woorman's early life was marked by a significant transition when she and her family immigrated to Montgomery County, Maryland, when she was just nine years old. This move set the stage for her future in American politics. She graduated from Northwest High School in 2009 and went on to attend Montgomery College, where she earned an associate's degree in international business in 2012. Her academic journey continued at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in government and politics in 2015. During her college years, Woorman became a U.S. citizen, further solidifying her commitment to her adopted country.

Woorman's political career began shortly after her graduation. She worked for the Maryland General Assembly for seven years, holding various positions, including chief of staff and legislative director for several members from 2016 to 2021. Her dedication and expertise in legislative matters earned her the role of campaign manager for the 21st district incumbents in 2018. Additionally, she served as the executive vice president of Maryland Young Democrats from 2023 to 2024 and chaired the board of directors for Pro-Choice Maryland from 2022 to 2024.

In 2020, Woorman ran for delegate to the Democratic National Convention, initially pledging her support to Pete Buttigieg in the primary.

Her involvement in these high-profile political events showcased her growing influence within the Democratic Party.

Woorman's commitment to public service extended beyond her political roles. During the 2022 Maryland elections, she served as the campaign manager for Marc Elrich's reelection campaign and as the deputy finance director for Brooke Lierman's Comptroller campaign. Since 2023, she has worked as a public information officer for the Montgomery County government, further demonstrating her dedication to serving her community.

In April 2022, Woorman was selected to fill a vacancy on the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee. She was subsequently elected to this position in July 2022 and became the party's secretary in December 2022. Her leadership and dedication to the Democratic Party were evident in her efforts to prioritize housing affordability, ethics reforms, and health equity bills during her tenure.

Woorman's political career reached new heights in June 2024 when she applied to serve the remainder of Sara N. Love's term in the Maryland House of Delegates. Following a rigorous selection process, the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee voted to nominate Woorman, and she was sworn in on August 12, 2024. As a member of the Health and Government Operations Committee, she continues to advocate for policies that promote the well-being of her constituents.
