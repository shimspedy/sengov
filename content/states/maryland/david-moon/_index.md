David Hyon Moon was born on January 28, 1979, in Takoma Park, Maryland. He attended Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Maryland, and later pursued his higher education at Tufts University, where he earned a B.A. degree in sociology and psychology in 2001. He then attended the American University Washington College of Law, earning a J.D. degree in 2004.

Moon has had a diverse career, working for various activist groups. He served as the chief operating officer of FairVote from 2004 to 2009 and as the program director for Demand Progress since 2011. He also worked as the campaign manager for Jamie Raskin's 2006 campaign for the Maryland Senate and Nancy Navarro's 2009 campaign for the Montgomery County Council. In 2010, Moon opened his own consulting firm, Moon Strategies.

In 2011, Moon founded the blog Maryland Juice, which focused primarily on Maryland politics. In August 2013, OR Books published Hacking Politics, a book Moon co-wrote with Patrick Ruffini and David Segal.

In 2013, Moon launched a campaign for the Maryland House of Delegates, seeking to succeed Heather Mizeur and Tom Hucker, both of whom had sought other office in 2014. During the Democratic primary, he was endorsed by state senator Jamie Raskin, various local labor unions and organizations, including the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, CASA de Maryland, and NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland. Moon also ran on a slate alongside Raskin, state delegate Sheila E. Hixson, and William C. Smith Jr. He won the Democratic primary and later won the general election.

Moon was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 14, 2015, becoming one of the first Korean-Americans elected to the Maryland General Assembly alongside Mark S. Chang. Since 2023, he has served as the Majority Leader of the Maryland House of Delegates.
