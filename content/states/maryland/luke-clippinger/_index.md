Luke H. Clippinger is an American politician and lawyer who has served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing the state's 46th district in Baltimore, since 2011.

Born in Baltimore on September 24, 1972, Clippinger graduated from the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute and attended Earlham College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in politics in 1994. He also attended the University of Louisville, where he earned a Juris Doctor degree in 2005. He was admitted to the Maryland State Bar Association in 2007.

Clippinger has been involved in politics since he was seven years old, starting as a worker in Mary Pat Clarke's city council campaign. While attending Earlham, Clippinger conducted polls for various elections in Wayne County, Indiana, served as the communications director for the Wayne County Democratic Party from 1992 to 1994, and ran unsuccessfully for Wayne Township assessor in 1994.

After graduating, he interned for Indiana state senators Lindel Hume and Joe O'Day during the 1995 legislative session, afterwards working as an office manager for Baltimore mayoral election candidate Mary Pat Clarke. In 1996, Clippinger worked as an intern and was later named to manage the re-election campaign of U.S. Representative Lee Hamilton.

He worked as a community development specialist for the Indiana Department of Commerce until 1998, when he was named to manage the campaign of congressional candidate Baron Hill and, following his election to Congress, became Hill's district director until 2005.

In 2006, Clippinger was named as the campaign manager for Tom Perez's short-lived campaign for Attorney General of Maryland. Afterwards, he worked as a spokesperson for Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's mayoral campaign and as an assistant state's attorney in Anne Arundel County since 2007. Clippinger served as a member of the platform committee at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

In 2010, Clippinger ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 46, seeking to succeed retiring state delegate Carolyn J. Krysiak. He was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 12, 2011. He was a member of the Judiciary Committee from 2011 to 2015, afterwards serving in the Economic Matters Committee before returning to the Judiciary Committee as its chair in 2019.
