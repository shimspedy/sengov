Malcolm L. Augustine is a Democratic member of the Maryland Senate from the 47th district. He was born in Lafayette, Louisiana on March 10, 1969. He graduated from Pittsford Mendon High School in Pittsford, New York and later attended Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he earned an A.B. degree in government in 1991. He is a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

Augustine entered politics in 2012 by becoming the co-chair of Progressive Cheverly. At the same time, he became the chair of the Cable Television Commission in Prince George's County, Maryland. In 2014, Augustine unsuccessfully ran for state delegate in District 47A, coming in fourth place and losing to Jimmy Tarlau and Diana Fennell.

In 2015, Prince George's County executive Rushern Baker appointed Augustine to represent Prince George's County on the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) Board of Directors. In August 2017, Augustine declared his candidacy for Maryland Senate, seeking to replace state senator Victor Ramirez, who sought to become the next Prince George's County State's Attorney. He won the Democratic primary with 84.1 percent of the vote and the general election with 93.0 percent of the vote.

Augustine was sworn into the Maryland Senate on January 9, 2019. Since 2023, he has served as the president pro tempore of the Maryland Senate. He has been assigned to several committees including the Finance Committee, Joint Committee on the Management of Public Funds, Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive and Legislative Review, Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee, Joint Committee on Federal Relations, Joint Electric Universal Service Program Work Group, Joint Committee on Behavioral Health and Opioid Use Disorders, and Joint Committee on Children, Youth, and Families.

He is also a member of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland, Maryland Legislative Latino Caucus, and Co-chair of the Maryland Legislative Transit Caucus. Augustine introduced legislation in the 2020 session that would ban plastic carryout bags from all stores and require stores to charge a minimum of 10 cents for paper bags.
