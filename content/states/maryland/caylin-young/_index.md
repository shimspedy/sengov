Caylin A. Young, born on October 18, 1987, is an American politician. He is a member of the Maryland House of Delegates for District 45 in Baltimore City. He previously served as the public policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland.

Young graduated from Hampton University with a Bachelor's degree in mathematics. He later attended the University of Baltimore School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree. Young interned for the Maryland Court of Appeals, served as a legal fellow to U.S. Senator Cory Booker, and was a legislative assistant for former state senator Nathaniel J. McFadden and former state delegate Cheryl Glenn. He also served as the legislative director for then- Baltimore City Council president Brandon Scott.

In 2018, Young unsuccessfully ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 45, coming in fourth place. In December 2019, Young applied to fill a vacancy in the Maryland House of Delegates to serve the rest of the term of state delegate Cheryl Glenn, who resigned and pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges. In January 2020, the Baltimore City Democratic Central Committee voted to nominate Chanel Branch to the seat, with Young placing second behind Branch.

In January 2021, the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland hired Young to serve as its public policy director. He left the ACLU in December to serve as the deputy director for the Baltimore City Office of Equity and Civil Rights. In 2022, Young ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 45, running on a ticket with state senator Cory V. McCray and Jackie Addison, a community activist. He won the Democratic primary, narrowly defeating incumbent state delegate Chanel Branch.

Young was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 11, 2023. He is a member of the House Judiciary Committee. In January 2024, Young attended and spoke at a rally at the Maryland State House to support a resolution calling on Maryland's congressional delegation to support a ceasefire in the Israelâ€“Hamas war.
