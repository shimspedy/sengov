Dana Max Stein was born on September 19, 1958, in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended public schools in Baltimore County and later graduated from Milford Mill High School. He furthered his education at Harvard College, where he earned a B.A. degree in government. He also attended the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Affairs at Princeton University, where he earned a Master of Public Affairs degree. Additionally, he holds a Juris Doctor degree from Columbia University School of Law, which he earned in 1985.

After graduating, Stein worked as an attorney for the Washington, D.C. -based law firm Squire, Sanders & Dempsey until 1992. In the same year, he founded Grassroots Recycling, a local recycling group. Later that year, he and eventual Maryland lieutenant governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend founded Civic Works, a nonprofit organization that supported Baltimore-based urban service projects, including the restoration of the Clifton Mansion.

Stein first became involved in politics in 1994, when he unsuccessfully ran for the Baltimore County Council in District 2, challenging incumbent councilmember Kevin Kamenetz. In 1996, he became the president of the Baltimore County Central Committee. Stein was later the committee's treasurer from 1996 to 2002 and its chair from 2001 to 2002.

In May 2002, following Governor Parris Glendening's appointment of state delegate Michael Finifter to the Baltimore County Circuit Court, Stein applied to serve the remainder of Finifter's term in the Maryland House of Delegates. The Baltimore County Central Committee voted to nominate Stein in June, and he was appointed by Glendening and sworn in on June 25, 2002.

Stein has served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 11B in Baltimore County, since 2007. A member of the Democratic Party, he has served as the speaker pro tempore of the Maryland House of Delegates since 2024.
