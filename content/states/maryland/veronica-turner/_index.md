Veronica L. Turner, born on February 7, 1950, in Washington, D.C., is an American politician who represents District 26 in the Maryland House of Delegates. She attended Prince George's Community College, Tennessee State University, and the George Meany Center for Labor Studies.

From 1996 to 2018, Turner served as the president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 63. After the death of Prince George's County councilmember James C. Fletcher Jr. in 1994, Turner unsuccessfully ran in the special election to serve the rest of his term. She unsuccessfully ran again for the County Council in 2002, losing to Tony Knotts in the Democratic primary by just over 200 votes.

Turner was a member of the House of Delegates from January 8, 2003, to January 14, 2015. She declined to run for re-election in 2014, instead running for Maryland Senate and challenging incumbent state Senator C. Anthony Muse. She lost to Muse in the Democratic primary election, coming 2,000 votes shy of defeating him.

Turner was re-elected to the House of Delegates in 2018 and was sworn in on January 9, 2019. She has served on several committees, including the Economic Matters Committee, Ways and Means Committee, and Health and Government Operations Committee. She has also been a member of the Joint Committee on Health Care Delivery and Financing, and the Joint Committee on Children, Youth, and Families.

Turner has held other memberships as well, such as being the 2nd Vice-chair of the Prince George's County Delegation from 2012 to 2014. She has been involved in various subcommittees and has co-sponsored several pieces of legislation, demonstrating her commitment to public service and the well-being of her constituents.
