Wayne A. Hartman

Born on December 14, 1967, in Baltimore, Maryland, Wayne A. Hartman is a Republican member of the Maryland House of Delegates. He serves in District 38C, representing Wicomico County and Worcester County, including Ocean City, Maryland. He previously served on the Ocean City Council for one four-year term.

Early Life

Hartman attended Eastern Vocational Technical High School and graduated from the University of Phoenix, earning a B.S. degree in business administration in 2006. He bought his first property in Ocean City, Maryland at the age of 19 and, as of March 2016, owns 40 units in the resort town. Hartman is married and has two children. He is the owner of Wayne Hartman Management LLC, a management services company in Ocean City, Maryland. Since 2019, he has served on the Atlantic General Hospital Foundation Board of Directors.

Political Career

In 2014, Hartman was elected to serve on the Ocean City Council after receiving the endorsement of Citizens For Ocean City alongside three other candidates. As councilman, Hartman oversaw the construction of barrier systems on the boardwalk and the controversial refurbishment of memorial plaques on the boardwalk's benches. Hartman also served as the chairman for the Recreation and Parks Committee, as a member of the Police Commission, and on the Ocean City Noise Board. Prior to that, he sat on the ADA Committee as well as the Property Review and Enforcement Strategies for Safe Housing Committee.

In December 2017, Hartman announced his candidacy for the Maryland House of Delegates after incumbent delegate Mary Beth Carozza said she would challenge state senator Jim Mathias in the 2018 Maryland Senate elections. He prevailed in the Republican primary with 49.3 percent of the vote and ran unopposed in the general election. Hartman was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019. He served on the Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2020, afterwards serving in the Ways and Means Committee. Since 2022, Hartman has served as the chief deputy minority whip.

Political Positions

In November 2023, Hartman criticized the Juvenile Justice Reform Act, a bill that passed in the 2022 legislative session which restricted the state's ability to charge juveniles for most offenses, blaming it for an increase in juvenile crime in the state.
