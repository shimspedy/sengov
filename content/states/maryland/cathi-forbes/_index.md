Cathi Forbes, born on June 15, 1965, in Cleveland, Ohio, is an American politician of the Democratic Party. She represents District 43B in the Maryland House of Delegates. Interestingly, Cathi Forbes never intended to run for office. After two decades as a successful community leader and education advocate, the office found her.

For more than 20 years, Cathi Forbes has successfully advocated for her community. She led the recent campaign to rebuild Towson High School, and an earlier fight to build West Towson Elementary and improve conditions at Rodgers Forge, Stoneleigh, and Dumbarton. She’s helped develop more green space and playgrounds, secured funding for the coming Six Bridge walking trail, and worked to save Towson Manor Park from destruction. As Towson’s representative in the Maryland House of Delegates, Cathi continues to vote like an advocate for education, the environment, health care, and social justice.

Cathi Forbes represents the greater Towson area in the Maryland House of Delegates. She is a longtime community and education advocate. She has been a member of the House of Delegates since October 29, 2019. She is a member of the Appropriations Committee since 2020 and has been part of the education & economic development subcommittee since then. She is also a member of the Maryland Legislative Transit Caucus since 2019 and Women Legislators of Maryland since 2019. She served as the Mediation Coordinator for Orphans’ Court, Baltimore County, from 2014 to 2019.
