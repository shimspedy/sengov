Regina T. Boyce is an American politician who currently serves in the Maryland House of Delegates. She is a Democrat who represents the 43rd Legislative District of the state of Maryland.

Born on August 7, 1976, in Washington, DC, Boyce graduated from the Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County, Maryland. She later attended Catonsville Community College and Towson University, where she earned a B.S. degree in kinesiology and psychology in 1998. She also holds a M.P.A. degree from the University of Baltimore, which she earned in 2014.

After graduating, she became the director of the Adult Learning Center for Strong City Baltimore. Boyce ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in 2018, her first run for elective office. During the primary election, she formed a slate with state Senator Joan Carter Conway and state Delegate Maggie McIntosh.

Boyce was sworn in as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019. In April 2019, Boyce resigned from the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland ahead of the vote to protest comments made by Delegate Darryl Barnes, the caucus chair, that she found "unacceptable and infuriating".

In August 2021, Boyce was appointed to a commission to study Maryland state parks and make recommendations on new parks in "recreational deserts" and upgrades to existing parks. In 2023, Speaker Adrienne Jones announced Boyce as one of two Chief Deputy Whips.

She has been a member of several committees and memberships including the Environment and Transportation Committee, State Park Investment Commission, Maryland Legislative Latino Caucus, Maryland Legislative Transit Caucus, and Women Legislators of Maryland. She was also a past member of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland.
