LaToya Nkongolo is a dedicated and accomplished politician currently serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 31 in Anne Arundel County. Born on August 8, 1978, in Wilmington, Delaware, she has built a career centered around mental health advocacy and public service.

Nkongolo's educational journey began at Christiana High School in New Castle County, Delaware. She then attended Delaware State University, where she earned a Bachelor of Social Work degree. Her pursuit of higher education continued at Springfield College, where she obtained a Master's degree in Organizational Management and Leadership. Nkongolo furthered her academic achievements by earning a Master of Social Work degree from the University of Maryland, Baltimore.

With over 25 years of experience as a licensed therapist, Nkongolo has made significant contributions to the field of mental health. She is the owner of Work Life Behavioral Health and Professional Training, LLC, a mental health facility she founded. Her professional journey also includes roles such as Family Program Supervisor at Anne Arundel Medical Center and Deputy Executive Director at Nick's Place, a drug and alcohol treatment center.

Nkongolo's commitment to public service is evident through her involvement in various organizations and initiatives. She served as the President of the Maryland Addiction and Behavioral Health Professionals Certification Board from 2015 to 2018. Additionally, she has been a member of the Board of Directors for the Baltimore-Washington Medical Center Foundation and an adjunct professor at Anne Arundel Community College.

In 2022, Nkongolo ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 31B, advocating for children's mental health and opposing school shutdowns and COVID-19 mandates. Although she was defeated in the Republican primary election, she continued her political journey by running for the Anne Arundel County Board of Education in 2024. During her campaign, she aligned herself with Moms for Liberty, supporting initiatives to restrict books in school libraries and increase parental control over school curriculum.

Nkongolo's dedication to her community and her passion for mental health advocacy have earned her numerous accolades, including the Distinguished Graduate Award for the treatment and advocacy of mental health from Leadership Anne Arundel in 2020 and the Outstanding Community Service Award from the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland in 2022.

As a member of the Maryland House of Delegates since January 10, 2025, Nkongolo serves on the Judiciary Committee, where she is involved in the Civil Law and Procedure Subcommittee and the Public Safety Subcommittee. Her legislative efforts focus on issues such as juvenile justice, public safety, and health insurance coverage for scalp cooling systems.

Nkongolo's personal life is equally fulfilling. She is married to Bamoyo Nkongolo, and together they have two children. Her dedication to her family and her community continues to drive her efforts in making a positive impact on the lives of those she serves.
