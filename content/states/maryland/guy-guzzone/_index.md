Guy Joseph Guzzone was born on March 27, 1964, in Baltimore. He graduated from Parkville High School and attended the University of Maryland, College Park, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and government & politics in 1986. He later earned his Master of Public Administration degree in public management as a MacArthur Graduate Fellow in 1988.

Guzzone first got involved in politics as a college intern for U.S. Representative Bill Nelson. He later served as a special assistant to county councilmember Shane Pendergrass from 1991 to 1995. In 1994, Guzzone was appointed to the Kings Contrivance village board of directors, serving as its chair from 1995 to 1998. From 1996 to 1998, he served as the state director of the Maryland Sierra Club.

In October 1997, Guzzone announced that he would run for the Howard County Council in District 3, seeking to succeed Republican Dennis R. Schrader, who unsuccessfully ran for county executive. He ran unopposed the Democratic primary in September 1998, and faced Republican Wanda Hurt in the general election. The election was seen as the most competitive in the county, as the winning candidate would decide who held the majority on the county council.

Guzzone has served as a member of the Maryland Senate representing District 13 since 2015, and as its majority leader from 2019 to 2020. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously represented the district in the Maryland House of Delegates from 2007 to 2015, and as a member of the Howard County Council from 1998 to 2006.

As a senator, Guzzone has been the chair of the budget and taxation committee since 2020. He also chairs the health and human services subcommittee. A tireless advocate for education, he has fought to improve student performances and facilities in Howard County and the state.

Guzzone's political career has been marked by his commitment to public service and his dedication to the people of Maryland. His work in the Maryland Senate has been characterized by his efforts to improve the lives of his constituents and his commitment to the principles of the Democratic Party.
