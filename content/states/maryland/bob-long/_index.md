Robert B. Long, also known as Bob Long, is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from the sixth district since 2015. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland on January 11, 1957.

Long was raised by a single mother and attended Essex Community College and the Community College of Baltimore County. Before entering politics, he was a GRI-designated realtor for Covenant Realty and a former union truck driver. He is a member of the Maryland Association of Realtors, the Greater Baltimore Board of Realtors, the Henrietta Lacks Legacy Group, and the National Rifle Association.

Long first ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in 2010, but was defeated by incumbents Johnny Olszewski, Joseph J. Minnick, and Michael H. Weir Jr. in the general election. He was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates alongside Republicans Robin Grammer Jr. and Richard W. Metzgar in the 2014 Maryland House of Delegates election, during which the three ran on a platform involving economic issues. He was sworn in on January 14, 2015, and has served as a member of the Ways and Means Committee during his entire tenure.

Long keeps a brick from the former Sparrows Point steel mill on his desk as a reminder "of where we've been and where we have to go". During the 2019 legislative session, Long introduced a bill that would fine parents $1,000 if their child gets into trouble at school four times. In 2023, he introduced the Parent and Guardian Accountability Act, which would require parents to participate in counseling with their student after repeating a notice of repeated disruptive behavior during school hours.

In August 2022, Long signed onto a letter asking Governor Larry Hogan to keep the Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant under the Maryland Environmental Service's control, expressing concerns that the plant would "resort back to mismanagement" if given back to the city of Baltimore. During the 2018 legislative session, Long supported legislation to provide $8.5 billion in tax incentives to Amazon to build their second headquarters in Montgomery County, hoping that Amazon locating in Maryland would bring jobs to his district.

Long is married and has four children.
