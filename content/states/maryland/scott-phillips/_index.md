Phillips first became involved with politics in 2002, when he ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 10. Despite not advancing out of the primary, his passion for public service remained undeterred.

Phillips holds a B.S. in Accounting from Virginia Union University (1983) and a J.D. from the Francis King Carey School of Law at the University of Maryland (1989).

Before his political career, Phillips had a successful career in the private sector. He was a Portfolio Executive from 1983 to 2008 and a Client Services Leader from 2005 to 2012 at IBM Global Services. He was also the Managing Partner at N. Scott Phillips and Associates from 1995 to 2014 and the Director of Federal and Public Sector at Precision Task Group from 2012 to 2014. Currently, he is the Managing Member at N. Scott Phillips Legal and Business Consulting Services since 1989 and the Project Director and Consultant at MBDA Advanced Manufacturing Center since 2016.
