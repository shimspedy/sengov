Brian Michael Crosby was born on December 5, 1982, in Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Monsignor Bonner High School in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania in 2001. He then attended Drexel University, where he received a B.A. in business administration. Crosby later attended Western Michigan University Cooley Law School where he received his J.D. and was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar and New Jersey Bar in 2008.

Starting in 2011, Crosby served in the U.S. Army after completing Officer Candidate School. While in the Army, he completed the Infantry Officer Leadership Course, Ranger School, and Airborne School and deployed to Afghanistan three times. He currently serves as a Captain in the Maryland Army National Guard.

In September 2017, Crosby announced his candidacy for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 29B, seeking to challenge incumbent Republican Delegate Deb Rey. He defeated Rey in the general election with 53 percent of the vote, or by a margin of about 700 votes.

Crosby was sworn in as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019. In 2021, House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones appointed Crosby to serve as vice chair of the Economic Matters Committee, succeeding Delegate Kathleen Dumais.

Crosby supports the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a sweeping education reform bill passed by the legislature during the 2020 legislative session that would provide schools with $3.8 billion a year for 10 years.
