Todd B. Morgan (born January 1, 1956) is an American politician. He is a member of the Maryland House of Delegates for District 29C in St. Mary's County, Maryland. He was previously a member of the St. Mary's County Board of Commissioners from 2010 to 2022 and served as its vice president in 2014.

Background:
Morgan was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Susquehanna University with a bachelor's degree in business administration. He later attended Marshall University, where he earned his Master of Business Administration degree. Morgan moved to St. Mary's County in 1979 following graduation.

Career:
Morgan began his career by working at federal United States Department of Defense contractor Science Applications International Corporation in finance and acquisitions. He also previously taught classes for 20 years at various local colleges, including College of Southern Maryland, St. Mary's College of Maryland, and the University of Maryland Global Campus, and as an adjunct assistant professor at Embry-Riddle University. From 2004 to 2010, he was the president of the Southern Maryland Navy Alliance.

Political Career:
In 2010, Morgan was elected to the St. Mary's County Board of Commissioners, and was re-elected in 2014 and 2018. He served as the board's vice president in 2014. In August 2016, Morgan applied to fill a vacancy in the Maryland House of Delegates left by the appointment of state delegate Tony O'Donnell to the Maryland Public Service Commission. The St. Mary's County Republican Central Committee included Morgan on its list of three potential nominees, but Governor Larry Hogan appointed former Calvert County commissioner Jerry Clark to the seat in September. In February 2022, Morgan filed to run for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 29C, seeking to succeed retiring state delegate Jerry Clark. He defeated Maryland Adjutant General Timothy Gowen in the Republican primary on July 19, receiving 64.8 percent of the vote. Morgan endorsed former Maryland Secretary of Commerce Kelly Schulz for governor in 2022.
