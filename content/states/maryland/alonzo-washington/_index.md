Alonzo T. Washington

Born on September 2, 1983, in Washington, D.C., Alonzo T. Washington is an American politician who has made significant contributions to the state of Maryland. Raised by his mother, Elizabeth Washington, Alonzo and his five siblings lived in a homeless shelter in College Park, Maryland, when he was eight years old. Despite these early challenges, Alonzo graduated from Laurel High School in Laurel, Maryland, where he was a member of both the track and football teams.

Alonzo attended the University of Maryland, College Park, with help from the First Generation College Bound nonprofit. He earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice in 2007. During his time in college, he played football during his freshman year and was a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Alonzo is the first person in his family to graduate from both high school and college.

After graduating, Alonzo worked for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops as a paralegal. In 2008, he moved to the Prince George's County Council where he worked as a community liaison and chief of staff to Prince George's County councilmember William A. Campos. Alonzo first got involved with politics in 2005 by becoming a member of the Prince George's County Young Democrats association. He was a member of the Prince George's County Democratic Central Committee from 2010 to 2014, serving as its secretary from 2012 to 2014. He has also been a member of the Roosevelt Democratic Club since 2012.

After the resignation of Delegate Justin D. Ross, the Prince George's County Democratic Committee recommended Alonzo to the Governor to fill the vacated seat. Governor Martin O'Malley appointed Alonzo to fill the seat on December 4, 2012. Alonzo was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on December 19, 2012.

In 2023, Alonzo was appointed to the Maryland Senate to represent District 22, which covers Prince George's County. He has served on several committees, including the Finance Committee, the Judicial Proceedings Committee, and the Joint Subcommittee on Program Open Space and Agricultural Land Preservation. He has also been a member of the Maryland Correctional Enterprises Management Council.

Alonzo T. Washington continues to serve the people of Maryland with dedication and commitment, striving to make a positive impact in his community and beyond.
