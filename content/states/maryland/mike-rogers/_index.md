Michael J. Rogers, born on February 20, 1964, in Detroit, Michigan, is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Maryland House of Delegates. He represents Maryland's District 32 in Anne Arundel County.

Rogers attended Hillcrest High School in Dalzell, South Carolina, and graduated from New Hanover High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1982. He served in the U.S. Army Medical Service Corps from 1986 to 2015, serving in positions ranging from platoon leader to brigade commander and retiring at the rank of colonel. He had deployments in 32 countries including combat deployments in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan. His service awards include the Bronze Star, Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, and Defense Superior Service Medal.

Since retiring from the Army, he has served as a member of the Military Officers Association of America board of directors from 2012 to 2018 and has coached football at the Severn Athletic Club for five seasons.

In January 2018, Rogers announced his candidacy for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 32. The district was targeted by the Maryland Republican Party and the Republican State Leadership Committee, who had hoped to defeat the Maryland Democratic Party's supermajority in the legislature. He won the Democratic primary, placing third in a field of seven candidates and receiving 18.4 percent of the vote, and defeated his Republican challengers in the general election with 19.9 percent of the vote.

Rogers was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019, and has served in the Economic Matters Committee during his entire tenure. In December 2020, Rogers became the first Black person to serve as vice chair of the Anne Arundel County Delegation, and became the first Black man elected as the delegation's chair in November 2021.

He is currently a candidate in the 2024 election to the U.S. House of Representatives in Maryland's 3rd congressional district.
