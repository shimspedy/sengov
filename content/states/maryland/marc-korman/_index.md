Marc Alan Korman (born September 21, 1981) is an American politician from Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party who currently serves in the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 16 in Montgomery County. He previously served as the Majority Leader of the Maryland House of Delegates from January to May 2023.

Korman was born in Rockville, Maryland on September 21, 1981. He graduated from Richard Montgomery High School in 1999, and entered the University of Southern California at 17 years old, where he earned a B.A. degree in history in 2002. He then attended Johns Hopkins University, where he earned an M.A. degree in government with honors in 2007, and the University of Maryland School of Law, where he earned a J.D. degree magna cum laude in 2010.

Korman first got involved with politics at USC, unhappy about the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore. Following the ruling, Korman joined, and later became president of, the university's Young Democrats Club. He also interned for California governor Gray Davis and worked as a staff assistant at the Kalsman Institute at Hebrew Union College.

After graduating from USC, Korman began working as a legislative aide to Congressmen Brad Sherman of California and Brian Baird of Washington. Korman was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 2010 and the District of Columbia Bar in 2011. Since 2010, he has worked as an associate at the law firm Sidley Austin, practicing in communications and transportation litigation.

Korman declared his candidacy for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 16 on June 10, 2013. Korman won the Democratic primary election, receiving 21.8 percent of the vote, and later won the general election with 22.1 percent of the vote.

On January 5, 2023, Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates Adrienne A. Jones named Korman as the House Majority Leader, succeeding Eric Luedtke. He stepped down as Majority Leader following the conclusion of the 2023 legislative session to become the chair of the Environment and Transportation Committee.
