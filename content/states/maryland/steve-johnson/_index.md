Steven C. Johnson was born on December 30, 1960, in Garrison, Kentucky. He attended Shady Spring High School and Raleigh County Vocational Technical Center. Johnson served in the Army National Guard from 1977 to 1987, and as an auxiliary police officer in Aberdeen from 2006 to 2016. He also worked as a construction supervisor at Locust Point Shipyard and owns the Johnson Family Pharmacy in Aberdeen.

From 2005 to 2017, Johnson worked as the director of Economic Development for the city of Aberdeen, Maryland. He ran for the Aberdeen City Council in 2007, but he was disqualified shortly before the general election for not living within the city limits. Johnson initially challenged his disqualification, but dropped his legal challenge, saying that he didn't "want to alter the natural outcome of the election".

In 2014, he unsuccessfully ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 34A. Johnson won election to the Maryland House of Delegates in 2018, edging out incumbent state delegate Glen Glass by a margin of 165 votes. He was sworn in on January 9, 2019, and has served as a member of the Health and Government Operations Committee during his entire tenure. Since 2023, Johnson has served as deputy majority whip.

Johnson is married with three children. In February 2021, during debate on a bill to stagger the terms of elected Harford County school board members, Johnson supported an amendment to create a fully-elected school board in the county. The amendment failed in a 4-4 tie. During the 2020 legislative session, Johnson voted against legislation requiring background checks for sales of shotguns and rifles.

During the 2020 legislative session, Johnson introduced the "Connor's Courage" Act, named for Havre de Grace High School student Connor Sheffield, which would allow students to take medical marijuana at school. The bill passed and became law. During the 2019 legislative session, Johnson voted for legislation to raise the state minimum wage to $15 an hour.
