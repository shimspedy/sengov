Jessica Marie Feldmark, born on August 1, 1974, is a Democratic member of the Maryland House of Delegates. She was born as Jessica Marie Page and later married Joshua Feldmark. She resides in Columbia, Maryland, U.S.

Feldmark attended Goucher College, where she earned a B.A. degree in sociology and international relations. She furthered her education at American University, where she earned a M.S. degree in organization development.

In 1998, she moved to Columbia, Maryland and was elected to the Wilde Lake Village Board in 2000. She resigned from the board in November 2002 to become a special assistant to Howard County councilman-elect Kenneth Ulman.

Feldmark followed Ulman into the executive's office following his election in 2006, first serving as a senior advisor until 2009, when she became Ulman's Chief of Staff. Following the election of Howard County executive Allan Kittleman in 2014, Feldmark was let go from her position to make room for Kittleman chief of staff Diane Wilson. A few hours after her departure, the Howard County Council announced that Feldmark would serve as the council's administrator, replacing Sheila Tolliver.

In February 2018, Feldmark filed to run for Maryland House of Delegates. She came in third place in the Democratic primary election, receiving 21.4 percent of the vote. Feldmark came in second place in the general election, receiving 21.9 percent of the vote.

Feldmark was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019. In January 2020, Feldmark filed to run as a convention delegate for Elizabeth Warren at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

She is a member of the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Biotechnology. She is also the House Chair of the Howard County Delegation, a member of the Maryland Legislative Latino Caucus, Maryland Legislative Transit Caucus, and Women Legislators of Maryland.

Feldmark introduced legislation during the 2020 legislative session that would expand Maryland's public financing program to candidates other than the governor in statewide elections.
