John Frederick "Johnny" Mautz IV was born on September 19, 1970, in Fort Devens, Massachusetts. He is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Maryland Senate from District 37 since 2023. Before this, he represented District 37B in the Maryland House of Delegates from 2015 to 2023.

Mautz's father was stationed at Fort Devens before moving to the Eastern Shore of Maryland to start a dental care company. Mautz graduated from Brewster Academy, and later pursued higher education at the University of Dayton, where he received a B.A. degree in political science in 1994. He then went on to earn a J.D. degree from the Claude W. Pettit College of Law at Ohio Northern University in 1997.

Before serving in the Maryland House of Delegates, Mautz served as a counsel on the United States House Committee on the Judiciary from 1997 to 2002. He then served as a Special Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Governor Bob Ehrlich from 2002 to 2005, and as legislative director for U.S. Representative Howard Coble from 2009 to 2014.

Mautz is married to his wife, Rebecca, and they have two children. He owns the Carpenter Street Saloon in Saint Michaels, Maryland.

In 2014, Mautz was elected to the House of Delegates, succeeding delegates Adelaide Eckardt and Jeannie Haddaway. He was sworn in on January 14, 2015, and was a member of the Economic Matters Committee. During the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Mautz supported businessman Donald Trump.

In February 2022, after much speculation, Mautz filed to run for Maryland Senate, challenging incumbent state Senator Adelaide Eckardt in the primary. He defeated Eckardt in the Republican primary and won the general election on November 8, 2022. Mautz was sworn in on January 11, 2023, and is a member of the Finance Committee.

In terms of political positions, during a debate on a bill to ban privately made firearms in March 2022, Mautz introduced an amendment to create a special unit on firearm violence in Baltimore. The amendment was rejected in a vote. During the 2023 legislative session, Mautz supported legislation to increase penalties for gun crimes.
