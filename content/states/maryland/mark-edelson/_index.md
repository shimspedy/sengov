Born in Pretoria, South Africa, he immigrated to the U.S. and has since made a significant impact in his adopted home.

His late mother’s guiding principle: “If you can, you must,” drives Mark today in his vision and work to ensure that every resident of Baltimore City has the same opportunity, hope, and experience that lifted his family from their hardships.

Mark is a Canton homeowner, where he lives with his fiancée Shaina and their cat Boots. If elected, he will be just the fourth foreign-born immigrant serving in the Maryland House of Delegates. Mark is an active member of Volo City Sports where he plays on a local soccer team. Mark was the lead singer of an indie-rock band in high school.
