April R. Rose is an American politician who is a member of the Republican Party. She represents the fifth district in the Maryland House of Delegates and has also served as the Assistant Minority Leader since 2021.

Rose was born in Salisbury, Maryland, in 1968 or 1969. She graduated from Arlington Baptist High School and attended Villa Julie College from 1986 to 1987. Rose worked as an underwriter for Countrywide Home Loans from 2001 to 2005, afterwards working as a licensed real estate salesperson for Main Street America Reality until 2008. She has worked as an IT recruiter for NMR Consulting since 2009.

Rose first got involved in politics in 2002 as a member of the South Carroll Republican Club, eventually becoming its president. She was also a member of the Carroll County Republican Central Committee from 2004 to 2010. In 2008, Rose started working as an events coordinator for the Maryland Republican Party before resigning after party chair James Pelura fired the party's executive director Justin Ready in July 2009, which sparked infighting between Pelura and members of the Maryland General Assembly that eventually ended in Pelura's ouster. In 2010, she became a communications coordinator for the Maryland Republican Caucus.

In 2014, Governor Martin O'Malley appointed Rose to the Carroll County Board of Elections. Rose was appointed by Governor Larry Hogan to fill a vacancy left by state delegate Justin Ready, who was appointed to fill a vacancy in the Maryland Senate left by state senator Joseph M. Getty. She was sworn in on March 16, 2015, and was elected to a full four-year term in 2018.

Rose was a member of the Health and Governments Operations Committee from 2015 to 2017, and has served in the Ways and Means Committee since 2017. During the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Rose said she initially supported Texas governor Rick Perry but supported Donald Trump once he became the Republican nominee, agreeing with his positions on fiscal issues and citing her distrust for Hillary Clinton.

Rose is married and has four children. She self-identifies as "pro-life" and opposes euthanasia. During the 2016 legislative session, she supported legislation to ban abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy. In 2019, Rose introduced an amendment to the state budget that sought to remove Medicaid funding for abortions, which was rejected in a 41-93 vote.
