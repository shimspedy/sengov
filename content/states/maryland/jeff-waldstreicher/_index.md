Jeffrey D. Waldstreicher was born on December 31, 1979, in Silver Spring, Maryland. He graduated from Montgomery Blair High School and later attended Emory University, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and history. He received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 2003, where he was an editor for the California Law Review.

Waldstreicher was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 10, 2007, where he served on the Judiciary Committee until 2015, and on the Economic Matters Committee from 2015 to 2019. In July 2017, Waldstreicher announced his candidacy for the Maryland Senate in District 18, seeking to succeed state senator Richard Madaleno, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018.

In March 2018, he was accused of encouraging Helga Luest to run for his seat in the Maryland House of Delegates to make it harder for his primary challenger, Dana Beyer, to win the Democratic primary. Waldstreicher denied Luest's allegations in a statement sent to Bethesda Magazine, but did not comment further. His opponents also accused him of dodging candidate events, which Waldstreicher said he missed because of a sickness and legislative duties.

Waldstreicher won the Democratic primary on June 26, 2018, defeating Beyer with 49.4 percent of the vote. He ran unopposed in the general election. Waldstreicher was sworn into the Maryland Senate on January 9, 2019, where he serves as the vice-chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee and the Chair of the Joint Committee on Federal Relations.

Waldstreicher is a member of the Democratic Party. He is currently a member of the Maryland Senate, representing District 18 in Montgomery County after serving two terms in the Maryland House of Delegates. He lives in Kensington, Maryland. He is married and has three children.
