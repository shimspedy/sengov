Born on January 28, 1957, in Boston, Massachusetts, Ken Kerr's journey in education started at Frederick Community College, where he earned an A.A. degree in general studies in 1976. It was here that he met his future wife in a philosophy class. They got married in 1984.

After Frederick Community College, he attended Hood College, earning a B.A. degree in music in 1981. After graduating, he worked as a fourth-grade teacher for Frederick County Public Schools from 1983 to 1986. During this time, he led a group of fourth-graders through the Maryland State House, sparking his interest in public service.

After teaching, Kerr worked in the information technology field for 10 years, working various jobs including computer repair and writing software manuals. This experience led him back to academia, earning a M.S. degree in professional writing from Towson University in 1995.

Kerr then worked as an English professor at several community colleges, including Cecil College, Frederick Community College, Hagerstown Community College, Harford Community College, and Worâ€“Wic Community College. Since 1999, he has worked as an English professor at Frederick Community College, serving as the chair of the English department from 2011 to 2017. He later attended Morgan State University, where he earned a Ed.D. in 2003.

In 2014, Kerr ran for the Frederick County Board of Education but was unsuccessful. However, he ran again in 2016 and was elected to the board, serving from 2016 to 2018.

Kerr was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019. Since then, he has sat on the Health and Government Operations Committee. He is also an associate member of the Maryland Legislative Latino Caucus, as well as the Veterans Caucus.
