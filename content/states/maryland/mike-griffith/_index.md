Mike Griffith is a Republican member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing District 35B. He has been serving in this position since January 7, 2020. He was first elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in November 2022 and has been a member since January 11, 2023.

Griffith was born in Baltimore, Maryland and graduated from Joppatowne High School in Joppa, Maryland. In 1995, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps, serving as a military police officer, supervisor, and liaison until 2002. Upon his return to the United States, Griffith served on various community boards, including the Maryland Building Industry Association, the Harford County Economic Development Advisory Board, and the Arc Northern Chesapeake Region.

Before joining the Maryland House of Delegates, Griffith served in the United States Marine Corps as a military police officer. Griffith is also the Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer of HPS Management, a commercial property management company.

In 2018, Griffith entered into politics by becoming a member of the Harford County Republican Central Committee. Griffith was elected the chair of the committee in 2019. Griffith was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 7, 2020.

In the legislature, Griffith has been assigned to the Ways and Means Committee since 2021. Prior to that, he was a member of the Judiciary Committee from 2020 to 2021. He has also been a member of the Maryland Veterans Caucus since 2020 and has been on the house executive board since 2022.

Griffith is an advocate for in-person learning, having supported students and parents in Harford County that pushed for schools to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, Griffith signed a letter calling on the Harford County Board of Education to give parents the choice as to whether they want their child to return to school or to learn remotely, and giving teachers the same option.

During the 2021 legislative session, Griffith introduced two bills aimed at increasing aid to students with special needs. The first bill, the Education Equality for All Act, would require school systems to give parents the information and funding necessary to update their childâ€™s individual education program. The second bill, the Vulnerable Student Protection Act, would require schools to provide special education, behavioral health, counseling, and nutritional services on an in-person basis to at-risk students.
