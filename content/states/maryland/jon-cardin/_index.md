Jon Steven Cardin was born on January 12, 1970, in Baltimore, Maryland. He comes from a family that has a unique dedication to public service in Maryland. He sits in the legislative seat formerly occupied by his uncle, Senator Ben Cardin, great uncle, Delegate Maurice Cardin, and grandfather, the Honorable Judge Meyer Cardin.

Cardin's early education was at The Park School of Baltimore. He then attended Tufts University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Relations in 1992. He furthered his education at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where he earned a Master of Public Service degree in Policy Sciences in 1996. He also earned a Master of Arts degree in Judaic Studies with honors from Baltimore Hebrew University in 1996. Cardin completed his education with a Juris Doctor degree with honors from the University of Maryland, Baltimore, in 2001.

Before studying law, Cardin was recruited as executive director of The Project Judaica Foundation in Washington, DC from 1996-1998. He began his career teaching Spanish and coaching lacrosse and basketball as faculty at Mercersburg Academy from 1992 to 1994.

After being admitted to the Maryland Bar in 2001, he clerked for Baltimore City Circuit Court Judge William D. Quarles Jr. until 2002. Afterwards, he started his own law firm, Jon S. Cardin, P.A.

Cardin represented the 11th District of Northwest Baltimore County in the Maryland House of Delegates for three terms from 2003 to 2014. As a member of the Ways and Means committee, he focused his legislative agenda on protections for children and families, election law, education reform, environmental policy, and simplification of the tax code.

Cardin returned to the House of Delegates in 2019 with a goal of protection for women, children, minorities, vulnerable communities, and the environment. He was appointed to the Judiciary Committee, the Criminal Law and Procedure subcommittee, and chairs the Civil Law and Procedure subcommittee.

Jon lives with his wife and daughters. They attend Beth Tfiloh and Beth Israel synagogues and make Sabbath dinners a priority. Jon participates in a wide range of community activities, including serving on the board of the Jewish Community Center of Greater Baltimore, BHU, the National Association of Jewish Legislators, and the MD Attorney Grievance Commission Peer Review Panel.
