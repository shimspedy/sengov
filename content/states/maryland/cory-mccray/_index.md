Cory V. McCray was born on October 31, 1982. He is an American politician who serves as a member of the Maryland Senate for Maryland's 45th district, located in northeast Baltimore City. Before his tenure in the Senate, McCray served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates and acting Chair of the Maryland Democratic Party.

McCray was born and raised in Baltimore. He attended Fairmount-Harford High School in east Baltimore. His mother played a crucial role in changing his life trajectory when she noticed him going down the wrong path as a teenager. She enrolled him in an apprenticeship program at the age of 18, and soon after, he became a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. By the age of 20, he had purchased his first home and would go on to buy several rental properties while earning his bachelor's degree.

McCray began his political career in 2014 when he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates, representing the 45th District. Leading news outlets like Center Maryland called him one of the most effective freshman legislators in the entire state. His approach to public service is listening to the problems of his constituents and finding a solution.

McCray passed the Action and Power Apprenticeship Act when they asked for better jobs. The legislation expanded funding for apprenticeships that lead to family-supporting careers. His resilient spirit and commitment to lifting the voice of those often silent led to him building a solid coalition of legislators from across the state to overturn a veto from the former governor of Maryland to restore voting rights to thousands of Marylanders.

When he is not in the community, McCray looks forward to spending as much time as possible with his wife and four children in Northeast Baltimore. He continues working for his local union and as a community organizer to this day, helping expand the opportunity for a better life for men and women across our city and state.
