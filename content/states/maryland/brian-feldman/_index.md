Brian Jeffrey Feldman was born on February 4, 1961, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School and went on to attend Pennsylvania State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting in 1983. He then attended the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, earning his Juris Doctor degree in 1986. Feldman later attended Johns Hopkins University, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in government in 2000.

After graduating from law school, Feldman worked as an attorney and certified public accountant for Price Waterhouse until 1988. He then began working as a trial attorney for the United States Department of Justice Tax Division. He has worked as an adjunct professor for Johns Hopkins University since 2006, and for the University of Maryland, College Park since 2019.

Feldman was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 8, 2003. In June 2013, state senator and then-Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Garagiola announced that he would resign from the Maryland Senate on September 1.

On September 10, 2013, the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee voted unanimously to nominate Feldman to fill the vacancy left by Garagiola. He was appointed to the Maryland Senate by Governor Martin O'Malley on September 12, 2013. Feldman successfully ran for election to a full term in the Maryland Senate in 2014, defeating perennial candidate Robin Ficker in the general election.

He has also been a member of the Executive Nominations Committee, Legislative Policy Committee, Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, Rules Committee, Joint Information Technology and Biotechnology Committee, Joint Committee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Biotechnology, and Workers Compensation Benefit and Insurance Oversight Committee.
