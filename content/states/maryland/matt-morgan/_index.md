James Matthew Morgan, known as Matt Morgan, was born on February 5, 1973, in La Plata, Maryland. He attended Maurice J. McDonough High School in nearby Pomfret, Maryland.

Morgan began his career as a computer technician and construction cost estimator at William H. Metcalf in 1994. He then worked as a system engineer and technician at AAA Networks in 1999, and as a network analyst and information technology assistant manager at Fulbright and Jaworski in 2000. In 2001, he became a lead technical specialist at the College of Southern Maryland. In addition to his work in information technology, Morgan also became a realtor at O'Brien Realty in 2005.

In April of 2010, Morgan filed to run for the House of Delegates. He lost a very close race to a very popular Delegate, Johnny Wood. However, in 2014, he ran again and, after a ton of hard work from faithful supporters like his wife Kathy, his son Tyler, and his daughter Sarah, he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates.

Morgan was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 14, 2015. From 2019 to 2021, he served as the Assistant Minority Leader of the House of Delegates. In 2021, Morgan ran for Minority Leader of the House of Delegates on a ticket with Delegate Mark N. Fisher.

As a member of the House of Delegates, Morgan has served on the Health and Government Operations Committee since 2015. He has also been a member of the Joint Committee on Federal Relations since 2019 and served as the Chair of the St. Mary's County House Delegation from 2019 to 2023.

Morgan is a member of several organizations, including the Mechanicsville Moose Lodge, St. Mary's Republican Club, Maryland Association of Realtors, National Hot Rod Association, and National Rifle Association. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Southern Maryland Association of Realtors in 2014.

Morgan resides in Mechanicsville, Maryland, with his wife and two children.
