Kent A. Roberson (born 1985) is an American politician who is currently a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from District 25. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee and graduated from Frederick Douglass High School. He later attended Ball State University, earning a bachelor's and master's degree in political science in 2002 and 2007, and the Wesley Theological Seminary, where he earned a Master of Divinity degree in 2003.

Roberson first got involved in politics during high school in 2002, working as a student page for the Maryland House of Delegates. In 2013, he started work in the Maryland General Assembly mailroom. After graduating, Roberson worked as an intern for U.S. Representative Albert Wynn, later serving as a senior government relations manager for the Corn Refiners Association and the vice president of the Prince George's County Parent Teacher Student Association. In 2021, Roberson was appointed as the African-American Diversity Leadership chair for the state of Maryland.

In 2018, Roberson was elected to the Prince George's County Democratic Central Committee for District 25. He was re-elected to a second term after running unopposed in 2022, subsequently becoming the committee's chair. Also in 2018, Roberson unsuccessfully ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 25, placing fifth with 6.4 percent of the vote. In 2022, Roberson unsuccessfully ran for the Prince George's County Board of Education, losing to small business owner Lolita Walker. During the 2020 presidential primaries, Roberson unsuccessfully ran for national delegate to the Democratic National Convention, pledged to Elizabeth Warren. He later served as an elector for Maryland's 5th congressional district in the 2020 United States presidential election.

In April 2023, Roberson applied to fill a vacancy left by the resignation of state delegate Darryl Barnes. He was unanimously nominated by fellow members of the Prince George's County Democratic Central Committee on May 5, 2023. Roberson was sworn into office on May 30, 2023.

Kent is married to his wife, Jamii. Together, they have three children.
