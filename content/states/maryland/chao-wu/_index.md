Chao Wu is a distinguished member of the Maryland House of Delegates for District 9A, which includes parts of Howard and Montgomery counties. He assumed office on January 11, 2023.

Born in Yingshan, Hubei, China, Wu moved to the United States for his higher education. He earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2001. He then went on to earn a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2003. He furthered his education at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2009.

Before his political career, Wu worked in various roles in the private and public sectors. He specialized in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cybersecurity, and enterprise risk management. He worked as a Senior Electrical Engineer at Maryland Aerospace Inc., an Aviation Software Engineer at Garmin International, and a Senior Research and Development Engineer at Hillcrest Labs. He also served as a Senior Data Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton.

Wu has been an active member of his community. He served on the board of directors for the River Hill community of Columbia, Maryland until 2018, and was a board member of the River Hill Village Association from 2012 to 2018. He was instrumental in initiating Columbia's sister city agreement with Liyang.

In 2018, Wu was elected to the Howard County Board of Education, where he served until 2022. In December 2020, he was elected as the Board of Education's chairperson, becoming the first Asian American to lead the board. In October 2021, he was named to serve as a board member to the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.

In February 2022, Wu filed to run for the Maryland House of Delegates. He won the Democratic primary in July 2022, and later won the general election in November, narrowly defeating incumbent state delegate Trent Kittleman. He was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 11, 2023. He currently serves on the Ways and Means Committee, and is a member of the education subcommittee and local revenues subcommittee. He is also the Treasurer of the Maryland Legislative Asian-American and Pacific Islander Caucus.
