Richard W. Metzgar, also known as Ric Metzgar, is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from the sixth district since 2015.

Born and raised in Essex, Maryland, on November 28, 1953, Metzgar's father worked for the Glenn L. Martin Company and his mother owned a dry cleaning business and worked for the Maryland Republican Party. Metzgar graduated from Kenwood High School and attended Northwest Bible College where he earned a clinical pastoral education certificate. He also attended the Community College of Baltimore County.

Metzgar is a small business owner, working as the general manager of G & W Motors from 1989 to 2015 and as the president of My Son's Parking, Inc. from 1994 to 1998. He was also the owner of the original Essex Diner. Metzgar started the Gateway Pastors and Churches Association and served as a ministry leader for several area churches and as an associate pastor at Essex Church of God from 2004 to 2014.

In 2006 and 2010, Metzgar was an unsuccessful candidate for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 6. During his 2010 candidacy, he ran on a platform involving environmental and economic issues, including deregulation, pollution, and public safety.

Metzgar was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates alongside Republicans Robin Grammer Jr. and Robert B. Long in the 2014 Maryland House of Delegates election, during which the three ran on a platform involving economic issues. He was sworn in on January 14, 2015. Metzgar was a member of the Ways and Means Committee from 2015 to 2017, afterwards serving in the Health and Government Operations Committee until 2019. He has since served as a member of the Appropriations Committee.

In July 2015, after Governor Larry Hogan announced that he had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Metzgar held a "Hogan Strong" vigil in Bel Air. Metzgar served as an alternative delegate for the 2020 Republican National Convention. During the 2022 Maryland gubernatorial election, he endorsed state delegate Dan Cox, calling his opponent Kelly Schulz a "third term" of Governor Larry Hogan, whom he criticized for disapproving of Cox and former President Donald Trump.

Metzgar is married and has two adult children.
