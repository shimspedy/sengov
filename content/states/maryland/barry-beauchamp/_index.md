Barry S. Beauchamp, born in 1956 or 1957, is an American business owner and politician who has been serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from District 38B since 2024. Raised in Wicomico County, Maryland, Beauchamp graduated from James M. Bennett Senior High School and attended Salisbury University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration and management.

Beauchamp has a long history of community service, having served as a volunteer firefighter, engineer, and assistant chief with the Salisbury City Fire Department for over 25 years. In addition to his public service, he has been a licensed realtor since 1987 and has operated his own excavation business, Beauchamp Brothers Construction, since 1985.

In 2022, Beauchamp was elected to the Wicomico County Republican Central Committee, where he ran a campaign opposing COVID-19 pandemic-related protocols and face masks. He served as the committee's chair in 2024 and was considered a political ally of Wicomico County Executive Julie Giordano. In September 2023, Giordano nominated Beauchamp to the Wicomico County Personnel Board, but his nomination was rejected by the Wicomico County Council. Later in 2024, Governor Wes Moore appointed Beauchamp to the Maryland State Board of Onsite Wastewater Professionals.

In July 2024, Beauchamp applied to fill a vacancy in the Maryland House of Delegates left by Carl Anderton Jr., who resigned to become the director of rural strategy within the Maryland Department of Commerce. During central committee interviews, Beauchamp expressed his desire to work in a bipartisan manner in the General Assembly and listed expanding the Salisbury Regional Airport, securing funding for a new health and human sciences building at Salisbury University, and improving streetscapes in Delmar as his priorities. The Wicomico County Republican Central Committee unanimously voted to nominate Beauchamp to fill the seat on August 5, 2024, and Governor Wes Moore appointed him to the seat on August 19. Beauchamp was sworn in on September 10, 2024.

As a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, Beauchamp serves on the Appropriations Committee, where he is part of the education and economic development subcommittee and the oversight committee on pensions. He continues to focus on issues such as public safety, education, and economic development.

Beauchamp is married to his wife, Susan, who is a member of the Wicomico County Board of Education from District 3 as of 2024. They have two daughters and four grandchildren. Beauchamp's dedication to his community and his extensive experience in both public service and business make him a valuable asset to the Maryland House of Delegates.
