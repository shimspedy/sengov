Shaneka Tarae Henson, born on July 29, 1983, in Annapolis, Maryland, is a dedicated public servant and attorney. She has been a member of the Maryland Senate representing the 30th district since January 8, 2025. Before her tenure in the Senate, Henson served in the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 30A from May 16, 2019, to January 8, 2025. She also held the position of alderwoman on the Annapolis City Council from December 4, 2017, to April 29, 2019.

Henson's early life was marked by resilience and determination. Raised by her parents, who were both pastors at the New Life Presbyterian Church in Annapolis, she faced challenges head-on. At the age of 19, while attending Coppin State University, she became pregnant and lived in public housing while raising her child. Despite these obstacles, Henson graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Coppin State University and later earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Baltimore.

Admitted to the Maryland Bar in 2010, Henson began her legal career working for the Anne Arundel County State's Attorney's office and the YWCA. In 2020, she founded her own law firm, Johnson Legal Group LLC. Her dedication to public service was further demonstrated when she graduated from a training course hosted by Emerge Maryland in 2016, an organization created to prepare potential female Democratic candidates for public office.

Henson's political career began with her successful run for the Annapolis City Council in 2016, where she challenged incumbent Alderman Kenny Kirby. After defeating her primary challenger, DaJuan Gay, with 67.8 percent of the vote, she ran unopposed in the general election and was sworn in on December 4, 2017. During her time on the city council, she was named acting mayor for two weeks in October 2018 by Annapolis mayor Gavin Buckley.

In April 2019, following the death of House Speaker Michael E. Busch, Henson was nominated by the Anne Arundel County Democratic Central Committee to serve the remainder of his term in the Maryland House of Delegates. She was re-elected in subsequent elections and served on various committees, including the Ways and Means Committee and the Appropriations Committee. Henson was also a member of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland, Women Legislators of Maryland, and the Maryland Legislative Latino Caucus.

Throughout her career, Henson has been recognized for her contributions to her community and state. She received the Sojourner Truth Award from Anne Arundel County in 2021 and was named one of Maryland's Top 100 Women by the Daily Record in 2024. Henson continues to serve her constituents with dedication and passion, striving to make a positive impact on the lives of those she represents. Married and a mother of one, she balances her professional and personal life with grace and determination.
