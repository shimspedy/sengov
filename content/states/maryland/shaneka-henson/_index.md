Shaneka Tarae Johnson, known as Shaneka Henson, was born on July 29, 1983, in Annapolis, Maryland. Her parents, both pastors at the New Life Presbyterian Church in Annapolis, raised her in a community-focused environment.

Henson pursued her undergraduate studies at Coppin State University, graduating in 2006 with a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice. She continued her education at the University of Baltimore, where she earned her Juris Doctorate in Law.

Before embarking on her political career, Henson spent nearly a decade as a practicing attorney. She worked for the Anne Arundel County State’s Attorney Office and the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA). In 2020, she co-founded her own law firm, Johnson Legal Group, LLC.

Henson's political journey began in 2017 when she was elected to represent Ward 6 in the Annapolis City Council. As a council member and Alderwoman, Henson was known for her advocacy and commitment to protecting the City of Annapolis and its residents.

In May 2019, following the death of House Speaker Michael E. Busch, Henson was appointed as an American Democratic member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 30A. She has served on several committees, including the Appropriations Committee, Ways and Means Committee, and subcommittees for education, health, social services, and the oversight committee on pensions.

Throughout her career, Henson has received several awards in recognition of her service and leadership. These include the "Her-Story" Award (2019), Sojourner Truth Award (2020), Fannie Lou Hammer Award (2021), and the Trailblazer Award (2022).
