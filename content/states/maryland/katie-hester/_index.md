Katie Fry Hester, born Kathryn A. Fry on December 31, 1974, is a Democratic member of the Maryland Senate from the 9th District, which is based in Howard County and Montgomery County.

## Early Life and Career
Hester was born in New York, U.S. She attended Cornell University in 1997, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural and biological engineering. After graduating, she worked as a senior analyst at Arthur D. Little from 1998 to 2001 and as the manager of research and advocacy at SustainAbility from 2001 to 2009. She also is a Maryland first responder and volunteers for WISP Ski Patrol.

Hester got involved in politics following the 2016 presidential election out of concern that political divisiveness in Washington was spilling over into her community. Hester joined liberal groups like Indivisible and Do the Most Good and created a small group called Building Bridges with the aim of bringing civility back to her community. She attended the 2017 Women's March on Washington with her two daughters, Sierra and Alexa.

In July 2017, Hester filed to run for Maryland Senate, challenging Republican incumbent Gail H. Bates. She was uncontested in the Democratic primary, and state Senate Democrats viewed the District 9 Senate election as a potential pickup opportunity given the national environment. She defeated Bates in the general election by 531 votes, and was the only Democrat to oust a Republican senator in Maryland in the 2018 Maryland Senate election.

## In the Legislature
Hester was sworn into the Maryland Senate on January 9, 2019. She is the first Democrat to represent District 9 in the Maryland Senate since Senator Charles Smelser in 1994.
