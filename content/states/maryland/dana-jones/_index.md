Dana Celeste Jones, born on June 26, 1976, is an American politician who is a Democratic member of the Maryland House of Delegates from District 30A. She was born in Cumberland, Maryland. Her mother was a longtime member of the Allegany County Democratic Central Committee and her father was the president of the local American Postal Workers Union.

Jones graduated from Fort Hill High School and attended Towson University, where she earned her Bachelor of Science degree in sociology in 1998. Jones first became involved in politics while in college, where she was a member of the university's College Democrats organization and worked as a campaign manager for Robert Zirkin's 1998 House of Delegates campaign.

Afterwards, she worked as a legislative aide to U.S. Representative Ben Cardin until 2001, when she began working as a senior researcher for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and later for EMILY's List. Jones has worked as an independent political consultant since 2013. During the 2018 Anne Arundel County executive election, Jones worked on Steuart Pittman's campaign and helped him prepare for debates against Steve Schuh.

In April 2020, following the resignation of state delegate Alice J. Cain at the end of the 2020 legislative session, Jones applied to serve the remainder of Cain's term in the Maryland House of Delegates. The Anne Arundel County Democratic Central Committee voted to recommend Jones to the seat later that month, and she was appointed by Governor Larry Hogan on April 23, 2020. Jones was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on May 1, 2020, and was elected to a full four-year term in 2022.

She was a member of the Ways and Means Committee from 2020 to 2023, afterwards serving in the Appropriations Committee. In 2023, she swapped assignments with state delegate Shaneka Henson after questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest involving Henson's legal work for a nonprofit which received state funding.

Jones is married to her husband, Jude Meche. Together, they have a son. Upon being sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates, Jones said she would prioritize health care, small business, and food insecurity.
