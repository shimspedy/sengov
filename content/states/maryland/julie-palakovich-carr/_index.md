Julie Palakovich Carr was born on April 22, 1983, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. She attended Boston University, where she earned a B.A. degree in biology in 2005. She then went on to the University of Minnesota, where she earned a master's degree in biology in 2007.

Before holding elected office, Palakovich Carr served on several city task forces, including serving two terms on the Environment Commission, chairing the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) Review Committee, serving as vice chair of the City Services and Budget Work Group, and chairing the Watersheds Committee.

In addition to her elected career, Palakovich Carr worked for a decade in science policy, including as public policy manager for the American Institute of Biological Sciences. She also co-founded a political technology startup, Victory Guide, that helps candidates run for local office.

In November 2013, at the age of 29, she became the youngest woman ever elected to the Rockville City Council. She was re-elected in 2015 and served until early 2019. During her two terms, Palakovich Carr sponsored successful legislation to make Rockville a sanctuary city, ban smoking in outdoor dining areas, strengthen the city's animal cruelty laws, and create a water conservation program for seniors and low-income families.

In 2016, she was recognized as a Leading Woman by the Annapolis Daily Record for her community involvement and professional accomplishments. Palakovich Carr announced her candidacy for the Maryland House of Delegates on July 6, 2017. After incumbent Delegate Andrew Platt announced that he would not seek re-election in the 2018 elections, Delegates Kumar Barve and James W. Gilchrist formed a slate with Palakovich Carr in advance of the Democratic primary elections.

Currently, she is a member of the Democratic Party who serves in the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 17 in Montgomery County. She serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, where she chairs the Early Child Subcommittee. Julie has championed legislation to ease barriers to voting, make roads safer for pedestrians and bicyclists, and to close corporate tax loopholes. Julie serves as Chair of the Montgomery County House Delegation and Secretary of the Transit Caucus.
