Kriselda Valderrama-Lobo, known as Kris Valderrama, is an American politician who represents District 26 in the Maryland House of Delegates. She was born on November 17, 1970, in Washington, D.C. to David Mercado Valderrama, a judge in Prince George's County, Maryland, and a Maryland State Delegate representing District 26. Kris Valderrama is of Filipino ancestry.

She completed her high school education at Oxon Hill Senior High School and went on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in respiratory therapy from Salisbury University. After graduation, she worked as a Respiratory Therapist, CRT, at Inova Fairfax Hospital from 1996 to 1999.

In addition to her medical career, Valderrama has also been involved in media and communications. She served as an Anchor and Co-host for Valderrama's America from 1997 onwards. She also worked with the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME) in various roles from 1992 to 2012.

Valderrama was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 10, 2007. Since 2022, she has served as the Deputy Majority Leader of the Maryland House of Delegates. She has been a member of several committees including the Economic Matters Committee, Rules and Executive Nominations Committee, and the Judiciary Committee. She has also served as the House Chair for the Joint Committee on Workers' Compensation Benefit and Insurance Oversight since 2015.

In addition to her legislative duties, Valderrama holds memberships in several other organizations. She is the Chair of the Bi-County Committee, Prince George's County Delegation, a member of Women Legislators of Maryland, the Maryland Legislative Asian-American and Pacific-Islander Caucus, and the Maryland Legislative Transit Caucus.

Valderrama has been a strong advocate for paid family leave. She introduced legislation during the 2020 legislative session to provide all Maryland workers with up to 12 weeks of paid family leave. The bill was reintroduced in 2022 and became law after the General Assembly voted to override Governor Larry Hogan's veto.

In the realm of national politics, Valderrama endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on April 9, 2016.

Kris Valderrama is married to Abraham A. Lobo and they have two children. They reside in Fort Washington, Maryland.
