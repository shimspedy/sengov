Justin D. Ready is an American politician who has served as a member of the Maryland Senate since 2015, representing District 5 in Carroll County. He previously represented the district in the Maryland House of Delegates from 2011 to 2015.

Born on April 15, 1982, in Mobile, Alabama, Ready moved to Westminster, Maryland, at the age of 11 after living in Mississippi. He graduated from Carroll Community College in 2002, and afterwards attended Salisbury University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 2004.

Ready became interested in politics at a young age. After graduating from Salisbury, he worked as a field director on the 2004 U.S. Senate campaign of E. J. Pipkin. He later worked as a legislative aide to state delegate J. B. Jennings from 2004 to 2006, afterwards working as the chief of staff for state senator Janet Greenip.

In April 2008, the Maryland Republican Party named Ready as its executive director, replacing John Flynn. He served in this position until July 2009, when he was fired by party chairman James Pelura for "personnel reasons". Ready's firing eventually led to the removal of Pelura as chairman of the Maryland Republican Party. Ready later served as an interim executive director from July to December 2011.

Also in 2008, Ready unsuccessfully ran for delegate to the Republican National Convention, pledged to Mike Huckabee. On January 5, 2010, Ready announced that he would run for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 5A, challenging incumbent state delegates Nancy R. Stocksdale and Tanya Thornton Shewell. He won the Republican primary, placing first with 39.3 percent of the vote, and later defeated Democrats Francis X. Walsh and Sharon L. Baker in the general election alongside Stocksdale.

Ready was sworn in on January 12, 2011, and served as a member of the Health and Government Operations Committee. He ran for re-election to a second term in 2014. Ready was a member of Larry Hogan 's Change Maryland organization, and later served Hogan's transition team following his upset victory in the 2014 Maryland gubernatorial election.

Ready (Republican Party) ran for re-election to the Maryland State Senate to represent District 5. He won in the general election on November 8, 2022. Ready served in the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 5 from 2010 to 2015. Ready served as House chief deputy minority whip from 2013 to 2015. He served as executive director of the Maryland Republican Party from 2008 to 2009.
