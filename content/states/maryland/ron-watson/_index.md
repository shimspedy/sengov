Ronald L. Watson, known as Ron Watson, was born on April 30, 1966, in Seat Pleasant, Maryland, U.S. He is an American politician who has served as a member of the Maryland Senate representing District 23 since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously represented District 23B in the Maryland House of Delegates from 2019 to 2021, and served on the Prince George's County Board of Education from 2006 to 2010.

Watson was born in Washington, D.C. His parents were both retired school principals. Watson graduated from Central High School and attended Morgan State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1991; Binghamton University, where he earned a Master of Science degree in advanced technology in 1993 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in systems science in 1999; and George Washington University, where he earned a Master of Business Administration degree in 2002. He is a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

Watson served in the U.S. Army Reserves from 1989 to 2006, during which he worked as a program manager at Lockheed Martin, IBM, and MCR. He graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College in 2004. Since 2004, Watson has owned his own business, Watson Management Corporation.

In 2006, Watson was elected to the Prince George's County Board of Education. He served in this position until 2010. Watson unsuccessfully ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 23B in 2014, challenging incumbents Marvin E. Holmes Jr. and Joseph F. Vallario Jr. He ran for the seat again in 2018, during which he defeated Vallario in a political upset.

Watson was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019. During his tenure, he served on the Judiciary Committee, including its family law and juvenile law subcommittees. In August 2021, following the resignation of state Senator Douglas J. J. Peters, Watson applied to serve the remainder of Peters' term in the Maryland Senate. He was unanimously nominated to the seat by the Prince George's County Democratic Central Committee later that month, and was appointed by Governor Larry Hogan on August 27.

Watson was sworn into the Maryland Senate on August 31, and was elected to a full four-year term in the 2022 Senate election. He was a member of the Judicial Proceedings Committee from 2021 to 2023, afterwards serving on the Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee.
