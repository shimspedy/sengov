Nancy J. King, born on October 7, 1949, is an American politician who has been a member of the Maryland Senate from the 39th district since 2007. She is a member of the Democratic Party and has served as the majority leader of the Maryland Senate since 2020. Before her tenure in the Senate, King represented the same district in the Maryland House of Delegates from 2003 to 2007.

King was born in Niagara Falls, New York, where she graduated from LaSalle High School and attended Niagara County Community College from 1967 to 1969. She later moved to Montgomery Village, Maryland, where she became the vice president of her family's consulting and forensic engineering company, Trecor Inc., in 1987.

In 1991, King was appointed to the Montgomery Village Foundation Board of Directors, where she served until 1996. In 1993, she became the president of the Montgomery County Council of Parent-Teacher Associations. King was elected to represent the first district of the Montgomery County Board of Education in 1994, serving until her election to the Maryland House of Delegates in 2002. During her tenure, King served as the board's president from 1997 to 1998 and from 2000 to 2001.

King was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 2002, and was sworn in on January 8, 2003. She served on the Ways and Means Committee and as deputy majority whip from 2006 to 2007. In July 2007, following the resignation of Patrick J. Hogan, King applied to serve the remainder of his term in the Maryland Senate. She was appointed to the seat by Governor Martin O'Malley and was sworn in on September 5, 2007.

King was elected to a full term in 2010 after defeating state delegate Saqib Ali in a competitive primary election. She ran with the backing of the Maryland Democratic Party establishment. King began serving as Senate Majority Leader on January 8, 2020.
