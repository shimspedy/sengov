Kym Taylor is an American politician and a member of the Maryland House of Delegates for District 23 in Prince George's County. She was born in Washington, D.C., on March 7, 1964. She graduated from the Duke Ellington School of the Arts in 1982. She later attended George Washington University, earning a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in information processing in 1986, and Atlanta University, where she received a Master of Business Administration degree in information systems and finance in 1988.

Taylor runs her own health care company, where she works as a marketing executive. She worked as an aide to state Senator Paul G. Pinsky. In August 2021, Taylor filed to fill the vacancy left by the appointment of state Delegate Ron Watson to the Maryland Senate. The Prince George's County Democratic Central Committee voted on September 14 to nominate its chair, Cheryl S. Landis, to serve the rest of Watson's term; Taylor received one vote.

In 2022, Taylor ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 23. She ran on a ticket alongside Watson, state Delegate Marvin E. Holmes Jr., and Jocelyn Collins. She won the Democratic primary on July 19, coming in third with 14.0 percent of the vote and edging out her opponent, Jocelyn Collins, by 16 votes. Taylor was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 11, 2023. She is a member of the House Judiciary Committee.

Taylor is married to her husband, Steve. In 2015, the Taylors purchased a $1.45 million home in Bowie, Maryland.
