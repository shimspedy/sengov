Craig Jason Zucker was born on March 23, 1975, in Englewood, New Jersey. He was raised in nearby Teaneck. He earned his Bachelor of Science from St. Thomas Aquinas College in 1997, and his masters degree in government from Johns Hopkins University in 2004.

Zucker first got involved in politics as a college intern for U.S. Senators Bill Bradley and Carl Levin, and later worked as a scheduler for Senator Barbara Boxer. He worked as a legislative director to Maryland state delegate Peter Franchot from 1999 to 2000, afterwards working as a deputy district director for U.S. Representative Albert Wynn until 2004.

Zucker served as the vice-chair of the Mid-County Recreation Advisory Board in Montgomery County, Maryland from 2004 to 2006, and as the deputy chief of staff to Comptroller Peter Franchot until 2010.

In 2002, Zucker unsuccessfully ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 14, placing fourth with 12.3 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary election.

Zucker was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 12, 2011, and was a member of the Appropriations Committee during his entire tenure. From 2015 to 2016, he served as the House chair of the Joint Audit Committee.

In December 2015, following the resignation of state senator Karen S. Montgomery, Zucker applied to serve the remainder of her term in the Maryland Senate. His candidacy was backed by Senate president Thomas V. Miller Jr. In January 2016, the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee voted to nominate Zucker to fill the seat, and Governor Larry Hogan appointed him to the seat at the end of the week. Zucker was sworn in on February 4, 2016.

Zucker was a member of the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee until 2018, afterwards serving in the Budget and Taxation Committee.

Zucker is known for providing top-notch constituent service and working across the aisle to sponsor and pass meaningful laws that reflect our shared values. Zucker has earned a reputation for being a tireless legislator and a champion for those with developmental disabilities. He was the chief sponsor of many pieces of legislation that provided equity and opportunities for this population.

Over his two terms in office, Zucker has ushered through groundbreaking legislation, including laws that protect minors from identity theft, assist homeowners facing foreclosure, and took the first steps towards upgrading Marylandâ€™s 911 system. Additionally, Zucker championed legislation that provides the opportunity for thousands of students with developmental disabilities to go to college. He also passed legislation that will provide services to more than 1,200 children on the Autism Waiting list and legislation that will provide vital support to Marylanders with disabilities currently on waiting lists.
