Charles Anthony Muse, born on April 17, 1958, is an American politician and minister who has served in the Maryland Senate representing District 26 since 2023, and previously from 2007 to 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented the district in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1995 to 1999.

Muse was born in Baltimore and was one of six children born to Gloria Watson. His early life was challenging as he was shuffled in and out of 11 foster homes and sometimes lived in the streets. He was expelled from three different school systems. However, his life took a turn when a United Methodist pastor, Rev. George Alvin Stansbury, took him in. This provided Muse with love, acceptance, stability, direction and lessons that would become the foundation of all that he would come to believe in and work to achieve.

Muse began working in the ministry at age 20, first preaching at the Mount Zion United Methodist Church in Ellicott City, where he became known for his dramatic preaching. He attended Morgan State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1981; Wesley Theological Seminary, where he earned a Master of Divinity degree in 1984; and Howard University, where he earned a Doctor of Ministry degree in church and community development in 1991.

As a senator, Muse fought for better public education, better teacher pay, smaller class sizes and a more effective system for evaluating student success. He worked side-by-side with labor unions for fair wages and labor practices and to save jobs. He championed legislation to support seniors, veterans, and Black-owned businesses. He also sponsored legislation to expunge the records of those who've served their time and paid their debt after committing minor offenses, who are striving to get jobs to support themselves and their families.

Today, C. Anthony Muse is an experienced public servant, committed civic activist, a community leader and longtime pastor whose single-minded focus is to serve the needs of people.
