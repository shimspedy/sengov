Frank Melvin Conaway Jr. (born January 4, 1963) is an American politician who serves as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing the 40th district.

Early Life and Education:
Conaway was born in Baltimore to Frank M. Conaway Sr., who was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates and later as the clerk of the Baltimore City Circuit Court, and Mary Conaway, who served as the Baltimore Register of Wills. He attended Northwestern High School and later attended Howard University and Morgan State University from 1980 to 1984, and graduated from Sojourner–Douglass College in 1999 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration.

Career:
After attending Morgan State, Conaway worked for construction firms Monumental Paint Contractors and Allied Bendix Corporation until 1986, when he started his own company, Frank M. Conaway Jr. & Associates Co., and replica kit-car business F-Dreams, Inc. Afterwards, he worked as a sales representative for various companies, including Olan Mills, from 1989 to 2005. In 1992, Conaway and his father accused Olan Mills of firing them after Conaway Sr. caught the company using a secret racial code to alert employees when they were scheduled to work at Black churches, which the company used to steer the Conaways away from more lucrative white parishes. Following his firing, Conaway Jr. filed a discrimination complaint with the company.

Political Career:
In 1999, Conaway unsuccessfully ran for President of the Baltimore City Council, losing to Sheila Dixon in the Democratic primary. In 2006, Conaway successfully ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 40. He was sworn in on January 10, 2007, and has been a member of the Judiciary Committee during his entire tenure.

Personal Life:
Conaway was married to his wife, Latesa Elaine Thomas, and had three children—Frank III, Kelly, and Lacynda—prior to their divorce in 2006.
