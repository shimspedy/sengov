Matthew J. Schindler is an American politician serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 2B. Born on November 22, 1983, in Hagerstown, Maryland, Schindler has dedicated his career to public service and community engagement.

Schindler's early life was rooted in Hagerstown, where he graduated from North Hagerstown High School in 2001. He pursued higher education at Hagerstown Community College and later earned a Bachelor of Science degree in computer networks and cybersecurity from the University of Maryland Global Campus in 2021.

Before entering politics, Schindler built a successful career in information technology. He worked as a computer network specialist for the Department of Social Services in Washington County from 2007 to 2012. He then served as a security administrator at First Data Corporation in 2012 and as a network administrator at Middletown Valley Bank from 2012 to 2014. Schindler's expertise in IT led him to the National Capital Bank of Washington, where he held the position of IT manager from 2014 to 2016. He later worked as a systems administrator at Leidos in Frederick, Maryland, from 2016 to 2022, before returning to the National Capital Bank of Washington as Vice-President and IT and Cybersecurity Manager in 2022.

Schindler's political journey began with his involvement in local government. In 2020, he ran for a seat on the Hagerstown City Council but was defeated in the nonpartisan primary election. However, in March 2023, Schindler was appointed to the Hagerstown City Council to fill the vacancy left by Tekesha Martinez, who became the mayor of Hagerstown. Schindler served on the city council until November 2024, when he ran for a full four-year term but was unsuccessful in the general election.

In December 2024, following the resignation of state delegate Brooke Grossman, Schindler applied to serve the remainder of Grossman's term in the Maryland House of Delegates. The Washington County Democratic Central Committee unanimously voted to nominate Schindler to the seat, and he was sworn in on January 7, 2025. As a delegate, Schindler serves on the Appropriations Committee, where he is involved in overseeing personnel matters and public safety and administration subcommittees.

Throughout his career, Schindler has been an advocate for various causes, including economic development, public safety, and education. During his 2020 city council campaign, he expressed concerns about the cost of a new stadium for the Hagerstown Suns and prioritized staffing and retention initiatives for the city's police and fire departments. Schindler also participated in a United Auto Workers strike at Hagerstown's Mack Trucks plant in October 2023, demonstrating his support for workers' rights.

In addition to his political and professional endeavors, Schindler has been actively involved in community organizations. He served as the president of Friends of Safe Place from 2015 to 2017 and volunteered in design, marketing, and promotion for Main Street Hagerstown from 2018 to 2022. Schindler also served on the board of directors for Hagerstown Federal Little League from 2021 to 2023.

Schindler's dedication to public service, combined with his extensive experience in information technology and community involvement, has made him a respected figure in Maryland politics. He continues to work towards improving the lives of his constituents and addressing the challenges facing his district and the state.
