Marlon D. Amprey is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing District 40 since 2021. He was born on January 24, 1987, in Baltimore. His grandparents came to Baltimore during the Great Migration. His uncle, Walter Amprey, served as the superintendent of Baltimore City Public Schools from 1991 to 1997.

Amprey graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2009 with a Bachelor of Arts in American government and politics. He then attended George Mason University, where he earned a Master of Education in elementary education and curriculum. He also holds a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, which he obtained in 2016. In the same year, Amprey earned a certificate in business management from the Wharton School.

In his early career, Amprey was a teacher for Howard Road Academy Public Charter School, a school in Washington, D.C., and was a member of Teach For America from 2009 to 2011. From 2011 to 2013, he was a sixth-grade teacher at The SEED School of Maryland. While attending law school, Amprey interned for U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings. He has served as the director of Patterson Park Public Charter School and Code in the Schools since 2016.

Amprey then worked as a corporate associate at Venable LLP from 2016 to 2019, afterwards working as an associate of DLA Piper until 2020. He worked as an associate at Cole Scholtz P.C. from 2020 to 2021, at McKennon Shelton & Henn from 2021 to 2022, and at Rosenberg Martin Greenberg LLP since 2022.

In December 2020, after state Delegate Nick Mosby resigned following his election as president of the Baltimore City Council, Amprey applied to serve the remainder of Mosby's term in the Maryland House of Delegates. His candidacy was backed by state Senator Antonio Hayes and Baltimore mayor-elect Brandon Scott. The Baltimore City Democratic Central Committee voted 4-3 to nominate Amprey to the seat on December 30, and Governor Larry Hogan appointed him to the seat on January 6, 2021. He was sworn in on January 13, 2021. Amprey was elected to a full four-year term in 2022.
