Since 2004, Howard has owned the Broadleaf Tobacco and Smoke Shop in Severna Park, Maryland.

Political Career

Howard ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in 2014, seeking to succeed delegate Robert A. Costa, who announced his intent to retire after redistricting moved him to District 33B. He defeated Anne Arundel County police lieutenant Jim Fredericks in the primary election, receiving 52 percent of the vote, and later defeated Democratic challenger Mitchelle Stephenson in the general election with 63.3 percent of the vote.

Howard was sworn into the House of Delegates on January 14, 2015, and has served as a member of the Economic Matters Committee during his entire tenure. In January 2020, the American Conservative Union gave Howard a score of 63 percent, making him the lowest-scoring Republican in the Maryland House of Delegates.

Howard has served as the Deputy Minority Whip for the Maryland House Republican Caucus since 2021, filling a vacancy left by the election of Delegate Christopher T. Adams to serve as the House Minority Whip. In February 2021, Howard was appointed as the chairman of the Maryland House Republican Caucus' Business and Economic Committee. In 2020, Howard was an alternate delegate for the Republican Party National Convention.

Personal Life

Howard is married and has a child.

Political Positions

In February 2017, Howard voted against a bill providing workers with up to seven days of paid sick leave a year, criticizing it as a burden for small businesses. During the 2018 legislative session, he introduced a bill that would require internet service providers to notify customers when their personal information is stolen in data breaches.
