David V. Fraser-Hidalgo is an Ecuadorian-born American politician and a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing District 15 in Montgomery County, Maryland. He was appointed to complete the term of Delegate Brian J. Feldman following Feldman's appointment to a Senate seat and has since been elected to his own full term.

Early Life and Education:
Fraser-Hidalgo was born on November 25, 1969, in Quito, Ecuador. He grew up in Montgomery County, Maryland, attending Albert Einstein High School in Kensington, Maryland. In 1992, he earned a B.A. in History from St. Mary's College of Maryland.

Career:
For three years, Fraser-Hidalgo served as a police officer in Montgomery County before leaving the police department and entering the business world. He has worked for a number of firms, including being a partner in a Montgomery County based tech firm for 10 years and as an Area Director for Regus. He has also been involved in a variety of volunteer activities in the county, including as a leader in the Boyds Civic Association and sits on the boards of the Montgomery County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Community Farm Share and the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.

Political Career:
In 2010, Fraser-Hidalgo unsuccessfully ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 15, coming in fourth place with 8.8 percent of the vote. In 2013, the retirement of Senator Robert J. Garagiola from the Maryland Senate prompted the appointment of Delegate Brian J. Feldman to fill the remainder of Garagiola's term. This left an open Delegate seat, which was contested by a number of applicants. Fraser-Hidalgo won the final vote of the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee by a close margin, and on October 16, 2013, was appointed by Governor Martin O'Malley to fill the seat. He was sworn in on October 21, 2013.

In February 2015, Fraser-Hidalgo joined state Senator Victor Ramirez and Delegates Joseline Peña-Melnyk, Maricé Morales, Will Campos, and Ana Sol Gutierrez in organizing the Maryland Latino Legislative Caucus, becoming one of the caucus' first six members. Fraser-Hidalgo served as the Latino Caucus' chair from 2019 to 2024.

Political Positions:
Environment: Fraser-Hidalgo has repeatedly introduced legislation that would ban the practice of fracking in Maryland.
