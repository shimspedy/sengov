Christopher T. Adams is a Republican member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 37B. He assumed office on January 14, 2015. His current term ends on January 13, 2027.

Adams was born on June 19, 1972, in Salisbury, Maryland, where he attended Wicomico High School in 1990. He graduated from Salisbury University with a Bachelor of Science in business management in 1994 and a M.B.A. in 1996. A fifth generation Eastern Shore native, he is married and has three children.

Adams worked as a salesman from 1992 to 1995 and sales manager from 1995 to 2001 at Value Carpet One. He has served as president of Value Carpet One since 2001. In October 2013, Adams declared his candidacy for the Maryland House of Delegates. He prevailed in the Republican primary alongside Johnny Mautz, earning 24.5 percent of the vote. He won the general election with 30.3 percent of the vote.

Adams has served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates since January 14, 2015, representing District 37B. He served as the House minority whip from April through December 2021. In 2018, Maryland Matters listed Adams as one of the ten most vulnerable House incumbents in the June 2018 General Assembly primaries. Adams would survive his primary with 29.9 percent of the vote and would be re-elected with 33.9 percent of the vote in the general election.

Adams is a self-described constitutional conservative who believes that the Constitution should be the basis for which lawmakers operate. In 2019, Adams voted to sustain Governor Larry Hogan's veto on legislation that would increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour. Adams opposed legislation introduced in the 2021 legislative session that would require government-funded construction projects to pay prevailing wages on contracts over $250,000 or when at least 25% of a project's construction costs are from state funds, arguing that the bill would hurt small, minority- and women-owned contractors the most and raise costs for smaller governments.
