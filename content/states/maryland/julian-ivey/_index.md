Robert Julian Ivey, known as Julian Ivey, was born on August 3, 1995, in Prince George's County, Maryland. He is the son of Glenn and Jolene Ivey. His father, Glenn Ivey, held the countywide office of state's attorney, and his mother, Jolene Ivey, currently serves on the Prince George's County Council.

As a sixth grader, Julian Ivey starred in the Broadway production of The Lion King, singing and dancing in the role of young Simba. He graduated from Eleanor Roosevelt High School in 2013. In 2018, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Maryland, College Park, where he was a member of the campus' NAACP chapter and led protests over campus police tactics and campus racism.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Ivey was elected to and attended the 2016 Democratic National Convention as a delegate for Bernie Sanders, and supported Hillary Clinton after she was nominated as candidate by the Democratic Party. In May 2017, Ivey was elected to the Cheverly town council. During his first year on the town council, he introduced and passed legislation to designate the town a sanctuary city.

In 2018, Ivey ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 47A, challenging incumbent state delegate Jimmy Tarlau. During the primary, he received endorsements from state senator Victor R. Ramirez, the local Service Employees International Union, and state comptroller Peter Franchot. During the 2018 gubernatorial primary, Ivey campaigned for former NAACP president Ben Jealous.

Ivey defeated Tarlau in the Democratic primary in June, placing second behind incumbent state delegate Diana M. Fennell with 32.5 percent of the vote to Tarlau's 29.6 percent. Ivey was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019. He was assigned to the House Ways and Means Committee and serves on its Financial Resources and Local Revenues subcommittees. Ivey is a member of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. Media outlets have described Ivey as a progressive.
