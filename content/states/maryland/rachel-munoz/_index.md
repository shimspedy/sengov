Rachel Parker Muñoz is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates since 2021. She is a member of the Republican Party. Initially, she represented the 33rd district from 2021 to 2023, and has since represented the 31st district.

Muñoz was born in 1986 or 1987. She graduated from Severna Park High School and later attended the University of Maryland, College Park, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2009. She majored in Psychology with a minor in Philosophy. Inspired by the need for advocacy in her community, she studied at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, where she explored, in depth, the issues Maryland is facing today. She graduated from the law school in 2021 with a J.D.

Muñoz served as a law clerk at Simons & Campbell in 2019, afterwards working as an editor of the Maryland Journal of International Law from 2019 to 2021. She became a law clerk at Schulte Booth PC in 2021.

In June 2021, Muñoz announced that she would run for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 33, and officially filed her candidacy a week later. In August, following the resignation of state delegate Michael E. Malone to serve as a state circuit court judge, she applied to serve the remainder of his term in the Maryland House of Delegates. Her candidacy quickly gained the support of state senator Edward R. Reilly and state delegate Nic Kipke, and she was nominated to fill the vacancy by the Anne Arundel County Republican Central Committee in October. Muñoz was appointed to the Maryland House of Delegates by Governor Larry Hogan on November 4, and was sworn in on November 8. She ran for election to a full four-year term in District 31 and won election in November 2022. Muñoz has served as a member of the Judiciary Committee during her entire tenure.

In 2023, Muñoz was nominated for a position on the Women's Caucus of Maryland's executive board, but declined the nomination after consulting with her Republican colleagues.

Muñoz is married and has five children. In April 2023, Muñoz was diagnosed with melanoma, which was removed during surgery in the following month.

Muñoz supports efforts to discourage illegal immigration and opposes providing illegal immigrants with taxpayer-funded benefits. In March 2022, during debate on the Abortion Care Access Act, Muñoz proposed an amendment that would ban abortions after 24 weeks. The amendment was rejected by a 40-85 vote. During the 2023 legislative session, Muñoz backed legislation to repeal the Juvenile Justice Reform Act, a bill that was introduced and passed in the previous year's legislative session that restricted the state's ability to charge juveniles for most offenses, and introduced a bill that would make firearm theft a felony.
