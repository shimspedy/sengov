Christopher R. West, known as Chris West, was born on April 7, 1950, in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Williams College, where he earned a B.A. degree in 1972, and the University of Pennsylvania School of Law, where he earned a J.D. degree in 1975. He was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1975.

West became involved in politics by working as an attorney for the Maryland Republican Party from 1982 to 1996, and again from 1998 to 2003 after serving as the executive director of the Republican State Central Committee for two years. In 1988, he filed to run for Delegate to the Republican National Convention, representing Jack Kemp. He came in tenth place in a field of 13 candidates, receiving one percent of the vote. During the 1994 Maryland gubernatorial election, West represented the Maryland Republican Party in a lawsuit challenging the results of the election.

In 1997, Semmes, Bowen & Semmes named West as a resident counsel in its Baltimore offices. He operated the commercial lending practice of the firm's banking, corporate, and securities practice group. In 1998, West was seen as a possible candidate to succeed Joyce Lyons Terhes, who had announced that she would not seek re-election as the state's GOP chairman after a series of key losses across the state. He was once again considered a possible candidate for the seat after chairman Richard D. Bennett announced his resignation at the end of the year. He sought election as Chairman of the Maryland Republican Party that year, but was defeated by Michael Steele, the party's first vice chairman.

In February 2003, Governor Robert Ehrlich appointed West to the Maryland State Arts Council. He served as the council's vice-chair from 2006 to 2007. In April 2013, West filed to run for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 42B.

West is a member of the Maryland Senate from the 42nd district, representing Central and Northern Baltimore County. He was previously a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from District 42B. He has been a member of the Senate since January 9, 2019. He has served on several committees and work groups, including the Judicial Proceedings Committee, the Marijuana Legalization Work Group, and the Senate Presidentâ€™s Advisory Work Group on Equity and Inclusion.
