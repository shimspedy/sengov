Christopher Eric Bouchat was born on October 2, 1967, in Baltimore, Maryland. He is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party.

Education:
Bouchat graduated from St. Augustine's Catholic School (now St. Augustine Elementary School) and Howard High School. He attended the Howard Vocational-Technical Center, where he earned a welding certificate. He also attended Catonsville Community College, where he earned a degree in business administration, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where he earned a degree in political science.

Career:
Bouchat worked as a welder with Patrick Aircraft Tank Systems in Columbia, Maryland, before starting his own welding business in 1994. He first became involved in politics in 1992, when he ran for the United States House of Representatives in Maryland's 3rd congressional district.
