Joseph Vogel, born on January 4, 1997, is an Uruguay-born American politician who has been serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from District 17 since 2023. He is a member of the Democratic Party and his district includes the Montgomery County cities of Gaithersburg and Rockville. He represents the district alongside fellow Democratic delegates Julie Palakovich Carr and Ryan Spiegel.

Early Life and Education:
Vogel was born in Montevideo, Uruguay to mother Gabriela and father David Vogel, an advisor to the Uruguayan government. He immigrated to the United States with his family when he was three years old due to his father's job as a diplomat for the International Monetary Fund. His family settled in Rockville, Maryland, upon immigrating to the United States. He became a U.S. citizen in November 2016. Vogel graduated from Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School and attended George Washington University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science in 2018. He later attended Harvard University, where he earned a master's in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School in 2022.

Career:
Vogel developed an interest in politics while in school, where he had been active in student government. He volunteered on Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign and later worked on Cheryl Kagan's 2014 State Senate campaign. Vogel was a college intern for then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Vogel took a year off of college at George Washington University to work on the national advance team of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. He later got involved in the March for Our Lives movement and in protests against the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, and worked as an advance lead for Ralph Northam's 2017 gubernatorial campaign and as advance director for Cory Booker's 2020 presidential campaign.

Vogel was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 11, 2023. He represents District 17, which includes the cities of Gaithersburg and Rockville. He is the youngest member of the Maryland General Assembly and, alongside Jeffrie Long Jr., is the first Generation Z member of the Maryland General Assembly.
