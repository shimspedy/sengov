Tiffany T. Alston, born on April 22, 1977, is an American politician who has represented Prince George's County District 24 in the Maryland House of Delegates since January 2023, and previously from January 2011 to January 2013. She was suspended from office in 2012 after being found guilty of stealing General Assembly funds to pay an employee at her law firm.

Alston was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland. She attended Seat Pleasant Elementary School. She graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a Bachelor of Arts in criminology & criminal justice and from David A. Clarke School of Law with a Juris Doctor in 2002. From 1999 to 2001, she was a volunteer teacher with the AmeriCorps National Service Corporation. From 2004 to 2005, she served as a Chief of Staff within the Division of Correction at the Maryland Department of Public Safety & Correctional Services. She is a former mentor of the I Have a Dream Foundation, and a member of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. From 2004 to 2012, she practiced law with her own law firm, which was located in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.

Alston's law license was suspended by the Maryland Court of Appeals on September 25, 2012, and she was disbarred on May 3, 2013. In the legislature, Alston was a member of the House of Delegates from 2011 to 2013 and served on the Judiciary committee. She was a member of the Prince George's County Delegation, the Women's Caucus, and the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. In 2022, Alston filed to run for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 24, seeking to succeed state delegate Jazz Lewis, who was running for Congress in Maryland's 4th congressional district. She won election to the seat and was sworn in on January 11, 2023, and has since served in the Health and Government Operations Committee. In January 2024, former Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby hired Alston to represent her in her disbarment case.

During the 2011 legislative session, Alston was a co-sponsor of "Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act". A similar bill was filed in the Maryland Senate (SB 116 - Civil Marriage Protection Act) and was assigned to the House Judiciary Committee, the committee on which Alston served.
