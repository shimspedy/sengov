Robbyn T. Lewis was born on July 18, 1963, in Gary, Indiana. Her ancestors escaped slavery in America through the Underground Railroad, but returned following the Civil War. Lewis' parents were among the first beneficiaries of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which allowed them to move from Gary to Chicago. She graduated from the Latin School of Chicago and later attended the University of Chicago, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in anthropology in 1990. She also earned a Master of Public Health in international health in 1998 from Columbia University.

After graduating from the Latin School, Lewis worked as a teacher at the YMCA International Language School in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and afterwards worked as a courier for Frontier Nursing Service. From 1990 to 1991, Lewis volunteered for the Peace Corps in Niger. After graduating from Columbia, Lewis worked as a research coordinator at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and as a consultant for Population Services International in Haiti.

After moving to Baltimore from Haiti in 1999, she worked at Jhpiego until 2006, first as a project specialist and then as a program manager for the organization's cervical cancer prevention program. Afterwards, Lewis worked for Family Health International from 2007 to 2009, as a senior research program manager for the Center for Immunization Research at the Bloomberg School of Public Health until 2011, and as a regional manager for the International Pregnancy Advisory Services in west and south Africa from 2012 to 2014. Since 2019, she has worked as a civic data fellow for the University of Baltimore.

Lewis first became involved with politics in 2002 as the secretary of Friends of Patterson Park and as the vice president for the Patterson Park Neighborhood Association, where she aided with efforts to plant trees along sidewalks. From 2011 to 2012, she started and ran her own political action committee to support the Red Line and served on policymaking committees for transportation projects in Baltimore within the Maryland Transit Administration and the Baltimore City Department of Transportation.

Robbyn T. Lewis is an American politician who has served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing the 46th district since 2017. She is also the first African American woman ever to represent District 46, which is made up of all the communities around Baltimore Harbor.
