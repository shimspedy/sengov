Jason Charles Gallion was born on February 10, 1977, in Havre de Grace, Maryland. He graduated from Havre de Grace High School in 1995 and later attended Harford Community College, where he earned an A.A. degree in political science in 1997.

From a young age, Gallion was involved in agriculture. He grew up helping his father, who worked for the State Highway Administration, raise beef cattle at home. He also worked as a teen at the dairy farms owned by his uncle, Nolan Gallion Sr., and the Hopkins family. After graduating from college, he became a farmer, producing dairy from 1999 to 2004 and beef cattle and hay from 2004 onward.

Gallion got his first glimpse of politics at 13 years old, when he volunteered for Barry Glassman's first council race in Harford County. In 2016, he joined Glassman's administration as a part-time agricultural specialist in the Harford County Department of Governmental and Community Relations. Gallion also serves on the county's Economic Development Agricultural Advisory Board and is the liaison from the county's executive office to the Harford County Farm Bureau.

In 2006, Gallion unsuccessfully ran for the Harford County Council in District D, finishing second to Chad Shrodes in the Republican primary. In 2007, Gallion applied to succeed delegate Barry Glassman, who had been appointed by Governor Martin O'Malley to the Maryland Senate following the resignation of senator J. Robert Hooper, in the Maryland House of Delegates. The Harford County Republican Central Committee voted unanimously to appoint attorney Howard Wayne Norman, Jr. to the House of Delegates.

In 2010, Gallion ran an unsuccessful campaign for District 35A of the Maryland House of Delegates, running on a ticket alongside Dave Tritt and seeking to unseat Norman. In 2011, Gallion served on the Harford County Council Redistricting Commission. In 2014, Gallion again ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 35B, seeking to succeed retiring delegate Donna Stifler and delegate Wayne Norman, who sought election to the Maryland Senate.

Jason Charles Gallion is a Republican member of the Maryland Senate from the 35th district in Cecil County and Harford County. He has been a member of the Senate since January 9, 2019. He is a member of the Education, Energy and the Environment Committee, and the Joint Subcommittee on Program Open Space and Agricultural Land Preservation. He also serves on the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics and the Joint Electric Universal Service Program Work Group.

Gallion is married and has four children.
