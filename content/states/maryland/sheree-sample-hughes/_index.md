Sheree L. Sample-Hughes is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing legislative district 37A in Dorchester and Wicomico Counties on the Eastern Shore, centered around Salisbury, since 2015. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

Born on September 13, 1977, Sample-Hughes grew up in Salisbury, Maryland, and attended Parkside High School. She earned a bachelor's degree in public relations from Delaware State University in 1999, and a master's degree in public administration from Wilmington University in 2014. She is a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

Sample-Hughes is married to her husband, Desmond, and they have two sons. She teaches at Wor-Wic Community College. In 2017, her son was involved in a serious incident that required him to be airlifted to the University of Maryland, Baltimore.

Sample-Hughes first got involved in public service as an affordable housing coordinator for Pocomoke City. From 2002 to 2004, she served as the president of her local American Legion Post. In 2006, she was elected to the Wicomico County Council in District 1, becoming the first African-American woman to serve on the county council. She also served as a member of the Maryland Commission on Correctional Standards from 2010 to 2014.

In 2014, she was encouraged by incumbent state delegate Rudolph C. Cane to run for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 37A, succeeding him as his health declined. She ran unopposed in the primary and general elections after Cane withdrew his candidacy. Sample-Hughes was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 14, 2015.

She was the speaker pro tempore of the Maryland House of Delegates from 2019 to 2024. During her tenure, she served on several committees and held various positions, including Member of the Judiciary Committee, Member of the Joint Committee on Behavioral Health and Opioid Use Disorders, Speaker Pro Tem, Member of the Legislative Policy Committee, and House Chair of the Joint Legislative Committee to Select the State Treasurer.
