Nino Mangione is an American politician from the Republican Party who is a member of the Maryland House of Delegates. He has been representing District 42A since 2023, and prior to that, he represented District 42B from 2019 to 2023. He also served as a Baltimore County co-chair for the state's Trump Victory Leadership County team.

Born Antonio Mangione on April 1, 1987, in Baltimore County, Maryland, U.S., he is a lifelong resident of Baltimore County. Coming from a large Italian family, he grew up the second of six children and one of 60 grandchildren. His love of country and community began at a young age, listening to his grandfather retell, with pride, his World War II stories.

Nino attended Calvert Hall High School where he became a varsity soccer captain and champion. He then attended Towson University on a soccer scholarship where he once again earned the title of team captain. There he earned a degree in political science, graduating cum laude as a scholar athlete. While at Towson, Nino became the President of the Towson University Republican Club.

After graduating, Nino took an internship at WCBM radio and was hired by Calvert High School to coach in their soccer program. Nino took a full-time position with WCBM where he has been a voice for the people of Baltimore County, live on air for more than a decade. Nino’s experience at WCBM includes guest hosting, managing the external communications of the station and offering commentary on the relevant issues of the day.

Prior to entering elective politics, Nino had the opportunity to interview a variety of people including some of America’s top law enforcement officials and a 4-star United States General. He was able to ride along the U.S./Mexico border with Board Patrol Agents, he has met with the father of a 9/11 victim, and mothers of sons killed by illegal immigrants. These experiences shaped and solidified Nino’s beliefs leading him to pursue elective office.

Nino was always active in the local political scene through grassroots efforts, testifying and monitoring bill hearings, volunteering on Republican campaigns and engaging in conservative politics. The retirement of a Maryland Delegate in 2018 opened the door for Nino to run for public office as a young man. He won a strong victory in the Republican primary, significantly out-polling his competitors. He went on to win a convincing victory in the general election over well-funded Democrat opponents.

Voters rewarded Nino’s work with an overwhelming victory in his re-election campaign in 2022 and he continues his service as Maryland’s conservative champion representing District 42A in the Maryland House of Delegates. Nino was sworn in as a freshman legislator in 2019 and was rewarded with a seat on the Appropriations Committee. He was also appointed to the Health & Social Services subcommittee and the Oversight Committee on pensions. Nino has been a tireless advocate for prudent spending, strong fiscal management and protecting taxpayers. Nino is known in the House of Delegates for unwavering support of law enforcement, advocacy of parental rights in education and the protection of Maryland taxpayers.
