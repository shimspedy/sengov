Dylan Andrew Behler, born on June 5, 1998, in Annapolis, Maryland, is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing district 30A since February 6, 2025. A dedicated member of the Democratic Party, Behler's journey in politics began long before his appointment to the House of Delegates.

Behler grew up in Anne Arundel County and graduated from Southern High School in 2016. He then attended the University of Maryland, College Park, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and government in 2020. During his time at university, Behler gained valuable experience as a government affairs intern for the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department in 2017.

In 2018, Behler worked on the campaigns of Alice J. Cain and Steuart Pittman, further solidifying his commitment to public service. He also served as a committee analyst for Senate President Thomas V. Miller Jr. and later as legislative director and chief of staff for state senator Sarah Elfreth from 2019 to 2023. His dedication to the Democratic Party was evident through his service as a member of the Anne Arundel Democratic Central Committee from 2019 to 2025 and as a delegate to the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

Before his appointment to the Maryland House of Delegates, Behler worked as the director of legislative and constituent services for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. His extensive experience in various political roles prepared him well for his current position.

In January 2025, after state delegate Shaneka Henson was appointed to the Maryland Senate, Behler applied to fill the remainder of her term in the House of Delegates. He was nominated to the seat by the Anne Arundel Democratic Central Committee on February 1, 2025, and was sworn in on February 6, 2025. At 26 years old, Behler became the youngest member of the Maryland General Assembly.

Throughout his career, Behler has been actively involved in various committees and organizations. He is a member of the Environment and Transportation Committee, serving on both the Environment Subcommittee and the Land Use and Ethics Subcommittee. Additionally, he has been a board member of the Anne Arundel County Public Library since 2024 and has held leadership positions in the Sierra Club's Anne Arundel County Group and the Anne Arundel County Young Democrats.

Behler's dedication to public service and his commitment to the Democratic Party have made him a prominent figure in Maryland politics. As he continues to serve in the House of Delegates, Behler remains focused on addressing the needs of his constituents and working towards a better future for all Marylanders.
