Pamela Graboski Beidle was born on July 21, 1951, in Baltimore, Maryland. She graduated from Archbishop Spalding High School and later attended Anne Arundel Community College, earning her associate degree in business in 1977. She furthered her education at Towson University, where she earned her Bachelor of Science degree magna cum laude in business administration in 1994.

After graduating from Anne Arundel Community College, Beidle started her own insurance company, Beidle Insurance Agency, which she ran with her husband until 2017. She was also a member of the Northern Anne Arundel Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Life Underwriters, and served on the boards of Leadership Anne Arundel and Hospice of the Chesapeake.

In 1998, Beidle won election to the Anne Arundel County Council in District 1, succeeding term-limited councilmember George F. Bachman Jr. She was sworn in December 1998, and served until December 4, 2006.

Beidle was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 10, 2007. She was a member of the Environmental Matters Committee (later renamed to the Environment and Transportation Committee) during her entire tenure. In August 2017, Beidle filed to run for the Maryland Senate in District 32 in 2018, seeking to succeed retiring state senator James E. DeGrange Sr., who had encouraged her to run.

After running unopposed in the primary election, Beidle faced Republican county councilmember John Grasso in the general election, whom she defeated with 66.4 percent of the vote. She has served as a member of the Maryland Senate from District 32 since 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, she previously represented the district in the Maryland House of Delegates from 2007 to 2019, and was a member of the Anne Arundel County Council from 1998 to 2006.

She serves on the Finance Committee and is the Chair of the Executive Nominations Committee. She is also a member of several other committees and caucuses, including the Maryland Veterans Caucus, Women Legislators of Maryland, Maryland Legislative Latino Caucus, and the Maryland Legislative Jewish Caucus.
