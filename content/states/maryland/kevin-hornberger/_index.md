Kevin Bailey Hornberger was born on June 26, 1981, in North East, Maryland. He graduated from Rising Sun High School in 1999 and attended Cecil College, where he earned an associate degree in general studies in 2003. He then attended the University of Maryland from 2003 to 2004, and later graduated with honors from the University of the District of Columbia with a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 2010.

After graduating, Hornberger founded his own company, Blue Collar Engineering Inc., and began working as a facility manager for the Library of Congress. In 2014, he ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 35A, challenging incumbent Democratic Delegate David D. Rudolph, who was drawn into the district following redistricting in 2012. He won the Republican primary with a 300-vote lead over his opponent. During the general election, he was endorsed by Republican gubernatorial nominee Larry Hogan and U.S. Representative Andy Harris. He defeated Rudolph in the general election with 56.5 percent of the vote.

Hornberger was sworn in as a member of the House of Delegates on January 14, 2015. Since 2020, he has served as the Deputy Minority Whip. He has been a member of several committees, including the Ways and Means Committee, the Joint Committee on Gaming Oversight, the Maryland Legislative Sportsmen's Caucus, the Maryland Veterans Caucus, and the Maryland Legislative Transit Caucus.

Hornberger was married to his wife, Danielle, who currently serves as the county executive of Cecil County. Together, they had one child.
