Early Life and Education:
Emily was born in Fairfax, Virginia to immigrant parents and was raised by a single mother who was a small business owner. She began serving her community at age nine and received the local United Way’s “Community Hero” award in 2001 for her service to numerous local charities including Big Brothers, Big Sisters; the Arc of High Point (NC); the local public library; Habitat for Humanity; and several others. Emily earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Duke University in 2005, attended the Columbus School of Law, and earned her J.D. degree from the Catholic University of America in 2008. She was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 2009.

Political Career:
After graduating from Catholic University, Emily worked for U.S. Representative Edolphus Towns until 2012, first as a legislative assistant and then as his legislative director. From 2012 to 2014, she worked as the senior director of legislative affairs with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, afterwards working as a consultant for lobbyist groups Stanton Park Group and Horizon Government Affairs.

In 2014, she unsuccessfully ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 18, receiving 11 percent of the vote behind incumbents Ana Sol Gutierrez, Jeff Waldstreicher, and Al Carr. Emily ran again in 2018 after Waldstreicher announced he would run for the Maryland Senate, winning the Democratic primary with 19.7 percent of the vote and defeating Republican challenger Linda Willard in the general election with 30 percent of the vote.
