William Joseph Wivell was born on June 9, 1964, in Hagerstown, Maryland. He attended Smithsburg High School in Smithsburg, Maryland, and graduated from Hagerstown Community College with an A.A. degree in 1984. He later graduated from Shepherd University with a B.A. in 1986, and from Mount Saint Mary's University with an M.B.A. in 1991.

Wivell currently works as a business administrator at the St. James School. In 1998, Wivell was elected to the Washington County Board of County Commissioners, where he served until he retired in 2010 to "take a break from public life to focus on other things". In 2008, he applied to fill a vacancy in the Maryland House of Delegates following the resignation of Robert A. McKee.

Wivell was re-elected to the Board of County Commissioners in 2014, where he served until Governor Larry Hogan appointed him to serve in the Maryland House of Delegates in February 2015, filling a vacancy left by the resignation of delegate Andrew A. Serafini to serve in the Maryland Senate. Wivell is an endowment life member of the National Rifle Association.

Wivell was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on March 16, 2015. He was a member of the Appropriations Committee from 2015 to 2016, afterwards serving on the Environment and Transportation Committee until 2022. Since 2023, Wivell has served on the Economic Matters Committee.

In January 2020, Wivell was named as the co-chairman of the Washington County Trump Leadership team. In August 2020, following the resignation of state Senator Andrew A. Serafini, Wivell applied to fill the vacancy he left in the Maryland Senate. The Washington County Republican Central Committee and Governor Larry Hogan would end up nominating delegate Paul D. Corderman to fill the vacancy.

In October 2021, Wivell was one of five Maryland state legislators from Garrett, Allegany, and Washington counties who sent a pair of letters to West Virginia officials asking about annexation of Western Maryland to West Virginia.
