Paul D. Corderman, born on September 1, 1977, is an American politician from Maryland and a member of the Republican Party. He was born and raised in Hagerstown, Maryland, in the same neighborhood where he resides today. He grew up living on the very same street where he used to ride his bike early in the morning to deliver newspapers.

Corderman graduated from North Hagerstown High School in 1995 and later attended the University of Maryland, College Park, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in criminal justice in 2000. After graduation, he worked as a Repair Coordinator at Progressive Insurance from 2003 to 2013 and then as a Shop Manager at Mace Auto Body in Smithsburg, Maryland, from 2013 to 2019.

His political career began following the death of his father in July 2012. His father, John P. Corderman, was a member of the Maryland Senate and a circuit court judge. In 2016, Corderman ran for the Hagerstown City Council on a platform of increasing grants and tax incentives and cutting regulations. He was sworn into the Hagerstown City Council on November 29, 2016, and served until December 19, 2017.

In November 2017, following Governor Larry Hogan's appointment of state delegate Brett Wilson to the Washington County Circuit Court, Corderman applied to serve the remainder of Wilson's term in the Maryland House of Delegates. The Washington County Republican Central Committee nominated Corderman to fill the seat, and Hogan appointed Corderman to the Maryland House of Delegates in December 2017. He was sworn in on December 20, 2017, and was elected to a full four-year term in 2018.

In August 2020, following the resignation of state senator Andrew A. Serafini, Corderman applied to serve the remainder of Serafini's term in the Maryland Senate. The Washington County Republican Central Committee nominated Corderman to fill the vacancy, and Hogan appointed him to the Maryland Senate the following day. He was sworn into the Maryland Senate on September 1, 2020.

Corderman is passionate about and committed to helping Washington County identify and make the most of the opportunities that are ahead. He believes in the future of Washington County and truly feels that together, they're better. He lives in Hagerstown with his wife, Kerri, and daughter, Samantha, and their Golden Retriever, Chewie.
