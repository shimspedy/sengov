Andrew Christopher Pruski was born on November 11, 1978, in Batavia, New York. He graduated from Niagara University, earning his Bachelor of Arts in history in 2000 and his Master of Science in secondary education in 2001. Shortly after graduating, Pruski became a social studies teacher at Frederick Douglass High School.

In October 2003, he participated in a school employees protest at the Prince George's County Public Schools headquarters over stalled contract negotiations and persistent payroll errors. Although the school board reached a contract with the teacher's union in December, Pruski expressed discontent with the deal, saying "There are a lot of issues on the table we need to discuss. It's not just the contract."

Pruski later worked as an assessment supervisor for Baltimore County Public Schools from 2005 to 2014, and for Prince George's County Public Schools since 2014. Pruski entered politics in 2006, running unsuccessfully for the Anne Arundel County Council and losing to Jamie Benoit in the Democratic primary. In the same year, he was appointed to the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals, where he served until 2009, when he was appointed to the Anne Arundel County Board of Education by Governor Martin O'Malley.

In August 2013, Pruski announced that he would again run for the Anne Arundel County Council in District 4. Pruski narrowly won the Democratic primary on June 24, 2014, edging out his opponent by 151 votes. Afterwards, Pruski resigned from the Anne Arundel County Board of Education, complying with a state law that prohibits candidates from appearing on a general election ballot for more than one paid position. Pruski won the general election on November 4, defeating Republican challenger Chike Anyanwu with 57.5 percent of the vote.

He is a member of the Maryland House of Delegates for District 33A in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He was previously a member of the Anne Arundel County Council from 2014 to 2022, serving as its chair from 2018 to 2019 and its vice-chair from 2021 to 2022.
