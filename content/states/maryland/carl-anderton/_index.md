Carl Anderton, Jr. is a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 38B. He assumed office on January 14, 2015. His current term ends on January 13, 2027. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Born in Maryland on May 20, 1973, Anderton has a long history of public service. He served as the Delmar Mayor, Commissioner, and Planning and Zoning Chairman. During his tenure, he worked with the Mayor of Delmar, Delaware, to oversee the purchase and major rehabilitation of the vacant Bank of Delmar building. This project turned a vacant eyesore into the new Delmar Town Hall. The former town hall was expanded significantly and became the new Delmar Police Department.

Anderton also worked on the Walnut Street project, which addressed frequent flooding, added sidewalks and street parking in some sections, and rehabilitated water, stormwater, and sewer infrastructure. The project began by seeking public input on design and was followed by frequent meetings to discuss progress.

His intergovernmental experience included collaborating with Sussex County, Wicomico County, and legislatures and governors of Delaware and Maryland. He served as the President of the Eastern Shore Association of Municipalities and the D-1 Vice President. As President, he coordinated meetings throughout the Eastern Shore to hear from municipal leaders regarding legislation pending in Annapolis. As District One Vice President, he informed the Maryland Municipal League Board about Lower Shore issues to be addressed at the state level.

Anderton was elected unanimously by 156 other mayors from across the state as the President of the Maryland Municipal League (MML), a sister organization of the Maryland Association of Counties (MACo). He was the first MML president from a Wicomico County municipality other than Salisbury and the fourth MML President from Wicomico County. He advocated successfully with the Oâ€™Malley administration to lay the groundwork to restore Highway User Revenues to counties and municipalities through the temporary grant program.
