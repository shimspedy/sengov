Samuel Isadore "Sandy" Rosenberg was born on May 18, 1950, in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S. He is a member of the Democratic party. He grew up in the city's Cross Country neighborhood, where he was a member of the Har Sinai Congregation. He attended Baltimore City College and graduated from Amherst College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1972. He earned his Juris Doctor degree from Columbia University in 1975.

While attending Columbia University, Rosenberg worked as an intern for the Baltimore state's attorney's office. He resigned from this position in July 1974 to run for the Democratic Central Central Committee in the 42nd district, but continued working as an unpaid volunteer in the same position to avoid violating the Hatch Act. Rosenberg was elected to the Baltimore City Democratic Central Committee in September 1974.

From 1975 to 1976, and again from 1979 to 1981, he worked as a program administrator for the Baltimore Housing Authority, in between working as a producer and assistant for WJZ-TV 's Square Off talk show. Afterwards, Rosenberg worked as a congressional assistant and as a lobbyist for Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer in the Maryland General Assembly from 1980 to 1981. He later taught a class in legislation at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.

In 1982, Rosenberg ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 42. He won the Democratic primary in September, placing third and defeating incumbent state Delegates Steven V. Sklar and David B. Shapiro. Rosenberg was sworn in on January 12, 1983. In 2002, he was redrawn into the 41st district, where he successfully ran for re-election.

During his first twenty years in the House of Delegates, Rosenberg served as a member of the Appropriations Committee, afterwards serving in the Health and Government Operations Committee until 2004. He is currently the longest serving member of the Maryland General Assembly.

Rosenberg has been a member of the House for Delegates since 1983 and currently serves as chair of the Subcommittee on Government Operations and House chair of the Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive, and Legislative Review.
