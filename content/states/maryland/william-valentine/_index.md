William M. Valentine, born in 1971 or 1972, is an American politician. He was born in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Valentine earned an A.A. in criminal justice from Frederick Community College in 1991.

He is a member for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 2A in Washington and Frederick counties. He was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in November 2022 and has been a member of the House of Delegates since January 11, 2023. He currently serves as the Deputy Minority Whip.

Before his political career, Valentine was a retired police officer. He worked as a police officer in Thurmont, Maryland from 1994 to 1998, and again from 2003 to 2005. In between, he worked as a deputy sheriff in Garrett County, Maryland, and retired as a lieutenant in the Westminster Police Department in 2019. Prior to serving in the legislature, he worked as an investigator with the Frederick County State's Attorney's office.

In 2022, Valentine ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 4, seeking to succeed outgoing state Delegate Dan Cox, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2022. He was later redrawn into District 2A. He won the Republican primary election with 22.9 percent of the vote, placing second behind incumbent state delegate William J. Wivell. He faced no formal opposition in the general election.

In the legislature, Valentine was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 11, 2023. He is a member of the House Judiciary Committee.

During his 2022 House of Delegates campaign, Valentine ran on a platform that included advocating for limited state government, supporting law enforcement, limiting taxes, preserving natural resources, and defending the Second Amendment. He also supports tougher sentences for violent criminals and people who commit handgun violations.
