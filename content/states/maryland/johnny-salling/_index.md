Johnny Ray Salling

Johnny Ray Salling, born on October 31, 1961, is an American politician from the Republican Party. He is currently serving as a Maryland State Senator representing District 6, which covers southeast Baltimore County, including Dundalk, Essex, and Rosedale.

Early Life and Career

Salling was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated from Sparrows Point High School. In 1979, he joined the United States Army, serving as a combat engineer until 1981. Upon his return to the United States, he worked as a steel worker for LaFarge of North America at the Bethlehem Steel Mill in Sparrows Point, Maryland for more than 30 years. He gained experience as a union representative for the United Steelworkers of America union.

Political Career

In September 2013, Salling filed to run for Maryland Senate, seeking to succeed Democratic state senator Norman Stone, who had announced his retirement from the General Assembly. The closing of the Sparrows Point mill in 2012 moved him to run for public office. Despite Stone endorsing his challenger, state delegate Johnny Olszewski, during the general election, Salling defeated Olszewski in the general election, garnering 47.9 percent of the vote compared to Olszewski's 44.7 percent.

Salling was sworn into the Maryland Senate on January 14, 2015. He was a member of the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee from 2015 to 2019, afterwards serving as a member of the Budget and Taxation Committee. In April 2017, Salling joined the Reform on Tap task force, which was led by Comptroller Peter Franchot and sought to reform the state's regulations on the production and distribution of beer in the state.

In August 2019, Salling announced his candidacy for Maryland's 2nd congressional district in the 2020 elections, seeking to take on incumbent Democrat Dutch Ruppersberger.

Personal Life

Salling is a member of Moose Lodge no. 1228, Dundalk. He is a Deacon at Calvary Baptist Church of Dundalk. He has five children and two grandchildren.
