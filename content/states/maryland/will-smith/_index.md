He attended The Barrie School in Silver Spring, Maryland, and later went on to attend the College of William and Mary, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in government in 2004 and his Juris Doctor degree in 2009. He also attended Johns Hopkins University, earning a Master of Arts degree in government in 2006, and National Intelligence University, earning a Master of Science of Strategic Intelligence degree in 2018.

Smith enlisted in the military following the September 11 attacks. He was deployed to Afghanistan with the 1st Armored Division as part of Operation Resolute Support from March to October 2019, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve. While deployed, Smith assisted with the country's 2019 presidential election and monitored peace talks between the Taliban and the United States in Doha, Qatar.

In 2005, Smith started Youth Achieve Inc., a youth development nonprofit. As of 2023, he currently serves on the board of directors of multiple organizations, including Gandhi Brigade, the GapBuster Learning Center, and Impact Silver Spring.
