Bryan Warner Simonaire was born on September 6, 1963, in Baltimore, Maryland. He is an American politician who serves as a Maryland state senator representing District 31, which encompasses much of northern Anne Arundel County's Baltimore suburbs. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the minority leader of the Maryland Senate from 2020 to 2023.

Simonaire graduated from Bob Jones University in 1985, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science, and from Loyola College, where he earned a Master of Science degree in engineering in 2005. He is a member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon. After graduating from Bob Jones, Simonaire has worked as a computer systems engineer for Westinghouse Electronic Systems (now Northrop Grumman since its acquisition in 1995). In 2002, he founded Heroes-at-Home, a web-based program that helps the needy.

Simonaire became involved in politics in 2005, when he joined the North Count Republican Club's board of directors. He entered the race for state Senate in District 31 later that year, seeking to succeed retiring Democratic state senator Philip C. Jimeno and running on a "common sense, conservative" platform that included opposition to same-sex marriage. The district was targeted by the Maryland Republican Party, which saw the election as an opportunity to make legislative gains. Simonaire won the Republican primary in September 2006, and later won the general election on November 7, 2006, defeating Democratic state delegate Walter J. Shandrowsky by 659 votes, or a margin of 1.72 percent. It was the closest election in the 2006 Maryland Senate elections.

Simonaire was sworn into the Maryland Senate on January 10, 2007. He was initially a member of the Judicial Proceedings Committee from 2007 to 2010, afterwards serving on the Health and Environmental Affairs Committee until 2022. Since 2023, he has served on the Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee.
