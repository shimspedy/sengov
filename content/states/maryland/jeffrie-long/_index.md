Jeffrie Eugene Long Jr. was born on November 12, 1996. He is an American politician and a member of the Maryland House of Delegates for District 27B in Calvert and Prince George's counties in Maryland.

Long graduated from Huntingtown High School and later attended Liberty University, where he earned a Bachelors of Arts degree in clinical psychology. He is currently the pastor at Communion Church in Huntingtown, Maryland.

Long previously served as a legislative aide to then-President of the Maryland Senate Thomas V. Miller Jr. and state senators Joanne C. Benson and Michael Jackson. In 2020, Long was elected as a Democratic National Convention delegate, pledged to Joe Biden, with 19.5 percent of the vote.

In February 2021, Long applied to fill a vacancy in the Maryland House of Delegates left by the appointment of state delegate Michael Jackson to the Maryland Senate. The Prince George's County Democratic Committee nominated Jacqueline Steele-McCall to fill the vacancy, but the Calvert County Democratic Central Committee picked Rachel Jones to fill the vacancy. Jones was ultimately appointed to the seat by Governor Larry Hogan on February 17, 2021.

Long challenged Jones' incumbency in the 2022 Maryland House of Delegates election, defeating her in the Democratic primary with 54.3 percent of the vote. He faced no opposition in the general election. Long was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 11, 2023. He and Joe Vogel are the first Gen-Z members of the Maryland General Assembly. He is a member of the House Environment and Transportation Committee.

Long has described himself as a "fiscal conservative". During his House of Delegates candidacy, Long campaigned on topics such as women's rights, making schools safer, fixing the state's transportation system, and making Maryland more retiree-friendly.

Long lives in Brandywine, Maryland. In April 2023, Long was charged with home invasion and first-degree felony assault after allegedly breaking into his aunt's Huntingtown home and threatening her with a pipe. His attorneys denied the charges, arguing that Long was not in the area when it occurred and that the charges were the result of an undisclosed family matter. If convicted, Long faced a maximum of 25 years in prison for each charge. In May 2023, both charges were downgraded before trial to misdemeanors, second-degree assault and fourth-degree burglary.
