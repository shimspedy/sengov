Kevin M. Harris was born on October 24, 1981, in Newark, New Jersey. He served in the United States Navy from 1999 to 2009. After his service, he pursued his education and graduated from Washington Bible College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in general studies in 2011. He furthered his education at Walden University, where he earned a Master of Science degree in leadership development in 2014.

In his early political career, Harris ran for the Prince George's County Council in District 9 in 2018. Despite his efforts, he came in third-to-last-place in the Democratic primary, receiving only 4.8 percent of the vote.

Undeterred by this setback, Harris ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 27A in 2022. He challenged the incumbent, Susie Proctor, and emerged victorious in the Democratic primary with 55.9 percent of the vote. He was unopposed in the general election and was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 11, 2023.

As a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, Harris represents District 27A, which includes parts of Charles and Prince George's County. He is a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

In addition to his political career, Harris has worked at Fort Meade since 2011. His military service is decorated with several awards, including the Joint Service Commendation Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.
