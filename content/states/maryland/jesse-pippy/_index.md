Jesse Tyler Pippy was born on August 6, 1982. He grew up in a military family, living in various parts of the world including Europe and Asia. His family's roots in Frederick County, Maryland go back to the 1700s.

Pippy attended Christopher Newport University, where he earned a B.A. degree in political science. He then went on to earn a J.D. degree at the University of Maryland School of Law. His involvement with politics began in 2014 when he ran for the Maryland Senate in District 12, although he was unsuccessful in this endeavor.
