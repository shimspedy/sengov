Kathy Szeliga was born on October 10, 1961, in Baltimore, Maryland. She comes from a military family, with her father being a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army. Kathy married her husband in 1980, and they initially struggled financially. During this time, she worked various jobs including as a dishwasher, a maid, and a housekeeper.

In her 30s, Kathy decided to pursue higher education and enrolled at Towson State University. She graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in elementary education. After graduation, she began working as a teacher in Baltimore City Public Schools. Alongside her teaching career, Kathy and her husband started a construction business.

Kathy's political journey began in the mid-1990s when she organized opposition against the Maryland School Performance and Assessment Program, a controversial test used to assess schools. She became involved with state politics after a family friend, James M. Kelly, was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates. Kathy worked as a legislative aide to Kelly, then for Delegate John G. Trueschler, and eventually became chief of staff for then-State Senator Andy Harris.

She decided to run for Delegate after Del. J. B. Jennings decided to run for the State Senate. Kathy was elected and immediately placed on the Appropriations Committee. She was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 11, 2011. From 2013 to 2021, she served as the House Minority Whip, making her the highest-ranking elected Republican woman in Maryland.

In 2016, Kathy was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in Maryland to replace retiring Senator Barbara Mikulski. However, she was defeated by Democrat, Chris Van Hollen.

Throughout her political career, Kathy has served on various committees including the Health and Government Operations Committee, Rules and Executive Nominations Committee, and the Environment and Transportation Committee. She has also been a part of the Legislative Policy Committee, Marijuana Legalization Work Group, Work Group to Address Police Reform and Accountability in Maryland, and the Joint Covid-19 Response Legislative Work Group.

Kathy Szeliga continues to serve as a Republican member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 7A. She is a dedicated public servant, a successful businesswoman, and an advocate for education and small businesses.
