Nicholas Patrick Charles II, known as Nick Charles, was born on December 16, 1982, in Washington, D.C. He grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland, and graduated from Largo High School.

Charles served in the 60th Fighter Squadron and the 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron of the U.S. Air Force from 2001 to 2006. After his military service, he attended the Community College of the Air Force, where he earned an associate degree in aviation management. He also attended the University of the District of Columbia, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration, both in 2009.

After serving in the military, Charles worked as a defense contractor for the U.S. Navy. In 2015, he started his own consulting company. In 2014, Charles unsuccessfully ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 25, placing fifth in the Democratic primary. He ran again in 2018, during which he ran on a slate with incumbents Dereck E. Davis and Darryl Barnes. Charles placed third in the Democratic primary and general elections.

Charles was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019. He served as a member of the Health and Government Operations Committee until 2021, afterwards serving in the Ways and Means Committee. Following the appointment of Erek Barron to serve as U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, Charles was unanimously elected as the chair of the Prince George's County Delegation.

In October 2023, after state senator Melony G. Griffith announced that she would resign at the end of the month, Charles announced that he would apply to serve the remainder of Griffith's term in the Maryland Senate. He was appointed to the Maryland State Senate on December 5, 2023, after having served 5 years in the Maryland House of Delegates, replacing former Senator Melony Griffith.

Charles has served as a member of the Maryland Senate representing District 25 since 2023. He previously represented the district in the Maryland House of Delegates from 2019 to 2023.
