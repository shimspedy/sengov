Charles J. Otto was born on February 15, 1964, in Salisbury, Maryland. He completed his high school education at Washington High School. After high school, he attended the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and later graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science in 1986.

Otto is not just a politician but also a corn and soybean farmer. His connection to the land and his academic background in Animal Science provide him with a unique perspective on agricultural and environmental issues, which are often key topics in political discussions within the state of Maryland.

In terms of his political career, Otto is a member of the Republican Party. He ran for re-election to the Maryland House of Delegates to represent District 38A and won in the general election held on November 8, 2022.

The Maryland House of Delegates, where Otto serves, is the lower chamber of the Maryland General Assembly. Alongside the Maryland State Senate, it forms the legislative branch of the Maryland state government and works alongside the governor of Maryland to create laws and establish a state budget. The House of Delegates meets in the State House in Annapolis, Maryland.

The Maryland House of Delegates has a rich history dating back to the 17th Century. What today is the House of Delegates began as the Lower House of the General Assembly in 1650, when the legislature became a bicameral body. The Lower House continually fought for more power by asserting exclusive rights in certain legislative areas, such as levying taxes and originating money bills.

As a delegate, Otto is part of this historical institution, contributing to the creation of laws, setting levels for state spending, raising and lowering taxes, and voting to uphold or override gubernatorial vetoes. His work impacts not only his constituents in District 38A but also the broader population of Maryland.
