Carl W. Jackson was born on October 27, 1984, in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Overlea High School in Baltimore County, Maryland. He furthered his education at Strayer University in Washington, D.C., where he earned a B.S. degree in business administration in 2008 and an M.B.A degree in 2017.

Before his political career, Jackson worked as an administrative analyst for the University of Maryland School of Social Work and served as a member of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County Staff Senate from 2014 to 2019. He was called to politics by President Barack Obama's exhortation at the end of his second term that young people interested in making a change should run for office.

In 2018, Jackson ran for the Maryland House of Delegates for the 8th Legislative District. He won the primary but fell short by 570 votes in the General Election. Despite the setback, Jackson remained active in public service. He co-chaired the public safety workgroup for Baltimore County executive-elect Johnny Olszewski's transition team in December 2018 and joined the Baltimore County Pedestrian and Bicycle Committee.

In 2019, following the resignation of state delegate Eric M. Bromwell, Jackson applied to fill his vacancy. His candidacy was endorsed by several notable figures, including Olszewski, state senator Kathy Klausmeier, Bromwell, state delegate Harry Bhandari, and county councilwoman Cathy Bevins. In October 2019, Governor Larry Hogan appointed Jackson to the House of Delegates following the recommendations of the Baltimore County Democratic Central Committee.

Jackson was sworn in on October 21, 2019, to fill a vacancy in District 8 of the Maryland House of Delegates. He is the first African-American legislator to represent the district. He was assigned to the House Economics Matters Committee and is a member of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and the Legislative Transit Caucus.
