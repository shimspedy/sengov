Mary Angela Lehman, born on April 8, 1964, in Cheverly, Maryland, is an American politician from the Democratic Party. She is a current member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing District 21.

Lehman grew up in Greenbelt, Maryland, and attended the University of Maryland, where in 1987 she received her Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and Bachelor of Science in Journalism. From 1993 to 1994, Lehman worked as a spokesperson for Citizens Against the Stadium II, a group that protested the construction of the FedExField football stadium in Laurel, Maryland.

In 2003, Lehman began working as an educational liaison to Prince George's County council member Tom Dernoga. In 2007, she began working for delegate Joseline Pe√±a-Melnyk, who encouraged her to run for public office. From 2010 to 2018, Lehman served on the Prince George's County Council, succeeding Tom Dernoga, who was term-limited.

As a councilwoman, she oversaw the opening of the Prince George's Laurel Library Branch and lobbied for the library to have solar panels, pervious parking surfaces, electric car chargers, low flow toilets and sinks, and emergency lighting. She also had a role in saving the University of Maryland Laurel Medical Center from closure.

In February 2018, Lehman, who was term limited from running for another term on the Prince George's County Council, announced her candidacy for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 21. She came in third place in the 2018 Democratic primary, defeating primary opponent Matt Dernoga by only 222 votes.

Lehman was sworn in as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019, and is a member of the Environment and Transportation Committee, the housing and real property subcommittee, and agriculture and open space subcommittee. Lehman is a member of the Maryland Legislative Transit Caucus and the Women Legislators of Maryland, and is an associate member of the Maryland Legislative Latino Caucus.
