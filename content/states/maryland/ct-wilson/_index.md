C. T. Wilson is an American politician and attorney who has represented District 28 in the Maryland House of Delegates since 2011. He is the first Black man elected delegate in Charles County. He served as the chair on the Business Regulations Subcommittee under the Economic Matters Committee. He is a member of the Southern Maryland Delegation and the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. He previously served as the House Chair of the Maryland Veterans Caucus.

Wilson was born on February 20, 1972, in Missouri. An orphan, he lived in several foster homes as a child. Wilson has stated he was sexually abused and repeatedly raped by his adoptive father, Tom Wilson, while in foster care from the ages of 9 to 15. He graduated from Freeburg Community High School in Freeburg, Illinois. After high school, at 18, he enlisted as a combat soldier in the U.S. Army from 1990 to 1997. He served in the Persian Gulf and Bosnia Herzegovina in both combat and medical units.

Wilson later graduated cum laude from Upper Iowa University with a B.A. in psychology. He then went on to the Howard University School of Law where he earned a J.D. in 2003, and was admitted to Maryland Bar. After graduating, he helped organize the Community Prosecution Unit of the Prince George's County State's Attorney's Office. He is a Maryland Foster Youth Resource Center boardmember and a National Eagle Scout Association member. He and his wife Nicole have three daughters.

In 2014, Wilson's book, 10,000 Hills: One Boy's Journey was published by CreateSpace. The book follows Wilson's early life story and the sexual abuse he faced from his adoptive father.

In December 2021, House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones appointed Wilson chairman of the House Economic Matters Committee, succeeding Delegate Dereck E. Davis.

During the 2021 legislative session, Wilson introduced legislation to require the Maryland State Board of Education to create statewide standards for teaching Black history to public school students. The bill was reintroduced during the 2022 legislative session. In 2022, Wilson opposed legislation to break up the College of Southern Maryland to create a new Charles County Community College.
