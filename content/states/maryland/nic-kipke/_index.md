Nicholaus Ryan Kipke, born on January 26, 1979, is an American politician. Since 2007, he has been serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing District 31. He also served as the Minority Leader of the Maryland House of Delegates from 2013 to 2021.

Kipke was born in Baltimore to father Ken Kipke. He graduated from Chesapeake High School and later attended Anne Arundel Community College. After attending school and college, Kipke worked as a restaurant manager for FriendCo Restaurants until 2000, when he became a manufacturer representative for REPS & Associates, Inc.

Kipke was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 10, 2007. He represented District 31 from 2007 to 2015 and since 2023, and District 31B from 2015 to 2023. In December 2008, following an unexpected drop in state revenues, Governor Martin O'Malley ordered a furlough for state employees. Kipke voluntarily participated in the state employee furlough later that month.

In May 2013, Kipke was elected Minority Leader, unseating Tony O'Donnell. He stepped down as minority leader in April 2021, saying that he would focus on upcoming elections in Anne Arundel County. Kipke chaired the exploratory committee for county councilor Jessica Haire's county executive campaign, later endorsing her candidacy in June 2021.

Kipke has been a member of the Health and Government Operations Committee since 2007. He has served in various subcommittees including the minority health disparities subcommittee, insurance subcommittee, government operations subcommittee, estates & trusts subcommittee, health facilities & occupations subcommittee, health facilities & pharmaceuticals subcommittee, health occupations & long-term care subcommittee, insurance & pharmaceuticals subcommittee, and government operations & health facilities subcommittee.

Kipke resides in Pasadena, Maryland, U.S. He was previously married to Morgan Uebersax and is currently married to Susannah Warner. They have three children.
