William G. Folden, born on April 5, 1972, is an American politician who is currently a Republican member of the Maryland Senate, representing District 4 since 2023. He was previously a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, representing District 3B from 2015 to 2019.

Folden was born in Hagerstown, Maryland, and graduated from nearby Governor Thomas Johnson High School. He later attended Frederick Community College, where he earned an A.A. degree in criminal justice. Folden also served in the United States Army in the military police corps and as a infantry sniper.

From 1994 to 2011, Folden served as the deputy sheriff of Frederick County, and has served as a police officer for the city of Frederick since 2011, even working as an officer while in the Maryland legislature.

In 2006, Folden announced his candidacy for Frederick County Sheriff, challenging incumbent Republican sheriff Chuck Jenkins. He was defeated by Jenkins in the Republican primary, coming in third with 21.16 percent of the vote.

In June 2021, Folden filed for the House of Delegates race in District 4. In September 2021, he withdrew his bid for delegate and entered the Senate race in District 4 for the seat being vacated by Michael Hough. He won the state senate election on November 8, 2022, by a margin of 57.54% to 42.36%.

Folden was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 14, 2015. He served in this position until January 9, 2019, after being defeated by Democratic challenger Ken Kerr in the 2018 Maryland House of Delegates election. He was the only active police officer in the state legislature.

Folden was sworn into the Maryland Senate on January 11, 2023. He has served on several committees and caucuses, including the Judiciary Committee, Environment and Transportation Committee, Public Safety and Policing Work Group, Maryland Legislative Sportsmen's Caucus, and Maryland Veterans Caucus.

Folden has also been involved in community service, serving as the president of the "Brunswick Junior Railroaders" Youth Football, Cheerleading and Lacrosse Organization since 2011.
