Lesley Jeanne Lopez was born on November 28, 1983. She is an American politician and who is a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from District 39. A member of the Democratic Party, she is currently a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Maryland's 6th congressional district, seeking to succeed outgoing U.S. Representative David Trone.

The oldest of three siblings, Lopez was born overseas while her mother Patricia was serving on active duty in the U.S. Navy. She grew up in Southern California in a blended family. As a child she was adopted by her stepfather, Emsley Lopez, also a naval officer. Her paternal grandparents migrated to the United States from the Philippines.

Lopez attended schools in San Bernardino, California. While in elementary school, she survived a school shooting in which a man from a neighboring apartment complex began shooting at her classmates. She later attended the University of California, San Diego, where she earned a B.A. in political science, and George Washington University, where she earned an M.P.A. in management.

After graduating, Lopez worked as a journalist for ABC News's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, BBC, CNN, America's Most Wanted, and the Eurovision Song Contest. She also worked as an adjunct professor of communications at George Washington University, where she became a member of Service Employees International Union Local 500.

Lopez first became involved with politics while working with immigrant families. She served as the press secretary for U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar from 2008 to 2011, afterwards serving as the communications director for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus until 2013. In this capacity, she helped pass the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act through the U.S. Senate and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which was expanded to include protections for undocumented immigrants.

Lopez later worked as the communications director for various other organizations, including the National Immigration Forum, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, and the US-China Business Council, from 2014 to 2017. Since 2017, she has worked as the chief communications director for Run for Something.

Lesley is proud of her big modern family and being a big sister to her siblings Samantha and Cole. As a member of Congress, she will fight for every family in every region of Marylandâ€™s 6th district.
