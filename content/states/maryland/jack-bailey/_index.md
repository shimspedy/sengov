John Daniel Bailey, known as Jack Bailey, was born on August 27, 1965, in Elkton, Maryland. He completed his high school education at St. Mary's Ryken High School in 1983. He further pursued his education at Johns Hopkins University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Management in 2013 and a Master of Science degree in Management in 2014.

Bailey's career began with the Maryland Natural Resources Police in 1991, where he served as a Natural Resources Police Officer until 2004. He then took on the role of Adjutant to the Superintendent/Legislative Liaison from 2005 to 2006. Following this, he served as the Executive Assistant to the Superintendent from 2005 to 2007. Bailey then became a Sergeant and the Covert Operations Unit Supervisor from 2007 to 2017.

In addition to his professional roles, Bailey has also been an active volunteer, dedicating many hours to youth-oriented sports teams and conservation organizations. He has coached on a ball field, taught hunter safety classes, and worked to raise funds for conservation organizations.

Bailey's political career began when he declared his candidacy for the Maryland Senate in March 2018. He sought a primary challenge to senator Stephen M. Waugh. During the primary, Governor Larry Hogan endorsed and financed Bailey's campaign. Bailey defeated Waugh in the primary by nearly 800 votes. He then defeated Democratic challenger Thomas Brewer in the general election with 60.2 percent of the vote.

Bailey was sworn into the Maryland Senate on January 9, 2019, representing the 29th district, based in Calvert County and St. Mary's County. He has been a vocal supporter and advocate for police and first responders in Maryland. As a member of the Judicial Proceedings Committee, he has spent countless hours advocating for Maryland’s first responder community.

Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Bailey has sponsored legislation to address specific needs in the Southern Maryland region. He has also been the Chair of the Maryland Legislative Sportsmen Caucus, coordinating with the Department of Natural Resources to allow straight-walled rifle cartridges for deer hunting, sponsoring legislation to allow Sunday hunting in St. Mary’s County, and advocating for Sunday hunting on private lands across the State of Maryland.

Bailey is married and has two children. He continues to serve the people of Maryland with dedication and commitment.
