Eric Douglas Ebersole, born on May 20, 1958, is an American politician who serves as a Delegate to the Maryland General Assembly representing District 44A. From 2015 to 2023, he represented the 12th District. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and grew up in Catonsville. He attended the University of Maryland, College Park, earning a B.S. degree in mathematics education in 1980 and an M.S. degree in the same field in 1986.

After graduating, Ebersole worked for more than three decades as a high school math teacher in Howard County, at Wilde Lake, Marriotts Ridge, and Reservoir High Schools. He also served as an adjunct instructor in mathematics education at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Among the awards Ebersole won during his time as a teacher was his selection as Outstanding Secondary Mathematics Teachers of the Year in 1987 by the Maryland Council of Teachers of Mathematics and his selection as Wilde Lake High School's Teacher of the Year in 2002.

In addition to his work as a classroom teacher, Ebersole was actively involved in a number of professional and community organizations. He was a member of the Maryland Council of Teachers of Mathematics and served in a number of leadership roles in that organization. In addition he volunteered with the Catonsville Chamber of Commerce, is a life member of the Catonsville Historical Society, and served in a number of leadership roles in the Catonsville Presbyterian Church.

Following redistricting in 2010, the three incumbent legislators representing District 12, which had formerly been divided into two sub-districts, chose not to run for re-election. Ebersole ran for the seat in a crowded primary field, and was elected alongside Terri Hill and Clarence Lam as an all-freshman delegation to the General Assembly.

Ebersole was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on January 14, 2015. Since 2022, he has served as Deputy Majority Whip. He has filed to run for re-election in 2022. In October 2015, Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates Michael E. Busch appointed Ebersole to a commission to study the use of standardized testing in the state's public schools.
