Sarah Siddiqui Wolek is an American politician and a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from District 16. She was born on November 6, 1979, in New York City and spent part of her childhood in Pakistan. Her family moved to Montgomery County, Maryland, so that her younger sibling could attend special education programs.

Wolek graduated from Thomas S. Wootton High School. She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and Bachelor of Science in information technology from the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). She later graduated from Columbia University with a Master of Business Administration degree and from the University of Chicago with a Master of Arts degree in public policy.

After graduating, Wolek worked for the federal government until shortly after the 2016 presidential election. She held positions in the United States Mission to the United Nations, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Office of Management and Budget, and the United States Department of the Treasury.

In 2017, Wolek returned to UMD to teach a career preparedness course. She also founded the Intentional Life Lab in February 2020, which hosted classes and workshops focusing on purpose and character, community, relationships, nature, prosperity, and wellness.

From 2018 to 2022, Wolek served as a member of the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee from District 16. In November 2018, she was named as a member of Montgomery County Executive-elect Marc Elrich's transition team. In December 2018, Wolek graduated from Emerge Maryland, a group dedicated to training and electing Democratic women to office.

In March 2023, Wolek was one of eighteen candidates to apply to fill a vacancy in the Maryland House of Delegates left by the appointment of then-delegate Ariana Kelly to the Maryland Senate. On March 21, the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee voted 16â€“8 to nominate her to serve the rest of Kelly's term.

Wolek was sworn into the Maryland House of Delegates on April 3, 2023. She is a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Wolek is the first Muslim woman to serve in the Maryland General Assembly.

Wolek is married and has three children. She currently resides in Bethesda, Maryland.
