Jake Hoffman is a prominent figure in Arizona politics, currently serving as a state senator in Arizona's 15th district. Before his tenure as a state senator, which began on January 9, 2023, he was a state representative in Arizona's 12th district. His political journey began when incumbent Republican Warren Petersen decided to run for the Arizona Senate, opening up a seat that Hoffman would eventually fill.

In the 2020 two-seat election, Hoffman and incumbent Travis Grantham both defeated Democrat Kristin Clark by over 85,000 votes. Beyond his political career, Hoffman is also a businessman, running a digital-marketing company called Rally Forge. However, the company was involved in a controversy when it was reported that Rally Forge formed a fake left-wing front group, America Progress Now, which promoted Green Party candidates online in 2018. This led to Rally Forge being banned from Facebook in 2020, and Hoffman himself was permanently suspended by Twitter.

Despite these controversies, Hoffman continued to be an active participant in Arizona politics. As of 2021, he served as the vice-chair of the Arizona House's Committee on Government and Elections. After Democratic candidate Joe Biden won the state of Arizona in the 2020 election, Hoffman declared himself an elector and attempted to submit documents to the National Archives and Records Administration saying that Arizona had been won by Republican candidate Donald Trump.

In 2022, Hoffman proposed to divide Maricopa County into three new counties, since 65% of the Arizonaâ€™s population is contained by that single county. Critics claimed that the proposal was intended to punish election officials in Maricopa County for not overturning the 2020 election results based on Trump's claims of fraud.

Hoffman is not just a politician, but also a Christian, husband, and father of 5. He was named the 2021 National Legislator of the Year and is a contributing columnist at Townhall.com. He is a fierce defender of the Constitution and is known for his conservative views.
