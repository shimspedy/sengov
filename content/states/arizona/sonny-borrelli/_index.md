Sonny Borrelli is an American politician and a Republican member of the Arizona Senate, representing the 30th district. He is currently serving as the Senate Majority Leader. Before this, Borrelli served in the Arizona House of Representatives as a representative of District 5, from January 14, 2013, to January 9, 2017.

Born in New York, U.S., Borrelli has had a long and varied career. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1977 to 1999, reaching the rank of gunnery sergeant. After his military service, Borrelli moved to Arizona in 2000. He was a member of the Lake Havasu City Council from 2010 to 2012.

In the Arizona House of Representatives, Borrelli was chair of the Military Affairs and Public Safety Committee. In the Senate, he has been chair of the Government Committee and Majority Whip.

Borrelli's political career includes several successful election campaigns. In 2012, he ran in the four-way August 28, 2012 Republican primary, placing second with 8,672 votes, and won the second seat in the November 6, 2012 general election. In 2014, Borrelli and Regina Cobb defeated Jennifer Jones, Sam Medrano and George Schnittgrund in the Republican primary. Borrelli and Cobb defeated Longoria and Weisser in the general election with Borrelli receiving 31,277 votes.

Following the 2020 United States presidential election, Borrelli supported the "Stop the Steal" movement which falsely claimed that Donald Trump won the election nationally and in Arizona.

In 2001, Borrelli was charged with "class 1 misdemeanor assault with domestic violence" after an altercation with his then-wife; he pleaded guilty to "class 1 misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge tagged with domestic violence", and served 1 day in prison. He subsequently explained that his then-wife had been experiencing a "meltdown" and "psychotic episode", that her injuries had been self-inflicted, and that he had plea-bargained because otherwise he risked losing custody of his son.
