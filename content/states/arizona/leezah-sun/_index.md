Leezah Sun is an American politician and activist, born around 1970 in Jeju City, South Korea to Chinese refugees. In 1977, when she was about 7 years old, her family immigrated to the United States and settled in Michigan.

Before entering politics, Sun worked in the pharmaceutical industry on the East Coast of the United States. She moved to Arizona in 2005 and started a family. For a time, she was a stay-at-home mom.

Sun's journey into activism and politics was sparked by a personal experience. Her 8-year-old son was denied access to gifted educational programs, which motivated her to volunteer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona and the Demand to Learn campaign.

She registered to vote in 2018 and ran in the 2020 Arizona House of Representatives election. Although she lost to two incumbents, she remained active in politics. After the election, she was appointed vice chair of the central region of the Arizona Asian American Pacific Islander Democratic Caucus.

In the 2022 Arizona House of Representatives election, Sun was elected to represent District 22 as a member of the Democratic Party. She assumed office on January 9, 2023. However, her tenure was cut short when she resigned from the Arizona House in January 2024 following the release of an ethics report. The report was part of a complaint filed by State House Democratic leaders, and investigators determined that Sun engaged in behavior that others deemed to be intimidating or threatening on various occasions.
