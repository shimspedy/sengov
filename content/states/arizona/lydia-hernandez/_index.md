In 2013, she signed the Center for Arizona Policy's "Pro-Life Proclamation" where she pledged to "make every effort to secure for preborn children at every stage of development all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to persons, citizens, and residents of this State, until the decisional interpretations of the United States Constitution by the United States Supreme Court provide protection for every human being."

In addition to her role in the House of Representatives, Hernandez served on the Financial Institutions and Government committees.
