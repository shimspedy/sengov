After winning election to Peoria's Acacia District on the City Council by a landslide in 2010, he quickly earned a reputation as an advocate for Fiscal Responsibility and Open Government. He led the crusade against wasteful spending, and tax increases.

He carried his conversative credentials to the Arizona Legislature and was elected by the voters 3 times. At the legislature Tony voted for balanced budgets, less government, and was a leader in cutting taxes. Fiscal responsibility will continue to be his top priority as a conservative at the legislature.

Rivero grew up in Peoria that is now part of District 27. He attended Peoria High School, Glendale Community College, and ASU where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Education and a Master's in Public Administration.

In addition to his formal education, Rivero is a business owner and an entrepreneur. Rivero's extensive knowledge of the district, thanks to his time as a member of the legislature, combined with his commitment to serve the voters of District 27, assists him in being an effective leader at the legislature.
