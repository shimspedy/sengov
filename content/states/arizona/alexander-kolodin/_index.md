Alexander Kolodin, or Alex Kolodin, is an American lawyer, politician, and a Republican member of the Arizona House of Representatives. He was elected to represent District 3 in 2022.

Personal Details:
- Nationality: American
- Political party: Republican

- Alma mater: Georgetown University, University of Pennsylvania

Early Life & Education:
Kolodin graduated from Georgetown University, prior to becoming an English and civics teacher. He then attended law school at the University of Pennsylvania. He was a Reagan Fellow at the Goldwater Institute, and also owned his own law practice. He is Jewish.

Political Career:
According to Kolodin's campaign website, he began litigating for election integrity in 2014. Before the 2020 election, Kolodin won a case against Adrian Fontes for sending out instructions that voters could cross out votes, an instruction Kolodin accused Fontes of being ripe to cause fraud. Kolodin came to prominence when he filed lawsuits to overturn the 2020 election. Kolodin was also part of the alternate elector plan, arguing in his August 2022 court filing to block the January 6th committee from accessing the phone records of the Republican Party chair, that "Trump electors simply created a backup plan in case legal challenges to Arizonaâ€™s outcome were successful." Kolodin represented the alternate electors as part of a broader effort to overturn the 2020 election in Congress. Kolodin reports on his campaign webpage, "The evidence collected during that trial was used by Congress to decide whether to accept the results of the election - and was a large reason why so many members of Congress objected to the results." Kolodin also represented the CyberNinjas audit team when the Democratic Party attempted to stop the audit.

In April 2023, Kolodin defended lawmaker Liz Harris, a QAnon adherant, who was expelled by the legislature for lying to the ethics committee, as part of a probe investigating Harris inviting a conspiracy theorist to present harmful and damaging information impugning the reputation of fellow legislative members and the LDS church. Kolodin later stated Harris made an error in judgment hosting the hearing which aired several conspiracy theories, but did not address fellow lawmakers' allegations that while before the Ethics Committee, Harris lied about her involvement during the public committee hearing.

In June 2023, Kolodin supported a bill to allow hand counting of votes, thus discouraging the use of voting machines. The same month, Kolodin unsuccessfully sued to end early voting in Arizona. Kolodin represented the group Clean Elections USA after they were involved in a lawsuit for violations of the Voting Rights Act.
