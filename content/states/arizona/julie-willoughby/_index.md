Julie Willoughby is an American politician and ER nurse from Chandler, Arizona. A Republican, she is a member of the Arizona House of Representatives and took office on May 5, 2023. Willoughby was appointed in May 2023 from the 13th legislative district, which includes much of Chandler, Arizona and all of Sun Lakes, Arizona.

Julie Willoughby is a Christian, wife, mother, Republican, and emergency room trauma nurse. In her role as an ER trauma nurse, Julie leverages her ability to remain quick and level-headed under intense pressure. This career also relies heavily on her creative problem solving and rational thinking skills - all of which serve her well in the House.

Despite the demands of her career and family, Julie donates time to her local church, and consistently gives back in the form of community service. In serving her community, Julie learned firsthand just how much government impacts our quality of life. She embraces that fact with her belief that “With a staunch commitment to my faith, my family and community I can make a positive impact on the future.”

Julie graduated from Arizona State University with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and holds multiple professional certifications that have enhanced her skills. In addition to being a trauma nurse and a person who consistently gives back to bolster her community, Julie is also honored to call herself a Christian, mother, wife and Republican.

Julie Willoughby is your State Representative from Legislative District 13 serving Chandler, Gilbert, and Sun Lakes. She is running for the legislature, to protect the future of her family and yours. Brice and Julie have no doubt that this is the path God had planned for them all along, and they couldn’t be more excited to enter this new chapter of public service.
