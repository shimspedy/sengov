Arizona Is My Home
I’m a fourth-generation Arizonan whose great-grandfather immigrated from Mexico to work in the copper mines in the Globe area. My father was in Air Force and became a real estate broker and business owner here in Phoenix, and I was blessed to be raised locally in the Arcadia area. I was a business owner of the largest sports medicine and weight training facility in the nation at one time, in Scottsdale, training NFL athletes and ASU football players among others. My experience in fitness turned into a national television program, “Get in Shape with Pamela Carter” which aired for 18 years on TBN. I also hosted various community television programs and worked with local charities and agencies and received my master’s degree in Communications and Biblical studies. I currently serve on the board of Help 4 Kidz, a great group that has received several Presidential awards for their work in reaching at-risk youth and families. Now, with my family’s full support, I am answering the call for State Legislature. I hope you will join our team!

My Mission
I am a compassionate and passionate leader who cares about the people of Arizona and their values and concerns. I am a fourth-generation Native Arizonan, my great-grandfather immigrated from Mexico to work in the copper mines in the Globe area.

My father was in the Airforce and became a real estate broker and business owner here in Phoenix, along with raising his family in the Arcadia district. I was a business owner in Scottsdale of the largest sports medicine and weight training facility in the nation at one time, training NFL athletes and ASU football players among other celebrities and public officials. My career took me to a national television program, “Get in Shape with Pamela Carter” which aired for 18 years on TBN and I hosted various community programs and promoted charities and agencies.
