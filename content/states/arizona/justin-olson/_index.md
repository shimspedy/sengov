I’m very excited to announce that I am running for the Arizona State House of Representatives in Legislative District 10! It will be an honor to once again represent East Mesa at our State Capitol. 


For anyone that lives in Legislative District 10, I would be very honored to have your support in this race. When I first ran for the Legislature, Arizona faced a $3.6B budget deficit and the record unemployment levels of the Great Recession. I ran promising to fight for fiscal responsibility and economic growth while championing the conservative policies across the board. In my six years at the Capitol, my successful legislation cut taxes, balanced the budget, eliminated job killing bureaucratic red tape, defunded Planned Parenthood and Obamacare in Arizona, expanded school choice, funded public safety, and much more.


I earned an A+ rating from the NRA and was recognized as a “Champion of the Taxpayer” by the Arizona Republican Party, a “Friend of the Family” by the Arizona Family Project, “Legislator of the Year” by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and “The Free Market Champion of the Year” by The Arizona Free Enterprise Club.


When I left the State Legislature, we had passed the first structurally balanced budget the state had seen in years and Forbes Magazine had ranked Arizona #1 in the country for projected job growth. We successfully got the government out of the way of the private sector and watched the economy flourish.


In 2018, I was elected to the Arizona Corporation Commission, where I fought against the Arizona Green New Deal, protected Arizona ratepayers and advanced free markets.

 

As the current CFO of Turning Point USA, I am in the trenches fighting the good fight to save our country.

 

With your support, I will continue these important efforts of advancing freedom, faith, and family, and standing up for common sense conservative principles like secure borders, the rule-of-law, the second amendment, and the right-to-life.
