Wendy Rogers, born on July 24, 1954, in Fort Knox, Kentucky, is an American politician and a Republican member of the Arizona Senate. She represents Arizona Legislative District 7 and was first elected in November 2020, assuming office on January 11, 2021.

Rogers holds a Bachelor of Social Work from Michigan State University, a Master of Social Work from the University of Alabama, and a Master of Science in National Security Studies from California State University, San Bernardino.

Before her political career, Rogers served in the United States Air Force from 1976 to 1996. She began her career treating patients in the Air Force mental health clinic. In 1981, Wendy Rogers became one of the first 100 women Air Force pilots, and went on to pilot the C-141 transport jet for worldwide airlift and humanitarian missions, and teach as a flight instructor for cadets at the US Air Force Academy. Later in her career, Rogers was stationed in Europe, where she piloted Air Force C-21 Learjets and led three different operational divisions at Rammstein Air Base. During the fall of the Berlin Wall and amid efforts by the United States to improve relations with former East Bloc countries, she was deployed for six months to run the Bosnian Airlift. Rogers retired from the Air Force in 1996 with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, over 3,000 hours of jet time, and numerous commendations including the Defense Meritorious Service Medal.

Rogers and her husband Hal own a home inspection business which operates in Coconino, Yavapai, Pinal and Maricopa counties.

In 2016, Rogers unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for a U.S. House seat from Arizona’s 1st congressional district. Rogers was the sole candidate to support Donald Trump’s Mexico–United States border wall. She also supported increasing the number of U.S. military personnel deployed to foreign conflicts. In 2018, Rogers won the Republican nomination for Congress to challenge incumbent Democrat Tom O’Halleran. Rogers received 46.1% to O’Halleran’s 53.8%.

In 2020, Rogers ran for Arizona’s 6th legislative district, defeating incumbent Sylvia Allen in the Republican primary, and defeating Democratic nominee Felicia French in the general election. The district encompasses Rim Country and the White Mountains, and extends from Flagstaff to the Arizona–New Mexico border. Following the 2020 census, she switched districts and now represents Legislative District 7.

In January 2022, Rogers announced that she had raised a record $2.5 million for her re-election campaign, breaking her own record from 2020 for the largest legislative candidate fundraising haul in Arizona history.

Rogers is Vice Chairman of the Arizona Senate Judiciary Committee, a member of the legislature’s joint Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Study Committee, and a member of the Senate’s Health and Human Services and Natural Resources, Energy and Water Committees.
