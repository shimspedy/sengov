Travis Grantham, born on February 24, 1979, in Scottsdale, Arizona, is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He is currently serving as the Speaker pro tempore of the Arizona House of Representatives, a position he assumed on January 11, 2021.

Grantham was elected to represent District 14 in the Arizona House of Representatives in 2022. Prior to this, he represented District 12 from 2017 to 2023. In addition to his political career, Grantham also sought election to the U.S. House of Representatives to represent the 9th congressional district of Arizona in 2012. However, he was defeated by Vernon Parker in the 7-way Republican primary, where he received 18.4% of the vote and came in 3rd.

In 2016, Grantham and incumbent Eddie Farnsworth defeated LaCinda Lewis in the Republican primary for Arizona's 12th legislative district. They were unopposed in the general election.

As a legislator, Grantham has been active in sponsoring and supporting various bills. In 2018, he sponsored a proposed state constitutional amendment which would have allowed the legislature to place candidates for the US Senate on the ballot. He also opposed the extension of a sales tax used to support education, arguing that the bill did not address key issues related to school funding.

Grantham received a bachelor's degree in agribusiness from Arizona State University. He joined the United States Air Force when he attended Arizona State University, reaching the rank of Major. He is also a current Lieutenant Colonel in the Arizona Air National Guard.

Outside of his political career, Grantham has worked as an aircraft maintenance technician, pilot, and business owner.
