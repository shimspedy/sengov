Lorena Austin is a dedicated community leader and a Democratic member of the Arizona House of Representatives. She represents District 9 in Mesa, Arizona. Lorena assumed office on January 9, 2023, serving alongside Seth Blattman. She succeeded Pamela Hannley.

Lorena is a fifth-generation Arizonan and a native of Mesa, Arizona. Her lifelong love for advocacy and leadership has been deeply rooted in Mesa for almost a century. Her grandparents owned and operated Albert's Market in Mesa for over twenty years, which served all residents, including minorities residing in segregated neighborhoods.

She attended Mesa Community College and later received her degree from Arizona State University. After her education, Lorena worked as a project manager for the Maricopa County Community College District. This role allowed her to further develop her leadership skills and contribute to the educational community.

In the 2022 elections, Lorena Austin and Seth Blattman were unchallenged in the Democratic Primary. They went on to defeat Republican nominees Kathy Pearce and Mary Ann Mendoza in the general election. This victory marked the beginning of Lorena's political career in the Arizona House of Representatives.

As a representative, Lorena is committed to tackling the challenges faced by her community head-on. She believes in the power of collaboration, communication, transparency, and integrity. Her dedication to these principles is evident in her work and her commitment to the people of Arizona.
