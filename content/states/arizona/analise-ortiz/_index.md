I’m a born-and-raised Arizonan and a Maryvale resident. I grew up in a family of six kids. My parents, who are both educators, taught us the importance of taking care of our community. I graduated summa cum laude from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at ASU and went on to become an investigative reporter. After uncovering government corruption and exposing harmful legislation, I realized I wanted to create policy–not just report about it. I began working at the ACLU and the ACLU of Arizona where I championed criminal justice reform and federal immigration reform. I ran for the Arizona House of Representatives in 2022 because I was tired of elected leaders forgetting they work for us–the people.

During my time as your state representative in Legislative District 24, I negotiated historic levels of investment into affordable housing and homeless services. We held town halls and events to connect with the community. And when Maryvale and Glendale residents have asked for help, I’ve taken action: I got involved when a corporation threatened to evict senior citizens from a housing complex in Maryvale. I made sure the corporation committed to assisting people with finding a new place to live and paying their moving costs.
