Analise Ortiz is an American politician, activist, and former journalist who is currently serving as a member of the Arizona House of Representatives for the 24th district. She was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 9, 2023.

Ortiz was born and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in broadcast journalism from Arizona State University in 2014. After graduation, she began her career as a breaking news reporter for The Arizona Republic. From 2015 to 2017, she worked as a multimedia journalist for KGBT-TV in Harlingen, Texas. She then worked for KTNV-TV in Las Vegas.

From 2018 to 2021, Ortiz worked for the ACLU of Arizona as a communications and campaign strategist. Since 2021, she has worked as a communication strategist at Rural Arizona Engagement.

Ortiz ran for the Arizona House of Representatives in 2022 because she was tired of elected leaders forgetting they work for the people. She currently serves as the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee and sits on the House Commerce Committee. She was appointed by Gov. Katie Hobbs to serve on the Independent Prison Oversight Commission.

During her time as a state representative, she negotiated historic levels of investment into affordable housing and homeless services. She held town halls and events to connect with the community. And when Maryvale and Glendale residents have asked for help, sheâ€™s taken action: She got involved when a corporation threatened to evict senior citizens from a housing complex in Maryvale. She made sure the corporation committed to assisting people with finding a new place to live and paying their moving costs.

Ortiz is now running to be a state senator. She hopes to earn votes in the 2024 Democratic Primary Election.
