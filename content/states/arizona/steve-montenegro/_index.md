Steve Montenegro is a Salvadoran-American Republican politician from Litchfield Park, Arizona. He is currently serving as a member of the Arizona House of Representatives, having been elected in 2022.

Born in El Salvador in 1981, Montenegro immigrated to the United States with his family at the age of four. He graduated magna cum laude from Arizona State University with a B.S. in Political Science and also holds an Associate of Arts in Theology from CBAN and Logos Christian University.

Before his election to the state House, Montenegro was a district representative for Republican Congressman Trent Franks. He was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in November 2008, succeeding John B. Nelson. He represented Legislative District 13 (the former District 12), which includes Goodyear, Litchfield Park, Avondale, and also Luke Air Force Base.

Montenegro served in the Arizona House for eight years, holding positions like Speaker Pro-Tem and Majority Leader. In 2014, he was chosen to serve as Majority Leader in the 2015–2017 session. He was later elected to the State Senate, where he served until he resigned on December 15, 2017, to focus on his congressional campaign. Unfortunately, he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for Arizona's 8th congressional district special election in 2018.

He was a Donald Trump delegate at the 2016 Republican National Convention and was also a frequent defender of the President on national TV, where his status as a conservative Latino made him a popular foil for liberal hosts and guests. He was the only Hispanic in the Arizona legislature to vote for the highly controversial Arizona SB 1070. In response to accusations of racial profiling of Hispanics, he replied by saying that "This bill has nothing to do with race or profiling. It has to do with the law. We are seeing a lot of crime here in Arizona because of the open borders that we have."

During the controversial 2021 audit, Montenegro was one of the people who had control over the combative and controversial “Audit War Room” Twitter account.
