Catherine Miranda, born on October 5, 1964, is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She is currently serving in the Arizona Senate for the 11th legislative district since 2023.

Before her current tenure, Miranda served in the Arizona Senate, representing the 27th electoral district from 2015 to 2019. She was also a member of the Arizona House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015. In 2018, Miranda ran in the Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th congressional district, challenging incumbent Democrat Ruben Gallego, but unfortunately, she lost the nomination.

In 2020, she was defeated in her attempt to return to the Arizona House of Representatives by challenging the incumbents, Reginald Bolding and Diego Rodriguez, in the Democratic primary. Miranda was first elected in the 16th district, the same seat that her late husband, Ben Miranda, had held. She was then redistricted to the 27th district.

Miranda served on the Roosevelt Elementary School District #66 Governing Board from 2008 until her election to the state House of Representatives and cites education cuts as the reason she ran for a seat in the state legislature.

Catherine Miranda was born Catherine Hernandez in south Phoenix, Arizona to parents Robert Hernandez and Ysabel Santana Hernandez. She lived in Arizona her entire life, attending Middle school at Lassen and High School at East High. When she went off to college, she attended Arizona State University to obtain her bachelor's degree and then she attended Northern Arizona University where she obtained her master's degree.

She worked as a teacher in Roosevelt Elementary School District in Arizona and went on to be a School Administrator in the Roosevelt/Cartwright/Washington districts. After that, she served as a Governing Board member in the Roosevelt Elementary School District before moving into politics.

Throughout her career, Miranda has been recognized with several awards including the John S. Martinez Award, Valle Del Sol Leadership Award, Champion of Education Award, Friend of Arizona's Cities and Towns Recognition, and Recognition from the Governor of El Salvador.
