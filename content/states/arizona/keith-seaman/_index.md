Keith Seaman is an American politician and a retired public-school teacher. He is a member of the Democratic Party and currently serves in the Arizona House of Representatives, representing District 16.

Born in Casa Grande, Arizona, Seaman dedicated four decades of his life to education, serving as a teacher, principal, and eventually the superintendent of Mohave County, Arizona. His passion for education and community service didn't end with his retirement from the education sector. Instead, he decided to further serve his community by running for the Coolidge Unified School Board.

In 2022, Seaman decided to run for a seat in the Arizona House of Representatives to represent District 16. He ran against the Republican candidate Rob Hudelson and won the election by a margin of 644 votes, which is approximately 0.62% of the total votes cast. His victory was considered an upset and marked a significant achievement for the Democratic Party in the district.

Seaman assumed office on January 9, 2023, and his current term is set to end on January 13, 2025. He serves alongside Teresa Martinez, another member of the Arizona House of Representatives from the 16th district.

In addition to his role as a state representative, Seaman is also involved in various committees, including the Land & Agriculture and Transportation Committee. His work in these committees further showcases his commitment to serving his community and the state of Arizona.

Throughout his political career, Seaman has been known for his dedication to public service and his commitment to improving the quality of education in Arizona. His experience as an educator provides him with unique insights into the challenges facing the education sector, and he is dedicated to ensuring that all Arizona students have access to high-quality education.
