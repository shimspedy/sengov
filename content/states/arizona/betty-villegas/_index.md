Betty Villegas is an American politician who is currently serving as a Democratic member of the Arizona House of Representatives for the 20th district. She assumed office on July 31, 2023, serving alongside Alma Hernandez. She succeeded Andrés Cano.

Before her tenure in the Arizona House of Representatives, Villegas was a member of the Pima County Board of Supervisors in 2020. She hails from Tucson, Arizona, a city known for its vibrant culture and rich history.

In 2016, Villegas retired from the Pima County, Arizona government where she had been working as a housing program manager of the community development and neighborhood conservation. Her work in this role was instrumental in shaping the housing policies of the county and improving the lives of its residents.

In 2020, following the death of Richard Elias, Villegas joined the Pima County Board of Supervisors. Her tenure on the board was marked by her commitment to public service and her dedication to the people of Pima County.

As a Democrat, Villegas was appointed to the Arizona House of Representatives to succeed Andrés Cano in July 2023. Her appointment was a testament to her political acumen and her ability to effectively represent the interests of her constituents.

In addition to her political career, Villegas also ran for election to the Arizona State Senate to represent District 3. Although she lost in the Democratic primary on August 28, 2018, her campaign was marked by her passion for public service and her commitment to the principles of the Democratic Party.

Betty Villegas's current term in the Arizona House of Representatives is set to end on January 13, 2025. As she continues to serve the people of Arizona, Villegas remains a dedicated public servant committed to improving the lives of her constituents.
