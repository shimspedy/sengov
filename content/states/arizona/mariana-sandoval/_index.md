Prior to her political career, she worked as a paralegal in various legal aid offices and spent 12 years at the Arizona Attorney General's office.

In addition to her work as a paralegal, Sandoval served on the governing board of the Agua Fria Union High School District from 2017 to 2020. This experience likely provided her with valuable insights into the education system, which she can bring to her role in the House of Representatives.
