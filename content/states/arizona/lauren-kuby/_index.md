Lauren Kuby is an American politician and sustainability scientist currently serving in the Arizona Senate for the 8th legislative district. She assumed office on January 13, 2025. Her current term ends on January 11, 2027.

Lauren Kuby, a former two-term councilmember and vice mayor in Tempe, is a long-time advocate for environmental, consumer, and worker protections.

PROFESSIONAL LIFE
As manager of community outreach for ASU’s Global Institute of Sustainability and Innovation, Kuby engaged the ASU community, small businesses, nonprofits, and neighborhoods in sustainable solutions. She also ran the Stardust Center for Affordable Housing and the Family. Though retired from ASU, she remains a Senior Global Futures Scientist there and continues to advocate for her community and for climate solutions.

ADVOCACY
Lauren is a recognized national champion for climate action and cities and local governments as incubators of innovation. Veteran journalist Juan Gonzales featured Lauren in his book Reclaiming Gotham, citing her as evidence of a growing movement of cities taking progressive action and challenging legislative interference in local democracies.

As a Tempe councilmember, she led efforts for social, economic, environmental, and racial justice, including climate action, equal pay, earned sick days, affordable housing, animal welfare, urban forestry, transparency, and campaign-finance reform. She spearheaded a dark-money ballot initiative, garnering 91.44% support from Tempe voters. For her efforts exposing the corruptive influence of money in politics, Lauren was featured in the inaugural episode of the MSNBC docuseries American Swamp.

Seeing the need for statewide action, in 2022, Lauren ran for Arizona Corporation Commission, with the goal of gaining  a majority of renewable energy advocates on the Commission, which Kuby called “the most important statewide office that no one’s ever heard of.” Recently, she ran for an even lesser-known office – the acreage-based SRP board – where land ownership is a requirement for voting and you vote the amount of acreage you own.
