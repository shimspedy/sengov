Eva Diaz is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She was elected in 2022 to serve in the Arizona State Senate representing District 22. This victory was particularly notable as she mounted a successful write-in campaign. This was due to the only candidate on the ballot, Diego Espinoza, withdrawing from the race.

Before her tenure in the Senate, which began on January 9, 2023, Diaz had been serving as Chair of the Tolleson Planning Commission since 2013. Her current term in the Senate is set to end on January 13, 2025.

Diaz's journey to the Senate was not a conventional one. She ran for election to the Arizona State Senate to represent District 22 and won as a write-in in the general election on November 8, 2022. This victory was a testament to her determination and the support she garnered from her constituents.

In addition to her political career, Diaz is also known for her commitment to her community. She is a tireless fighter for families and a lifelong educator. She prioritizes effective public education, quality affordable healthcare, and champions womenâ€™s and minority rights.

Diaz is an Arizona native, who grew up in Phoenix and moved to Tolleson in 1992. She continues to reside in Tolleson, Arizona. Her dedication to her community and her state is evident in her work and her public service.
