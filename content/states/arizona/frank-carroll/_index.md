Frank Carroll is an American politician and a Republican member of the Arizona Senate representing District 28 since January 9, 2023. Prior to this, he was a member of the Arizona House of Representatives from 2019 to 2023, representing House District 22. Carroll was first elected in 2018 to succeed State Representative David Livingston, who instead ran for State Senate.

According to his campaign website, Carroll was born in Chicago and later moved to Arizona, becoming involved with the Arizona Republican Party, becoming a precinct captain and precinct committeeman. He describes himself as a "Christian constitutional conservative."

Carroll was first elected to the Arizona House of Representatives for Legislative District (LD) 22 in 2018. The seat had recently been vacated by Phil Lovas, who resigned to accept a position in the Trump administration; the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors appointed Ben Toma to fill the vacancy, for the remainder of Lovas's term. In the 2017 Republican primary election, Carroll, then a Republican precinct committeeman, ran against Toma, business owner and former Peoria Unified School District member Matt Bullock, and former Maricopa County Community College District member John Heep. Toma and Carroll won the Republican primary and advanced to the general election, in which they defeated the Democratic candidates. Toma and Carroll were both reelected in 2020.

In the post-2020 redistricting cycle, Carroll and Toma, along with fellow Republican state Representative Beverly Pingerelli and state Senator David Livingston, were drawn into LD 28, which includes the northwest Valley of the Sun. However, a high-profile primary battle among incumbents was avoided, because Toma moved to District 27, and Carroll had already declared his candidacy for the Arizona State Senate seat for LD 28, which encompasses Sun City, Sun City West, much of Peoria and portions of north Phoenix. He defeated Clair Van Steenwyk in the August 2022 Republican primary, and won the November 2022 election with 61.8% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee David Sandoval, who won 38.2% of the vote.

Carroll is part of a group of far-right, self-identified Christian conservative lawmakers in Arizona. Along with fellow Republican David Livingston, he is a member of the National Association of Christian Lawmakers, an organization founded by Jason Rapert in 2019 that opposes same-sex marriage and supports anti-abortion legislation.

Before his political career, Carroll was born and raised in Chicago, where his working-class career began as a service mechanic for a forklift and construction equipment dealer. Electronics and computer technologies were making much-needed inroads, to internal combustion engines and transportation vehicles. Frank was hired on by a vehicle test equipment manufacturer advancing with the proliferation of computer control technologies. As a certified subject matter expert, he trained service technicians in the subjects of vehicle computer management systems, emission systems and their environmental impact, vehicle safety systems, electric vehicle technology, and late model vehicle diagnosis and testing. After stepping away from his training career, Frank spent the most recent years in the tourism industry while getting to know the western US interacting with locals and visitors.
