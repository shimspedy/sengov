David Marshall is an American politician, former police officer, pastor, and a Republican member of the Arizona House of Representatives. He was elected to represent District 7 in 2022.

Marshall was born in Arlington, Virginia, and raised in California, graduating from high school in Santa Ana, California. After high school, he joined the United States Air Force. After being honorably discharged, he joined the Santa Ana Police Department.

In 1999, Marshall moved with his family to Snowflake, Arizona. In Snowflake, he ran a safehouse for battered women and also became ordained as a pastor. His career experience includes working as a corporal and field training officer with the Santa Ana Police Department and the pastor of Calvary Chapel Snowflake.

In the 2022 elections, Marshall and David Cook won a three-way contest in the Republican Primary, defeating incumbent State Representative John Fillmore. They went on to defeat Independent write-in candidate Chris Verrill, as there were no Democratic nominees for the position. Marshall assumed office on January 9, 2023.

Marshall's tenure as a member of the Arizona House of Representatives has been marked by his commitment to his constituents and his dedication to public service. His current term ends on January 13, 2025.
