Sine Kerr is an American politician and a Republican member of the Arizona Senate. She represents District 25 since January 2023. Before this, she was appointed to the District 13 seat in January 2018.

Born in a military family, Sine moved to Buckeye, Arizona when she was just 3 years old after her father retired from the U.S. Army. She later married her high school sweetheart, Bill, and they have since had one son and three daughters who are all now married. They are blessed with ten grandchildren.

In 1980, Sine and Bill started their dairy business with just 15 cows. Thanks to their hard work and dedication, today they have 1,100 milk cows and 800 replacement heifers. Sine’s passion for agriculture extends beyond their farm and dairy as she sits on the AZ Farm Bureau’s Board of Directors and is serving her first term as the Women’s Leadership Chair. She also advocates frequently on behalf of AZ farmers and ranchers whenever the opportunity arises.

Her other passions include family and children’s issues, caring for and serving our veterans (five consecutive generations in her family have served in the military), and education issues. Faith, Family and Farm are the cornerstone's of Senator Sine Kerr's life.

In her political career, Kerr is known for her work in the Senate. In January 2018, she was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors from among a list of three candidates to fill the state Senate seat, which was vacated by Steve Montenegro who resigned to run for a special election for the seat in Congress vacated by Trent Franks. In August 2018, Kerr won the Republican nomination for a full term in office, defeating Brent Backus and Don Shooter.

In 2021, Kerr proposed legislation that would ban nearly all abortions in Arizona, even in cases of rape or incest. The bill would subject physicians who perform abortions, and anyone assisting them, to prison terms of almost nine years. Kerr proposed the measure as an amendment to an unrelated bill on license plate designs. Abortion-rights groups said that Kerr's proposal was flagrantly unconstitutional.

In the same year, Kerr, along with other Republican state legislators and Republican Governor Doug Ducey, supported legislation to strip the Arizona Corporation Commission (the state utilities regulator) of its power to set renewable energy portfolio standards for the state. The legislation was opposed by Democrats, environmental groups, and some business groups.

Kerr supported legislation to make it easier to block statewide voter ballot initiatives by requiring initiative proponents to gain a certain percentage of signatures in each of Arizona's 30 legislative districts to get on the ballot; the proposal would essentially allow a single district to block a ballot initiative proposal that was broadly supported elsewhere. The legislation was pushed by Republican state legislators and business interests in 2019 after Arizona voters approved an 2016 initiative to raise the state's minimum wage and a 2006 initiative to ban the use of gestation crates in pigs and calves (a measure that angered agribusiness). The legislation was opposed by the League of Women Voters.

As chair of the state Senate's Natural Resources, Energy and Water Committee, Kerr blocked legislation to protect Arizona's watersheds from being added to the committee's hearing schedule.
