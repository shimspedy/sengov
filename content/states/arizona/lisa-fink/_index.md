Lisa Fink is an American parental rights activist and politician serving as a member of the Arizona House of Representatives for the 27th district since January 13, 2025.

Lisa Fink doesn’t just talk about issues, she gets very involved with them, because making our state a better place requires rolling up our sleeves and getting it done ourselves.

A longtime education advocate, Lisa was part of a group that started a pre-K to 12 school that is consistently at the top of the rankings for schools in the area.  She also serves as the Board President of Choice Academies, Inc.

Concerned with the health and safety of children, Lisa is President of the Protect Arizona Children Coalition (PACC), which advocates for laws and policies that protect both kids and parental rights, while educating the public and lawmakers on radical efforts that target our kids with sexually explicit material, gender ideology programming, and more.  Lisa is helping to protect women’s sports and is also on the front lines of protecting minors from transgender surgeries that are irreversible and cause lifelong harm.

A constitutional conservative, Lisa has served as a member and Chairman of the Arizona State Constitutional Commemoration Committee, whose mission is to promote the principles of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in schools and the community.

And as an active member of Mommy Lobby AZ, Lisa advocates for school choice and data privacy for kids and their parents at the local and state level.

Active in our community, Lisa served as a member and later as chairman of the annual Hometown Christmas parade in Glendale, has been involved in local issues including homelessness, foster programs, and food banks, and is a high school volleyball coach.

Lisa and her husband Larry are the proud parents of six children.  He runs his own dental practice right here in LD27 and they are involved in a number of local causes as well.  Lisa has also been active in local politics for the last 25 years and has been involved in a number of local, state and federal campaigns and issues.
