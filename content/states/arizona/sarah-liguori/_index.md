Sarah Liguori: A passionate Democrat making a difference!
Arizona House leadership 
Appointed to the legislature in October 2021, Sarah lives and works in the heart of both the district she currently represents, Legislative District 28, and in the new Legislative District 5 (AZ LD5). She serves on both the Government and Elections and the Commerce Committees, where she has a strong voice pushing back against the continuous attacks on voting rights in our state.

Sarah is a strong advocate for public education, knowing that it is the foundation that gives every child the opportunity for a successful life. She is passionate about issues of equity and equality in our society. She knows we must address the threat of climate change, and work to provide clean air and quality water in order to secure a future that works for all Arizonans.

Family and Community
As a native Arizonan, Sarah has a long history of dedicated community engagement. With a background in economics and commercial real estate, she became a licensed Financial Advisor during the downturn of the Great Recession. In her advisory role at an international bank, she was able to help clients build long-term financial plans to pursue their goals. Later, she started her own practice in order to focus on small business clients, young professionals, and families. 

Sarah believes financial planning guidance should be more readily accessible to people, no matter their net worth. She values her community connections and brings her professional background in finance along with her experience as a small business owner to her role, shaping legislation that strengthens Arizona’s families.

Sarah is the mother of two sons, ages 5 and 3. She is married to Andrew – a childhood friend! – who is a radiologist at St. Joseph’s Hospital.
