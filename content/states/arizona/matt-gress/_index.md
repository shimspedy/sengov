Matt Gress is a politician and a member of the Republican Party. He was elected to represent District 4 in the Arizona House of Representatives in 2022.

Born and raised in rural Oklahoma, Gress graduated from the University of Oklahoma, where he was selected for the prestigious Harry S. Truman Scholarship. He furthered his education at Syracuse University, where he earned his master's degree.

In his early career, Gress was accepted into the Teach for America program, gaining certification to teach in English, History, Government, and Economics. His passion for education extended beyond the classroom as he served as a governing board member in the Madison Elementary School District, in central Phoenix, from 2017 until 2021.

Before his political career, Gress worked as an analyst for the non-partisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee in Arizona. He later served as Director of the Governor's Office of Strategic Planning and Budgeting, under former Governor Doug Ducey.

In the 2022 General Election, Gress was elected to the Legislature, becoming the top vote-getter in District 4 with 61,527 votes. He serves alongside Democrat Laura Terech, who came in second with 59,292 votes.

One of Gress' key campaign pledges was a plan to raise teacher pay by $10,000 per Arizona teacher. He introduced his Pay Teachers First Plan in January 2023. Gress also sponsored a bill to provide financial assistance to residents of mobile homes if they are told to vacate their homes due to redevelopment efforts. The bill was signed into law by Governor Katie Hobbs.
