I’m a physician and worked as an Orthopedic Surgeon for 40 years right here in the East Valley. I’m a 4th generation Arizonan and will always be thankful to live in one of the greatest places on earth.

I graduated magna cum laude from Arizona State University and received my medical degree from the University of Arizona. I married my high school sweetheart Denise and we have been blessed with a wonderful life that includes 3 children and 8 grandchildren. In addition to my medical practice, I volunteered as a team doctor for two local high schools as well as a stint with the Milwaukee Brewers franchise.

We have always believed in giving back and in addition to our work with our church and local causes, I spent much of my free time working as an advisor to 3 overseas medical organizations that work to help in third world countries. As part of that, I’ve served numerous medical missions providing pediatric orthopedic care to a dozen countries including Nicaragua, Bolivia, Zimbabwe and Papua New Guinea.

My hobbies run the gamut from competing in triathlons, enjoying astronomy, and playing in a bluegrass band.
