Austin Smith was born on April 20, 1995, in Glendale, Arizona. He is a proud 5th generation Arizonan. His family came to Arizona in a covered wagon before statehood in 1908 and started working the cotton fields in the West Valley.

Growing up in LD-29, he became a National FFA Award recipient and an All-State award-winning football player at Millennium High School. Working in the agricultural industry on ranches and farms across Arizona, he saw firsthand how devastating an out-of-control government can be to water, business, and freedom.

Smith was a conservative youth leader. He is a former director of Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization co-founded by Charlie Kirk and the late Bill Montgomery, and he is the former chairman of the Arizona branch of the Young Republicans. In January 2021, Smith was elected chairman of the Arizona Young Republicans Federation. He oversees Turning Point Action - Charlie Kirk's 501 (c)4 political wing of Turning Point USA. He was endorsed by Congressman Paul Gosar for the State House in January of 2022.

In August 2022, Smith defeated Hop Nguyen and Trey Terry in the Republican primary election for the 29th district of the Arizona House of Representatives. In November 2022, he defeated Scott Podeyn along with Steve Montenegro in the general election. He assumed office in 2023.

In 2023, he introduced a bill that passed the Arizona House of Representatives and the Arizona Senate to ban ranked choice voting in the State of Arizona. The measure will appear on the statewide Arizona ballot in November 2024. He is a member of the far-right Arizona Freedom Caucus in the Arizona House of Representatives. Smith is one of two youngest Republicans in history elected to the Arizona House of Representatives.
