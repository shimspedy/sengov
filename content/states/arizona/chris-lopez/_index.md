Chris Lopez, an American politician affiliated with the Republican Party, serves as a representative for District 16 in the Arizona House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 13, 2025.

Born and raised in Casa Grande, Chris Lopez has dedicated his life to upholding Conservative values. As a father, Chris knows the importance of safe neighborhoods, a secure border, and the ability to provide Arizona families with school choice. As a small business owner, he knows the importance of a thriving economy, which means limited government, low taxes, and affordable cost of living. 

Chris is committed to fighting for these Conservative values at the State Capitol. Whether it is funding police, defending the 2nd Amendment, protecting our neighborhoods, or fighting for small business owners throughout our great state, Chris is the candidate with the experience and knowledge we need at the Capitol. 

Chris lives in Casa Grande with his wife Jody, where they raised their five kids and love spending time with their seven grandchildren.

Jobs + the economy

As a small business owner, I know how important it is to have a highly qualified workforce. Government is most effective when it is smallest, allowing business owners and job creators to manage their business with the least regulation and interference. A traditional four-year degree isn’t for everyone, which is why we need skilled vocational programs and JTEDs, alongside our K-12 and university system.

By keeping our taxes low, our cost of living affordable, and implementing minimal regulation, we will continue to attract new employers and help existing companies grow. We have to recognize that attracting new talent is critical, but we cannot overlook our existing employers as we attract new companies.

Securing our Neighborhoods

Safe neighborhoods means our families can rest easy at night. It requires a combination of fully funding our police and securing our border. The federal government has continuously failed to secure our southern border which is why we have to provide state resources and assets to make sure we can safeguard our community.

The world has never been more dangerous. Today we are facing threats from drug cartels, terrorist cells, and criminals who have been empowered by liberal policies – Arizona can’t afford to maintain our status quo when it comes to protecting our neighborhoods.

Let’s back the blue – fund our police, stand behind our prosecutors, help border patrol, and keep our communities safe.

Protecting our Families

As a dad and lifelong Conservative, I will always stand behind the shared core principles of the Republican party: Life, liberty, and the ability to protect ourselves. I will always fight to protect the unborn, defend the 2nd Amendment, and stand up for private property rights. The foundational principles that make our country great will always be a cornerstone of my platform in Arizona.

Investing in our Schools

Over the last decade, the Arizona legislature has invested billions of new dollars into our schools. Even when provided with an opportunity to raise teacher pay and increase school funding, Democrats continuously voted against increasing funding for our teachers and schools (even the education unions opposed it!). I will stand with my colleagues to defend school choice and continue to make responsible, transparent, and accountable investment in our entire education system, from our elementary schools, to vocational and two-year programs.
