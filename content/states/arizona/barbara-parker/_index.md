Barbara Parker Rowley is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. She is currently serving as a representative in the Arizona House of Representatives for District 10. She assumed office on January 9, 2023, serving alongside Justin Heap. She succeeded Domingo DeGrazia.

Barbara Parker was born in Arizona and currently resides in Mesa, Arizona. She has a daughter named Jacqueline Parker. Prior to her political career, she had a successful career as a registered nurse. Her educational background includes a bachelor's degree in clinical psychology and a degree in nursing, both from Brigham Young University, Provo.

In the 2022 elections, Parker and Justin Heap were unchallenged in the Republican Primary. They went on to defeat the Democratic nominee Helen Hunter in the general election. As a result, Parker was elected to represent District 10 in the Arizona House of Representatives.

Her tenure as a representative has been marked by her commitment to the foundational values of life, family, and religious freedom. She has a deep reverence and respect for the miracle of life, which she attributes to growing up with a renowned OBGYN father. This respect for life has become part of her DNA and is reflected in her work as a lawmaker.

In addition to her work in the House of Representatives, Parker is also a member of several committees. These include the House Appropriations Committee, the House Health and Human Services Committee, where she serves as Vice Chair, and the Natural Resources, Energy and Water Committee.

Her political journey began in 1978 when, as a U.S. foreign exchange student, she survived the Iranian Revolution and witnessed how tyranny can destroy a nation. This experience has shaped her political views and her commitment to protecting American principles and saving Arizona and the Republic from failing policies.
