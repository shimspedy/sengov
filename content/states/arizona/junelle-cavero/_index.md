My name is Junelle Cavero, and I am honored to be running as a Democrat for State Representative in District 11, serving the vibrant communities of South Mountain, Guadalupe, and Laveen.

​

I come from humble beginnings, raised by hardworking immigrant parents in a trailer. From a young age, I learned the value of resilience and the importance of education in creating opportunities for a better future. My mother's journey as a dental professional, serving Medi-Cal and Medicare patients, inspired me to pursue a path of service and advocacy.

​

As a small business owner, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges entrepreneurs and local businesses face. My work involves assisting them with strategic planning, acquiring grants, and implementing effective marketing strategies. This experience has reinforced my belief in the power of entrepreneurship to drive economic growth and create jobs in our community.

​

However, my commitment to social justice extends beyond the business realm. Growing up, I volunteered with my family at a local food kitchen, where I saw the impact of community support in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable. Additionally, being raised by a Vietnam veteran and a proud U.S. Postal letter carrier, I understand the sacrifices made by our service members and the importance of supporting them when they return home.

​

When elected, I will tirelessly advocate for the issues that matter most to our district. From expanding access to affordable healthcare and quality education to fighting discrimination and promoting economic opportunity, I will work diligently to represent the voices of all constituents.

​

But I cannot do this alone. I need your support to make our vision for a stronger, more inclusive community a reality.
