Brian Fernandez is an American politician who is currently serving as the State Senator for the Arizona 23rd Legislative District. He is also a former member of the Arizona House of Representatives from the 4th legislative district, beginning his term in 2021.

Born in Yuma, U.S., Fernandez is a sixth-generation native of Yuma and a graduate of Arizona State University. Prior to joining the legislature, he volunteered for several political campaigns, including those of former Governor Janet Napolitano, Congressmen Ruben Gallego, and Congressman Ed Pastor.

In addition to his political career, Brian also founded a software startup, Team Start, which does business in Arizona and Mexico City. He attended Yuma High School where he graduated, and went on to attend Arizona State University earning a Bachelor's degree.

Fernandez worked for the Congressional Black Caucus under Chairwoman Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick as Technology Director. Upon leaving, Fernandez co-founded Symfodium, building a CRM software for members of congress. After exiting, Fernandez founded Team Start in Arizona, building software for different entities including the University of Arizona College of Medicine, Phoenix.

In November 2021, Fernandez's mother resigned to become Director of Rural Development for the United States Department of Agriculture. Within eight days Fernandez was appointed and sworn in to replace her.

In the Arizona House of Representatives, Fernandez was appointed to the unfinished term of his mother, Arizona House Democratic Leader Charlene Fernandez after her resignation to run USDA Rural Development in Arizona under President Joe Biden. Fernandez was appointed to the Committee on Transportation and the Committee on Land, Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

In the Arizona Senate, Fernandez ran for the seat left open by the retirement of Senator Lisa Otondo. He was uncontested in the primary and won the general election by over 7 points against the Republican candidate Gary Snyder. Many prominent Republicans supported him, including his seat mate Representative Joel John. Fernandez was appointed to the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Environment, the Committee on Finance, the Committee on Natural Resources and Water and the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. Governor Katie Hobbs appointed Fernandez to the Governorâ€™s Independent Prison Oversight Commission.
