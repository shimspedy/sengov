Consuelo Hernandez is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Arizona House of Representatives. She was elected to represent District 21 in 2022.

Born in Sunnyside, Arizona, Hernandez was raised in Pima County, Arizona, and attended Sunnyside schools. She completed her bachelor's degree in global health from Arizona State University and earned a master's in legal studies with a concentration in economics from the University of Arizona.

Hernandez is of Mexican-Jewish descent. She and her sister Alma Hernandez converted to Judaism after learning their maternal grandfather was Jewish. She attends Congregation Chaverim in Tucson, Arizona. Daniel Hern√°ndez Jr. is her brother.

In addition to her role in the Arizona House of Representatives, Hernandez is also the president of the Sunnyside Unified School District.

Before her successful run for the Arizona House of Representatives in 2022, Hernandez had an unsuccessful run against Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of Congressman Raul Grijalva, for a seat on the Pima County Board of Supervisors in 2020.

In April 2023, Hernandez was one of five House Democrats who voted to override Governor Katie Hobbs' veto of HB2509, a bill that would have legalized sales of "cottage foods". This bill became well-known nationally as the "Tamale Bill". However, the veto override failed by 5 votes, with 12 Democrats changing their vote from the original House vote to the override.
