Anastasia "Stacey" Travers is an American politician, scientist, and U.S. Army veteran. She is a Democratic member of the Arizona House of Representatives elected to represent District 12 in 2022.

Travers was born in Athens to a U.S. military father and a Greek mother. Coming from a family with a history of military service, she knew she wanted to serve our country and did so proudly as a Russian Intelligence Interceptor in the U.S. Army.

After leaving the Military she came to Arizona to study at the University of Arizona in Tucson where she earned her Bachelor of Science in Geosciences. She fell in love with Arizona! She wanted to further her education and left for England and postgraduate study at Oxford University.

Shortly after, she met her husband John, a small business owner, and soon afterwards began working as a radio producer for the BBC. They moved back to the United States, and as a member of AMVETS, Travers became an advocate for veteran womenâ€™s issues and homeless and disabled veterans - fighting the corruption and fraud that is currently trying to disenfranchise veterans at the Pacific Branch of the National Home for Disabled Veteran Soldiers, a cause she is still committed to.

Once she had her two girls, she knew the only place she wanted to raise her family was in Arizona, a state that prides itself on fierce independence, love of country, and strong sense of community.

Travers was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2022. She serves on the military affairs and public safety and the natural resources energy and water committees.
