Eva Burch is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She currently serves as a member of the Arizona State Senate, representing District 9. She assumed office on January 9, 2023.

Burch was born in Phoenix, Arizona, and now resides in Mesa, Arizona. She graduated from Camelback High in 1998. She attended the Pima Medical Institute, where she earned an associate's degree in nursing in 2012. She furthered her education by obtaining a Bachelor of Science in nursing from Grand Canyon University and a graduate degree from Chamberlain University.

Before entering politics, Burch had a career in nursing. She began her career in emergency nursing in 2012 and later obtained her master's degree and nurse practitioner credentials.

In the 2022 elections, Burch ran for a seat in the Arizona State Senate to represent District 9. She won the general election, defeating Republican Robert Scantlebury. Her victory was notable as she was one of several legislative candidates who had been endorsed by President Donald Trump in Arizona.

As a senator, Burch has been assigned to various committees including the Director Nominations, Senate Health and Human Services Committee, Military Affairs and Public Safety Committee, and the Senate Ethics Committee.

Her current term in the Arizona State Senate is set to end on January 13, 2025.
