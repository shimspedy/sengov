Michele Peña is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. She was elected to represent District 23 in the Arizona House of Representatives in 2022.

Born and raised in Yuma, Arizona, Peña is the daughter of an immigrant. She has a strong background in agriculture, working as an agricultural professional. In addition to her professional work, she is also a dedicated school volunteer.

Before her political career, Peña lived in Tucson, Arizona, before eventually returning to her hometown of Yuma. Her connection to her community and her understanding of the unique challenges faced by her constituents have been key factors in her political journey.

In 2023, Peña sponsored a bill that aimed to extend the expiration date of AA graded eggs in Arizona by six days. This was a significant move as Arizona is one of only two states with a limit of 24 days or less. This limit contributes to over $3 million worth of expired eggs being discarded every year in the state. The bill became a source of controversy as it passed with a bipartisan (both for and against) 4-3 vote in the Arizona Senate.

Peña's tenure in the Arizona House of Representatives began on January 9, 2023. She serves alongside Mariana Sandoval, and her term is set to end in 2025. Her predecessor in the position was John Kavanagh.

Peña's commitment to her community, her dedication to public service, and her ability to navigate complex political landscapes make her a notable figure in Arizona politics.
