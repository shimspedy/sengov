Warren Petersen is an American politician and a Republican member of the Arizona Senate. He represents District 14 and assumed office on January 9, 2023. He currently serves as President of the Arizona Senate.

Before his current role, Petersen was a State Representative, also representing District 12. He was elected by his peers to serve as Majority Leader from 2018â€“2019.

In 2012, Arizona redistricted and Legislative District 12 was drawn to cover Gilbert and Queen Creek. Steve Urie decided to leave the legislature, leaving an open seat in the House. Petersen ran in the three-way August 28, 2012, Republican primary. Incumbent Representative Eddie Farnsworth placed first, Petersen placed second with 12,500 votes, and former state Senator Larry Chesley placed third with 8,688 votes. Farnsworth and Petersen were unopposed in the November 6, 2012, general election, with Farnsworth placing first and Petersen taking second with 52,590 votes.

In 2014, Petersen and Farnsworth were unopposed in the primary, with Petersen placing first with 16,442 votes and Farnsworth placing second with 15,351 votes. In November, there was a three-way general election with Petersen taking first with 34,784 votes, Farnsworth taking second with 32,843 and Rothans receiving 18,446 votes for third place.

In 2016, Andy Biggs left the Arizona Senate to run for Congress in CD5. Petersen ran to replace Biggs in the State Senate. Petersen won the General Election 69,356 votes to Elizabeth Brown's 37,178 votes.

Petersen issued subpoenas for the Senate audit of the 2020 election. Auditors sought to conceal records to hide the origin of the audit.

In 2015 Petersen sponsored SB 1241 which banned municipalities within Arizona to require businesses to report energy usage or regulate auxiliary containers known as the plastic bag ban preemption which ensures businesses do not have to deal with inconsistent regulations across the state.

Petersen lives in Gilbert, Arizona. He graduated from Gilbert High School. He earned a bachelor's degree and a juris doctor from Arizona State University. Petersen's career experience includes owning a real estate brokerage.
