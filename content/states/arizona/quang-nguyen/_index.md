Quang H. Nguyen, born in 1962, is a Vietnamese-American businessman and politician. He is currently serving as a Republican member of the Arizona House of Representatives for District 1 since 2021. The district he represents includes most of Yavapai County and some of Maricopa County.

Nguyen has served as chair of the House Judiciary Committee since 2022. He was born in South Vietnam and left at 12 years old after the fall of Saigon. He graduated from California State University, Long Beach with a bachelor's degree in technology education.

Before becoming an elected official, Nguyen founded a marketing firm called Caddis Advertising. He was also active in public speaking and conservative causes. He is a member of the Oath Keepers, a far-right organization. Speaking about his affiliation with the group, Nguyen stated on Twitter in 2022 that "Iâ€™m an Oath Keeper. Do not ever forget it. Now what".

Nguyen first ran for Arizona House of Representatives in District 1 in 2020. He placed first in a crowded Republican primary with 30.4% of the total vote. Along with Judy Burges, he won the general election and defeated Democrat Judy Stahl. Nguyen was reelected in 2022.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Arizona, Nguyen signed onto a letter urging Governor Doug Ducey to punish school districts that enforce a mask mandate on students. Nguyen is anti-abortion, anti-vaccine card, and supports tax cuts. He strongly opposes communism, citing his experience living in Saigon during the Vietnam War.

In November 2021, he sponsored House Bill (HB) 2008 that would require the Arizona State Board of Education to update high school civics curriculum to include anti-communist narratives from people who, like Nguyen, fled communist countries. On its initial third hearing, the legislation failed to pass the Senate floor, but on reconsideration, it passed with 16 ayes and 12 nays. Ducey signed it into law on June 17, 2022.

Following his reelection in 2022, Quang was appointed chair of the House Judiciary Committee. In the fifty-fifth Legislature session (2021-2023), Nguyen served on the following committees: Military Affairs and Public Safety (Vice-chairman), Appropriations, Education, and Judiciary.
