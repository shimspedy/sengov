Michael Way, an American politician affiliated with the Republican Party, serves as a representative for District 15 in the Arizona House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 13, 2025.

Political Outsider
Michael is NOT a politician. He has spent his career in business, not government. We need bold, conservative outsiders to shake up business-as-usual and take on the political establishment, not career politicians looking for a taxpayer-paid promotion.

America-First Patriot
Simply voting “Republican” is no longer good enough. We must participate in the primary and vote for proven conservatives. Michael is a fearless fighter and an ally to President Trump and his America First Agenda.

Dedicated Family Man
Protecting the family unit is Michael’s top priority. He is a proud husband to his wife Raimee and their four beautiful children. He will not rest until Arizona families are protected, supported, and free from government control.

Education
Leader
Michael and his family have played a pivotal role in leading the fight for education reform across our nation. He has a proven track record of getting Washington out of the classroom and allowing parents to have a voice in their children’s education.
