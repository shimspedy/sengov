Justin Heap is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 10 in the Arizona House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 9, 2023, and his current term is set to end on January 13, 2025.

Heap ran for election to the Arizona House of Representatives to represent District 10 and won in the general election held on November 8, 2022. His tenure in the Arizona House of Representatives began in 2023 and is ongoing.

As a legislator, Heap's base salary is $24,000 per year. In addition, he receives a per diem for the first 120 days of regular and special sessions. The per diem amount is $35/day for legislators residing within Maricopa County and $238/day for those residing outside of Maricopa County. After the 120th day, the per diem is halved.
