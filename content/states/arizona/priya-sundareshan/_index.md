Priya Sundareshan is an American attorney and politician who is a member of the Arizona Senate from the 18th district. She assumed office on January 9, 2023.

Born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, Priya Sundareshan received her Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) in 2006. In 2011, she earned both a Juris Doctor from the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law, as well as a Master of Science in natural resource economics also from the University of Arizona.

In addition to holding elected office, Sundareshan serves as the Director of Natural Resource Use and Management Clinic at the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law. Previously, she worked as an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund from 2015 to 2019, and additionally as an associate attorney at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman in Washington, D.C. from 2012 to 2015. Sundareshan also worked as an analyst for PA Consulting Group in Cambridge, MA from 2006 to 2008.

Due to the redistricting of Arizona legislative districts resulting from the 2020 census, the 18th legislative district was relocated from the Phoenix metropolitan area to the Tucson metropolitan area, becoming an open seat. Sundareshan faced off against Arizona Legislator Morgan Abraham in the Democratic primary, defeating him 55.6% to 44.4%. Sundareshan defeated Republican former Department of Defense employee Stan Caine in the general election.

Her current term ends on January 13, 2025.
