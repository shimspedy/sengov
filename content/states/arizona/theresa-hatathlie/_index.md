Theresa Hatathlie is a Navajo politician who has made significant contributions to the state of Arizona. She has served as a member of the Arizona Senate from the 6th district since 2023. Prior to this, she was appointed to the District 7 seat in 2022 after incumbent State Senator Jamescita Peshlakai resigned from office.

Hatathlie is a member of the Democratic Party and has been actively involved in various committees during her tenure. In January 2022, she arrived at the capitol to be sworn in as an Arizona State Senator and quickly became a vital member of the senate’s Education, Government, and Commerce committees. This appointment was a direct result of her predecessor resigning from her position to pursue other opportunities.

In addition to serving in the legislature, Hatathlie is a member of the Diné College Board of Regents, and co-founded the Navajo and Hopi Families COVID-19 Relief Fund. This initiative showcases her commitment to supporting her community during challenging times.

Hatathlie is from Coal Mine Mesa, a town in Coconino County, Arizona. Her roots in the community have played a significant role in shaping her political career and her commitment to serving the people of Arizona.

In the 2022 November election, Hatathlie ran unopposed in the newly redrawn 6th District, demonstrating the trust and confidence that the people of Arizona have in her leadership.
