Flavio Bravo is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He currently serves as a member for the 26th district of the Arizona Senate. He assumed office on May 8, 2023, following the resignation of Raquel Terán.

Born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, Bravo is a fifth-generation Arizonan. He pursued his education at Loyola University Chicago, where he also served as student body president. After completing his bachelor's degree, he went on to earn a master’s degree in migration studies from the University of San Francisco.

Before his political career, Bravo spent a year in Washington, D.C., as a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute graduate fellow. His career experience includes working as an educator and a congressional staffer.

In August 2022, Bravo contested in the Democratic primary election for the 26th district of the Arizona House of Representatives. He defeated incumbent State Representative Christian Solorio and Gil Hacohen, securing his place in the general election. In November 2022, he was elected along with Cesar Aguilar to the Arizona House of Representatives. He served in the House of Representatives from January to May 2023.

Following the resignation of Raquel Terán, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors appointed Bravo to the Arizona Senate. He took office on May 8, 2023, and continues to serve the people of Arizona.
