Dave Deyoe, born on December 14, 1960, in Manhattan, Kansas, is a dedicated public servant and the Iowa State Representative from the 51st District. He has been serving in the Iowa House of Representatives since January 2007.

Deyoe's educational background includes a B.S. in animal science from Iowa State University. Before his political career, he worked as a farmer. His leadership roles extend beyond politics as he served as the president of the Story County Farm Bureau, the president of the Story County Pork Producers, and the chair of the Story County Republican Central Committee.

In the Iowa House, Deyoe has been an active member of several committees. These include the Agriculture, Appropriations, Economic Growth, and the Environmental Protection committees. He has also served as the chair of the Economic Development Appropriations budget subcommittee.

Over the years, Deyoe has participated in numerous elections. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary elections in 2008, 2010, and 2012. In the general elections, he has consistently held his seat, demonstrating the trust and support he has from his constituents.

On December 12, 2023, Deyoe announced that he would not seek re-election to the Iowa House of Representatives District 51. His current term ends on January 1, 2025. Despite his decision to step down, his contributions to the state of Iowa and his district will have a lasting impact.
