Jesse Green is an American politician serving as a member of the Iowa Senate from the 24th district. He was elected in November 2020 and assumed office on January 11, 2021.

Born and raised in Harcourt, Iowa, Green attended Community Christian School in Fort Dodge, Iowa, and graduated high school from Southeast Webster. After high school, he worked on his family's farm and later took courses at Emmaus Bible College and Iowa Central Community College.

Before entering politics, Green served on his family farm and through community service with the Dayton Rodeo and as a Bible teacher. On the family farm, they raise corn, beans, oats, hay, and rodeo livestock.

Green is a fifth-generation farmer, born and raised just outside of Harcourt. He farms corn, beans, oats, hay, bucking horses for rodeo and riding purposes, and longhorn cattle for roping with his father, brother, and nephew. He also previously taught Bible classes to 5th-8th graders at Community Christian School in Fort Dodge. Currently, Green is volunteering by teaching Pilgrims Progress at Trinity Lutheran School in Boone.

Green has been engaged in his community since joining the Webster County Farm Bureau and the Dayton Rodeo and Celebration Committee at age 24. He served the Dayton Rodeo for over six years in various positions including chairman for many of those years. He is the youngest chairman in Dayton rodeo history, which spans over 80 years. Additionally, he received the Greater Fort Dodge Growth Alliance Top 10 Under 40 Young Professionals Award in 2017.

He was elected to the Iowa Senate in November 2020 and assumed office on January 11, 2021. He has served in the Senate as Vice Chair of Labor and most recently as Chairman of Local Government along with other committee assignments.
