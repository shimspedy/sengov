Early Life and Education:
Sorensen was born in Creston, Iowa and raised in Fontanelle, Iowa. He was given the nickname "Bubba" by his dad, as he was a chubby baby, and the name stuck. Bubba grew up playing sports, showing cattle, and drawing. His love for artwork carried into a career as a Graphic Designer and a mural artist. He studied art at Iowa State University.

Career:
Prior to entering politics, Sorensen worked as a graphic designer for Edje Technologies and Livestock Plus. He also co-owns, with his wife, Sorensen Studios, a photography and mural-painting business. After watching Saving Private Ryan as a 19-year-old at Iowa State University in 1999, Sorensen was inspired to paint the first Freedom Rock, located along Interstate 80 near Menlo, Iowa.

Sorensen was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives in November 2018 and assumed office on January 14, 2019. He serves as chair of the House Economic Growth Committee. He previously served as vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee.

Personal Life:
In 2007, Bubba married his wife Maria (Galanakis) and they shortly after (2008) started their business, Sorensen Studios. In 2011, they welcomed their first child, Independence (Indie), in 2014, they welcome the birth of their second child, Michael (Mikey), named after my Dad and Great-Grandpa, and number 3 came in 2021, when Liberty (Liberty Bell, Libby) was born. With the addition of Liberty, we decided - patriotic names for girls and family names for the boys.
