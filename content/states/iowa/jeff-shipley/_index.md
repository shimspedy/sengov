Jeff Shipley is an American politician currently serving in the Iowa House of Representatives as the representative of District 87. He was born on August 9, 1988, in Euclid, Ohio, and was raised in Naperville, Illinois, where he graduated from high school.

Shipley received his B.A. in political science from the University of Iowa in 2010. Since 2011, he has been a resident of Fairfield, Iowa. His career experience includes being a sauerkraut salesman, a stand-up comedian, and a legal advocate. He has been affiliated with the Hazlitt Policy Center and the Southeast Iowa Mycological Society for the Advancement of Human Consciousness.

In March 2021, Shipley stated that the term "white privilege" is "racist on its face" and believes that when the term "white privilege" is used, it judges him based on the color of his skin, saying it was "just as Dr. Martin Luther King advised people not to do". In late January 2024, Shipley proposed a bill to remove gender identity protections from Iowa civil rights law and classify gender dysphoria as a disability. The bill was eventually rejected on January 31. Shipley previously compared affirming transgender identity or gender dysphoria to affirming a sarcoma, saying "a sarcoma would be treated with aggressive therapies to remove or heal the cancerous growth and that same medical framework should be applied to the epidemic of identity disorders".

Shipley's electoral history includes the following milestones:
- 2014 Election: Ran for Iowa House general election, District 82, and secured 48.3% votes.
- 2018 Election: Won the Iowa House general election, District 82, with 50.1% votes.
- 2020 Election: Won the Iowa House general election, District 82, with 50.47% votes.
- 2022 Election: Won the Iowa House primary elections, District 87, with 54.80% votes and later won the Iowa House general election, District 87, with 55.45% votes.
