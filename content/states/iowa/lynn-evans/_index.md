Lynn Evans is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Iowa State Senate, representing District 3. He assumed office on January 3, 2023. His current term ends on January 2, 2027.

Born and raised in Aurelia, Iowa, Lynn is a proud graduate of Aurelia High School. He completed his bachelor's degree in physical education and biology at Westmar College in 1986, followed by a master's in educational leadership and an educational specialist degree, both from Drake University, in 1996 and 2003, respectively.

Lynn has a long history of service in the field of education. He served as superintendent of the Hartley–Melvin–Sanborn Community School District from 2003, then held a dual superintendency between H–M–S and the Aurelia Community School District from 2008 to 2010, before taking on an equivalent role between Alta and Aurelia Community School District between 2011 and 2018. The two districts merged to become Alta–Aurelia Community School District in 2018, and he remained superintendent of the newly created school district until 2019. Upon retiring as a full-time superintendent, Evans became a consultant for JMC, Inc. an educational software company, and an adjunct instructor with Buena Vista University.

In addition to his work in education, Lynn has been active in politics. He contested the Republican Party primary in 2020 for the open seat in District 3 of the Iowa House of Representatives, losing to Dennis Bush. However, he did not give up and was a candidate for the Iowa Senate during the 2022 election cycle. He defeated Anthony LaBruna in a Republican party primary for District 3, winning 64.7 percent of the vote to LaBruna's 35.1 percent. In the 2022 general election, Evans ran unopposed. During the campaign, Evans expressed support for gun rights, parental involvement in education, and the abolition of abortion.

On a personal note, Lynn is married to Midge Loats, a native of Alta, Iowa. They have been married for over 37 years and have raised two children. They have lived in northwest Iowa most of their lives, raising their kids and building their lives in that part of the state. Lynn is also a member of the Aurelia First United Methodist Church and the vice president of Alta Kiwanis.
