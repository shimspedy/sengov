John Forbes, born on October 21, 1956, in Clarion, Iowa, is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Democratic Party. He has been serving as the Iowa State Representative from the 44th District since 2013.

Forbes was raised in Eagle Grove, Iowa, and graduated from Eagle Grove High School in 1975. He furthered his education at Drake University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy in 1980.

For over 32 years, Forbes has been a small business owner. He is a pharmacist and owns and operates Medicap Pharmacy in Urbandale, Iowa. His career in pharmacy has given him a unique perspective on healthcare issues, which he brings to his role in the Iowa House of Representatives.

In the Iowa House, Forbes serves on several committees, including the Commerce, Local Government, Transportation, and Ways and Means committees. He also serves as a member of the Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee. His work in these committees reflects his commitment to improving the lives of Iowans through effective legislation.

Forbes is also actively involved in his local community. He is a member and past president of the Urbandale Chamber of Commerce and serves on the board for the Urbandale Library Foundation. He has also served as the past president of the Iowa Pharmacy Association and the Polk County Pharmacists Association.

His dedication to community service has been recognized with several awards. In 2010, he received the Bowl of Hygeia Award from the Iowa Pharmacy Association for his work in community service. The following year, he won the Hero's of the Heartland Award from the American Red Cross.

Forbes and his wife Cindy reside in Urbandale, Iowa. They have two children, Adam and Meredith. He is also the son-in-law of former Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Dale M. Cochran.
