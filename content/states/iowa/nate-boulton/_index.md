Nate Boulton, born on May 23, 1980, is an American politician who has been serving in the Iowa Senate since 2017. As a member of the Democratic Party, he represents the 20th District. Boulton was first elected in 2016 to replace retiring Democratic Senator Dick Dearden.

In May 2017, Boulton announced his candidacy for the Iowa gubernatorial election, 2018 with a video on Twitter. However, he suspended his campaign in May 2018 shortly after The Des Moines Register published the accounts of three women accusing Boulton of sexual misconduct.

Boulton grew up in Columbus Junction. He earned his J.D. degree from Drake Law School in 2005 and was admitted to the Iowa bar that year. He also holds a Master’s of Public Administration from Drake University and a Bachelor’s in history and political science from Simpson College. He has served on the Simpson College Alumni Board and as an adjunct professor at Simpson.

Outside the legislature, Boulton is a partner with Hedberg & Boulton, where he practices in workers compensation, personal injury and labor law. He has served as vice-president of the Iowa Association for Justice and as president of the Iowa Workers' Compensation Advisory Committee. He also acts as a grader for the Iowa Bar Exam. He has taught courses in labor law at Drake Law School, sports law and business law at Simpson College, and organizational management and moral leadership at William Penn University.

Boulton was elected to his first term in the Iowa Senate in 2016. He represents the people of Senate District 16 on the Northeast side of Des Moines and in Pleasant Hill. He is ranking member on the Labor & Business Relations Committee. He also serves on the appropriations, commerce and judiciary committees.

On May 4, 2017 Boulton announced his candidacy for Governor of Iowa. His platform includes fighting for workers' rights, as he was an outspoken opponent of the collective bargaining bill that was passed by the Republican led Iowa Legislature. He also voiced strong support for public education in Iowa.
