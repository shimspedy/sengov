Sandy Salmon is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Iowa State Senate, representing District 29. She previously served on the Iowa House of Representatives as the Representative from District 63 from 2013 to 2023.

Born in Oklahoma where her father was stationed at the Army base Fort Sill, Sandy moved back to the family farm near Kingsley in northwest Iowa after her father's discharge. Here, she grew up amidst corn, soybeans, hogs, and cattle.

She graduated from Kingsley-Pierson High School in 1973 and later from the University of Northern Iowa in 1977 with a degree in Business Management. Upon graduation, she was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps and served from 1977 to 1980. It was during her service in the Marines that she met her husband, Matt, who is a helicopter pilot and retired from the Iowa Army National Guard with 34 years of military service.

After her discharge from the Marines, Sandy and Matt got married and have been together for 42 years. They live on an acreage near Janesville and have lived in northeast Iowa for 30 years. Sandy was a home educator for 18 years, homeschooling their three sons all the way through high school, K-12, graduating the youngest in 2007. She also helped run an area homeschool cooperative that provided group educational activities for kids such as gym, choir, drama, and speech. Additionally, Sandy served as a 4-H leader for 14 years in Black Hawk County.

Their three sons are all married with families and careers of their own, one an attorney in private practice, one a pilot for UPS and in the air guard, and one the lead pastor of Trinity Bible Church in Cedar Falls. Sandy and Matt are proud grandparents to 13 grandchildren.

Currently, Sandy partners with her sister and their farmer to manage the family farm in northwest Iowa. She was first elected to the Iowa House representing District 63 in 2012 and served through 2022. In 2022, she was elected State Senator for Iowa Senate District 29 which covers Bremer, Butler, Chickasaw, and most of Floyd counties.

Sandy Salmon is a wife, mother, and grandmother who loves God, her family, her state, and her country. As such, she is a pro-life, pro-family, and a constitutional and fiscal conservative. She feels blessed to be able to call Iowa and America home.
