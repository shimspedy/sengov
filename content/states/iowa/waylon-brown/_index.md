Born and raised in St. Ansgar, Iowa, Brown is not just a politician but also a farmer and a small businessman.

He is a graduate of St. Ansgar High School and continues to live in the area, farming in Worth and Mitchell counties.

As a legislator, Brown has been a proactive member of several committees. As of February 2020, he serves on the Transportation (Vice Chair), Agriculture, Commerce, Labor and Business Relations, and Ways and Means committees. He also serves on the Studies Committee, as well as the Administrative Rules Review Committee (Vice Chair), Fuel Distribution Percentage Formula Review Committee, State Government Efficiency Review Committee, Nonresident Deer Hunting License Committee, Nonresident Wild Turkey Hunting License Committee, and the Statewide Fire and Police Retirement System Board of Trustees.

In the 2016 Iowa Senate 26th District election, Brown secured a decisive victory with 62.38% of the votes, marking a significant gain for the Republican Party. His win signaled a shift in the political landscape and underscored his popularity among voters.
