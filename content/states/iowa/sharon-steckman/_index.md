Sharon S. Steckman, born in 1947 in Chicago, Illinois, is a dedicated representative for the 59th District of the Iowa House of Representatives since 2008. She earned a B.S. degree in education from Iowa State University and an M.S. degree, also in education, from Morningside College.

Before her political career, Sharon was a public school teacher and served as president and chief negotiator of the Mason City Education Association. Her career experience includes working as a dedicated public educator. She is known for her passion for public education, reproductive rights advocacy, and consistent constituent services.

As of October 2011, Steckman is a member of several committees in the Iowa House â€“ Ranking Chair of Education, State Government, Environmental Protection, and Education Appropriations committees. She is also the ranking member of the Education Committee and a member of the Midwestern Higher Education Compact.

In October 2009, she was elected Assistant House Majority Leader, becoming Assistant House Minority Leader when the Democrats lost their majority in 2011. She has been a fierce advocate for reproductive freedom for all people, and will continue to fight for that freedom in Des Moines.

For Sharon, no request is too small. She is in this role to be a voice for her constituents, and that work doesn't stop. There is a reason Sharon has been doing this work for 15 years; it's because she is a fighter. And she will continue to fight for all Iowans, with your help.
