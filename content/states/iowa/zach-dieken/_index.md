Zachary Dieken is an American politician who currently represents District 5 in the Iowa House of Representatives. He also serves as an Iowa State Patrol Trooper.

Dieken was born in 1990 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He graduated from George-Little Rock Senior High School and later received a bachelor's degree in sociology and criminal justice from Northwestern College in 2012. Prior to his political career, Dieken worked as an Iowa state trooper and a substitute teacher. He now resides on an acreage outside Granville, Iowa.

Dieken announced his intention to run in the Republican primary to represent the newly created fifth district of the Iowa House of Representatives on November 15, 2021. He ran as a strong conservative, emphasizing his support for a private school voucher program which incumbent Dennis Bush opposed. Dieken received an endorsement from Governor Kim Reynolds, and won the June 7, 2022 primary with 55.8% of the vote, beating Bush and Tom Kuiper.

Dieken ran unopposed in the November 8, 2022 general election and took office January 9, 2023. He serves as vice chair of the Environmental Protection committee and as a member of the Agriculture and Public Safety committees. Since taking office, Dieken has sponsored bills to increase requirements for CO2 pipeline expansions and to amend the Iowa constitution to forbid same-sex marriage.

Dieken lives in Granville, Iowa with his wife Megan and they have one son.
