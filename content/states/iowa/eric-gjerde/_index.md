Eric Gjerde is an American politician and educator who is a member of the Iowa House of Representatives from the 74th district. He was elected in 2020 and assumed office on January 11, 2021.

Early Life and Education:
Eric Gjerde was born in Spicer, Minnesota. He is the son of Ken Gjerde, a veteran of both the Army and Navy, and a retired United States Postal Service worker, and Ruth, a retired nurse. Much of his early days was spent working in his uncle and auntâ€™s family-owned grocery store, learning the ins and outs of the business before he could see over the register. Gjerde earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and religion from Augustana College, a Master of Education in secondary education and another in educational administration from the University of Iowa, and a Doctor of Education from the University of Northern Iowa.

Career:
After earning his first master's degree, Gjerde worked as a teacher and EMT in Le Roy, Minnesota. As an EdD student, he worked as a special education teacher at Clear Creek Amana High School. He has since worked as a special education teacher and coach in the Cedar Rapids Community School District. Gjerde is a volunteer deputy with the Linn County, Iowa Sheriff's Office. In 2018, Gjerde was the Democratic nominee for district 67 in the Iowa House of Representatives, losing to Ashley Hinson. After Hinson announced that she would not seek re-election to the Iowa House and instead run for the United States House of Representatives, Gjerde declared his candidacy to succeed her. He did not face an opponent in the Democratic primary and defeated Republican nominee Sally Ann Abbott in the general election.

Personal Life:
Gjerde and his wife, Amy, have three daughters.
