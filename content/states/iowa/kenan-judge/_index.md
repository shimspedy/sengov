Kenan Judge is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He has been serving as a representative of the Iowa House of Representatives from District 27 since 2019.

Born around 1957 in Ottumwa, Iowa, Judge was raised in Georgetown, an unincorporated area of Monroe County, Iowa. After graduating from Albia High School, he began his career at HyVee, a popular Midwest grocery store chain. Over the course of 38 years, he worked his way up to become an executive at the company.

In January 2018, Judge began his campaign for the District 44 seat of the Iowa House of Representatives. He won the November 2018 general election against Republican Party candidate Anna Bergman and Libertarian Party candidate Gabriel Thomson. Judge won re-election in 2020, facing Republican Dave Lorenzen and political independent David Stock.

Judge's tenure in the Iowa House of Representatives has been marked by his commitment to his constituents and his party. He has served on several committees, including the House Agriculture Committee, the House Commerce Committee, the Economic Growth Committee, and the Natural Resources Committee.

Outside of his political career, Judge has been active in his community. He has served as the chair of the Waukee Area Christian Services Annual Gala Committee and has been affiliated with the Iowa Homeless Youth Center.

Judge's dedication to public service and his extensive experience in the private sector have made him a respected figure in Iowa politics. His work in the Iowa House of Representatives continues to have a significant impact on his district and the state of Iowa.
