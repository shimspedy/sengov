Cindy Golding is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 83 in the Iowa House of Representatives. She assumed office on January 1, 2023, and her current term ends on January 1, 2025. She ran for election to the Iowa House of Representatives to represent District 83 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Cindy Golding's career experience includes owning Sweet Maple Farms and CNJ Investments and working as a farmer. She has served on the Linn County Republican Central Committee, the leadership council of the National Federation of Independent Business, the board of the Linn County Farm Bureau, and the board of Youth for Christ.

In addition to her political career, Cindy is a dedicated wife, mother of six, and grandmother of 21 perfect grandchildren. She and her husband Joe have also been “Mom” and “Dad” to nine foreign-exchange students and numerous other teens working through life challenges.

Cindy believes that education is not a one-size-fits-all solution. She supports small community schools and believes that children learn best in their own communities. She also believes that great jobs for Iowans result from successful businesses and farms. Government’s role, she believes, is to level the playing field, protect the environment, and then get out of the way and watch the magic happen.

Cindy grew up working in her family’s business of making gym mats. Following her parents’ example, she has started several successful businesses and provided employment to scores of Iowans. She owns and operates several farms, including her Sweet Maple Farms brand that produces premium Iowa maple syrup and grass horse hay.

Cindy is a staunch defender of landowner rights and has been active in several issues where government overreach has threatened property owners. In particular, she has been frustrated where eminent domain has been utilized for projects that clearly benefited big wigs of international corporations and their stockholders, but not the public good as was originally intended.
