Barb Kniff McCulla is a member of the Republican Party and currently serves in the Iowa House of Representatives, representing District 37. She assumed office on January 1, 2023, and her current term ends on January 1, 2025.

McCulla ran for election to the Iowa House of Representatives to represent District 37 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. Her career experience includes owning a business. As a small business owner for over 40 years and involved in many community, state, and national boards, she feels called to serve in the Iowa Legislature.

As a devout mother and grandmother, she wants her children and grandchildren and your children and grandchildren to have opportunities to start or grow a business and raise a family in Iowa, just as she has. She is interested in pursuing legislation that helps Iowans do just that so our greatest asset - the next generation - will stay right here in Iowa.

In the 2023-2024 legislative session, McCulla was assigned to several committees, including the House Commerce Committee, Economic Growth Committee, House Human Resources Committee, and House Ways and Means Committee, where she served as Vice Chair.

In the general election for Iowa House of Representatives District 37, McCulla defeated Mike Overman on November 8, 2022. She received 74.6% of the votes, totaling 10,593 votes. Mike Overman received 25.3% of the votes, totaling 3,591 votes. There were also 12 write-in votes.

McCulla's experience as a business owner in a highly regulated industry positions her well to be a key voice in cutting burdensome regulations across our economy so Iowa families and businesses can thrive.
