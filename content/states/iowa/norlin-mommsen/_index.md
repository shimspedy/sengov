Norlin Mommsen is a member of the Iowa House of Representatives, representing the 70th District. He was born on November 2, 1957, in Clinton, Iowa. He has served as a Republican in the Iowa House of Representatives since 2015.

Mommsen graduated from East Central High School in Miles, Iowa. His career experience includes working as a farmer. He has served on the board of directors of the Clinton County Farm Bureau and on the Clinton County 4-H Youth Board.

In February 2017, Rep. Mommsen faced controversy when he threatened a teacher & constituent who spoke out against his stance on Chapter 20. In February 2022, Rep. Mommsen sponsored a bill which would have required Iowa public schools to install cameras in every classroom so parents could watch the livestreams. The bill was tabled because it lacked the votes to clear a House subcommittee.

Mommsen has been involved with the Clinton County 4-H Youth Board, the Miles Area Lions Club, the Community Ambulance Service, and the FFA Alumni. He has also served as a Rural Representative on the Clinton County Justice Coordinating Commission and on the board of directors for the Great River Threshers.

Throughout his tenure, Mommsen has been assigned to various committees including the House Agriculture Committee, House Appropriations Committee, Natural Resources Committee, and House Transportation Committee.

In the general election for Iowa House of Representatives District 70 on November 8, 2022, incumbent Norlin Mommsen defeated Kay Pence and secured his current term, which ends on January 1, 2025.
