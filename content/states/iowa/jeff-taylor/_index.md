Jeff Taylor, born on January 30, 1961, is an American political scientist, politician, and a member of the Republican Party. He has been serving as a member of the Iowa Senate from District 2 since January 11, 2021.

Taylor hails from Spencer, Iowa. He pursued his education at Northwestern College before earning a master's degree from the University of Iowa. He furthered his academic journey by obtaining another master's degree and a doctorate from the University of Missouri. As a scholar, Taylor was an early exponent of the horseshoe theory of political ideology.

Before stepping into the political arena, Taylor dedicated eight years of his life to teaching at Dordt University. His contributions to the field of education were not limited to teaching; he also authored three published books about politics. His articles have appeared in a range of publications, including The American Conservative.

In 2012, Taylor served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Iowa. In October 2019, he announced his intention to run for the Iowa Senate. His candidacy in the Republican Party primary was certified in February 2020. Taylor reported that more than 250 signatures were submitted in his petition for ballot access. He ran unopposed in both the primary and general elections.

In July 2023, Taylor announced that he would be seeking reelection. His political values are described as decentralism, morality, freedom, grassroots, common sense, and community. These values have guided his political career and continue to shape his contributions to the Iowa Senate.
