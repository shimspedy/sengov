Taylor Robert Collins is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He is currently serving as a representative from the 95th district in the Iowa House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 9, 2023, succeeding Charlie McClintock.

Born and raised in Mediapolis, Iowa, Collins has deep roots in the community. His great-grandparents, John and Betty McCulley Sr., founded Oakville Feed and Produce, later renamed TriOak Foods, in 1951. This connection to the agricultural industry has undoubtedly influenced Collins's political career.

Collins is an alumnus of Iowa State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in business management. He furthered his education at Drake University, obtaining a master's degree in public administration. His academic journey didn't end there, as he also taught at Iowa Wesleyan University as an adjunct professor of economics and business.

Before his political career took off, Collins was actively involved in student politics. In 2018, he served as president of the College Republicans at Iowa State University. After graduating, he chaired the Iowa Federation of College Republicans.

Collins's professional career includes roles as a policy adviser to Kim Reynolds and a senior adviser to Adam Gregg. In January 2023, he began his campaign for the redrawn District 95 of the Iowa House of Representatives. This was after three-term lawmaker David Kerr announced his retirement and incumbent Charlie McClintock contested the District 42 seat in the Iowa Senate.

During his first term in office, Collins served on the House Education Committee, responsible for determining the budgets of the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, and the University of Northern Iowa. He was the floor manager for a bill proposing that the budget allocated to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the three universities be used instead to lower the in-state tuition rate and fund scholarships for lower and middle-income students.

Collins's tenure as a representative has been marked by his commitment to his constituents and his dedication to improving the state of Iowa. His current term ends on January 1, 2025.
