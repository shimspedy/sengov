Molly Donahue is an American educator and politician serving as a member of the Iowa Senate from the 37th District. She was born and raised in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where she attended Washington High School. She earned a Bachelor of Science in elementary education and teaching from Iowa State University, followed by a Master of Education in secondary behavior disabilities from the University of Northern Iowa.

For 28 years, Donahue has worked as a teacher at Washington High School, the same school she graduated from. Raised in a family with deep Iowa connections, Molly learned the value of hard work from her parents and as a teen working to save for college. As a 32-year veteran teacher in the Cedar Rapids Community School District, Molly is working at the State House with the same values she was raised with and instills in her students: integrity, compassion, and hard work.

She previously served as a member of the Iowa House of Representatives from the 68th district from 2019 to 2023, when she was elected to the Senate. Molly Donahue was elected to her first term in the Iowa Senate in 2022 after serving two terms in the Iowa House. She represents Senate District 37, which includes Marion, part of southeast and northeast Cedar Rapids.

Molly is honored to live and work in the community that she now represents. She serves on the following committees: Workforce (Ranking Member), Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee (Ranking Member), Appropriations, Education, Health and Human Resources.
