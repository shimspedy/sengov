Hans Wilz is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 25 in the Iowa House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Wilz ran for election to the Iowa House of Representatives to represent District 25 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. His career experience includes owning Edd The Florist, co-founding Sweet Bird and Company, and working as a sales specialist.

He was born and raised in Ottumwa, Iowa, where he has lived for more than 50 years. His parents were German immigrants who made Ottumwa their home in the 1950s. He has a lovely wife, a Minnesota transplant, of nearly 30 years and two sons, Andreas and Marcus.

Wilz earned a B.A. in general studies from the University of Northern Iowa in 1989. He has always enjoyed helping out in his community, whether by volunteering for events or sitting on committees. His businesses have taken him all over the world and given him a great perspective.

One thing he has learned is that you are only as good as your inputs to get a quality output. He has spent over 30 years building businesses for himself and others. Along the way, he has learned how to listen, problem solve, and find solutions. He wants to take these skills with him to the house.
