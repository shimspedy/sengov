Kevin Alons is a distinguished member of the Iowa State Senate, representing District 7. He assumed office on January 3, 2023, and his current term is set to end on January 2, 2027.

Born and raised in Iowa, Kevin Alons is a proud native of the state. He was raised near Boyden, Iowa, and graduated from Boydenâ€“Hull High School before attending Northwestern College. He is one of four children born to Dwayne Alons and his wife.

Before embarking on his political career, Alons had a 27-year career in the military, attaining the rank of colonel in the Iowa Air National Guard. He is a traditional Air National Guard Colonel and follows in the footsteps of his late father, Brig. General Dwayne Alons, who served in the Iowa National Guard and represented Sioux County in the Iowa House from 1999 to 2014.

In addition to his military service, Alons is also a successful software developer, architect, and consultant. He is associated with the eponymous Alons Software and has made significant contributions to the field.

Alons' political involvement includes two terms as chair of the Woodbury County Republican Party, and one term as treasurer. On the advice of Jim Carlin, Alons began his campaign for District 7 of the Iowa Senate in December 2021. He won the November 2022 general election unopposed, replacing Democratic legislator Jackie Smith, who was redistricted.

On a personal note, Kevin Alons has been married to his wife, Ngu, for 30 years. They have three successful adult children, two wonderful sons-in-law, and two grandsons. He has held various church leadership roles at Morningside Assembly in Sioux City.
