Julian B. Garrett, born on November 7, 1940, is an American lawyer and politician currently serving as the Senator from the 11th district in the Iowa Senate. He was born in Des Moines, Iowa, and currently resides in Indianola. He has a B.A. from Central College and a J.D. from the University of Iowa College of Law.

Garrett served as a Republican in the Iowa House of Representatives as the Representative from the 73rd District from 2011 until 2013. In November 2013, Garrett was elected to the Iowa State Senate in a special election following the resignation of Kent Sorenson who plead guilty to obstruction of justice and other felonies related to campaign finances. Garrett was subsequently re-elected in 2014, 2018, and 2022.

Garrett is a life-long Republican and has been a member of the Warren County Republican Central Committee for more than 40 years. He twice served as Ronald Reagan’s campaign chairman in the former 5th Congressional District.

Garrett grew up on a Marion County farm where he learned about hard work and personal responsibility. He has raised purebred Charolais cattle for many years and is a long time Farm Bureau member. He is a member of the Lutheran Church.

Always willing to give his time to our young people, Senator Garrett was a volunteer Little League and soccer coach for more than 12 years. He served on the Indianola Little League Board of Directors for many years, and directed the County Little League post-season tournament for Warren and surrounding counties for several years. In addition, he coached middle school mock trial teams, two of which reached the state tournament.

Senator Garrett served 12 years as Iowa’s Assistant Attorney General in Charge of Consumer Protection when that office was first established. He was elected to the Iowa House in 2010 and was re-elected in 2012. He was then elected to the Iowa Senate in a special election on November 19, 2013 and re-elected in 2014. Senator Garrett was re-elected for his second term in 2018, and his third term in 2022.
