Matt Blake was elected to his first term in the Iowa Senate in 2024. He represents Senate District 22, which includes portions of Johnston, Urbandale, Saylor Township, Crocker Township, and Des Moines.

A South Dakota native, Matt attended Drake University Law School and fell in love with Iowa. Matt and his wife chose Urbandale to start and raise their family. Within a year, Matt was already deeply involved in the community, organizing the annual Fourth of July Parade. The same year, the committee made him President of the Fourth of July Celebration. Matt has helped organize the Celebration ever since.

After law school, Matt joined the Iowa Army National Guard and serves as a Judge Advocate (JAG). Matt deployed to the Middle East in 2021 with Operation Inherent Resolve, where he served in both Kuwait and Iraq. He currently holds the rank of Major and is the Judge Advocate for 67th Troop Command out of Iowa City.

In 2019, Matt was elected to the Urbandale City Council, where he championed issues including: economic development and support of small businesses, paid family leave for city staff, growing the renewable energy infrastructure of the city, increased support for residents, and expanding the fire and police departments.

Matt, his wife Alaina, and their two children live in Urbandale. Alaina is a Waukee-based Optometrist.
