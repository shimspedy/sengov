Adrian Jeremy Dickey, born on October 23, 1973, is an American politician and a senator for the state of Iowa for District 44. He was born in Packwood, Iowa, U.S., and continues to reside there. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Dickey, the son of former longtime Packwood mayor Dave Dickey, has been a lifelong resident of Packwood. He earned a Bachelor of Technology degree with magna cum laude honors, graduating in just three years from the University of Northern Iowa. He had worked in the family business his grandfather started in 1959 since he was 13.

He is the president of Dickey Transport. In his personal life, he is a father of two. His daughter, Korynn, made headlines in 2022 when she publicly cut ties with him over his stance on abortion rights and his vote on House File 2416, which banned trans women and girls from female sports.

In 2023, Dickey was arrested for interference with official acts after allegedly refusing to move out of a roadway when asked by a police officer, amongst a crowd of already-gathered protesters as he was riding in Iowa's annual RAGBRAI. An alternative route he took brought him and his team to the isolated location.

His political career began when Mariannette Miller-Meeks resigned from her Iowa Senate, District 41 seat to fill the vacancy for Iowa's 2nd congressional district. A special election was called for by Iowa governor Kim Reynolds to fill the vacancy left by Miller-Meeks. Republican Packwood native Adrian Dickey defeated Democratic challenger Mary Stewart to win the vacant Iowa senate seat in January 2021.

He has served with the Packwood Volunteer Fire Department, the Iowa Motor Truck Association Board, and the St. Maryâ€™s Parish Council. He is currently running for re-election to the Iowa State Senate to represent District 44. He declared candidacy for the Republican primary scheduled on June 4, 2024.
