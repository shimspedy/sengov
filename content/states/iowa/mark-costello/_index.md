Costello was born in Omaha, Nebraska but moved to Imogene, Iowa as a child. He graduated from Nishna Valley High School and later attended the University of Northern Iowa, where he received a B.A. in computer information systems.

After college, Costello worked for five years as a computer analyst with Garst Seed Company based in Coon Rapids. He eventually returned to work on his family farm. He and his wife Rachel were married in 2001. They have five children and currently reside on their family farm in Mills County.

In 2012, Costello was first elected to the Iowa House representing the 23rd District. During his tenure, he served as Vice Chair of the Iowa House Health & Human Resources Budget Subcommittee. His other committee assignments included Human Resources, State Government, Veterans Affairs, and Labor.

In 2014, he won a special election to replace Joni Ernst in the Iowa State Senate after she was elected to the U.S. Senate. As of February 2020, Costello serves on several committees: Ethics (Chair), Agriculture, Appropriations, Human Resources, and Veterans Affairs. He also serves on the Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee (Chair), as well as the Health Policy Oversight Committee, Administrative Rules Review Committee, and the Medical Assistance Advisory Council.
