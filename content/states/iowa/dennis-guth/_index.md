Dennis Guth, born on December 9, 1957, is an American politician who is currently serving as the Iowa State Senator for the 27th District. She is a member of the Republican party.

Sweeney has been in the Iowa Senate since 2018, when she won a special election to replace Bill Dix after Dix resigned from the Senate. Prior to her election to the Senate, Sweeney was a member of the Iowa House of Representatives from 2009 to 2013.

Born in Buckeye, Iowa, Sweeney went to college at Concordia University Nebraska. After graduating, she taught middle school literature in Peoria, Illinois, for a short time before taking over the family farm. She married David Sweeney in 1985.

In addition to her political career, Sweeney has also owned Practical Promotions and worked as the CEO of Sweeney Farms. She served as a state director of USDA Rural Development and was a teacher prior to her political career.

Sweeney's election results show her strong performance. In the 2018 General Election, she received 16,621 votes, accounting for 61.6% of the total votes. In the 2022 General Election, she received 16,889 votes, accounting for 66.6% of the total votes.

Sweeney's commitment to her constituents and her state is evident in her work. She serves on several committees, including Natural Resources and Environment (Chair), Agriculture, Health and Human Services, International Relations (Co-Chair), and Ways and Means Subcommittee: Agriculture and Natural Resources Appropriations (Vice Chair).

An Iowa native, Senator Dennis Guth grew up on a family farm near Buckeye. After her fatherâ€™s untimely death in 1983, Senator Sweeney moved back home to Buckeye to the family farm with her mother and sister. After 40 years of operating the family farm, she and her husband passed the farm down to their son and his wife. Senator Sweeney still enjoys spending time out on the farm helping her son.
