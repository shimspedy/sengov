Robert Henderson is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 2 in the Iowa House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025. Before his tenure in the Iowa House of Representatives, Henderson was a 2018 and 2016 Republican candidate for District 14 of the Iowa House of Representatives. He also ran for an at-large seat on the Sioux City Community School District School Board in Iowa.

Born in Muncy, Pennsylvania, Henderson moved to Sioux City, Iowa, in 1989 to accept an assistant coaching position for the Morningside Mustangs football team. He subsequently worked for Penn Corp Financial before teaching within the Sioux City Community School District. His career experience includes working as a part-time teacher, an adjunct professor of mathematics, a university football coach, and a musician.

Henderson earned a bachelor's degree from Kutztown University of Pennsylvania in 1971, a master's degree from the same university in 1973, and a doctorate from the State University of New York at Albany in 1984. He has been affiliated with the Child Evangelism Fellowship of Siouxland, the Titus Fellowship of Siouxland, the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and the American Football Coaches Association.

In the 2022 general election, Henderson defeated incumbent Steve Hansen for the District 2 seat in the Iowa House of Representatives. As a legislator, Henderson has sponsored several bills, although the specific bills he sponsored are not listed due to an error in retrieving the bills. He has been assigned to the House Local Government Committee, Public Safety Committee, and House Transportation Committee for the 2023-2024 term.
