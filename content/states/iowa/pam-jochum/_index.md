Pam Jochum, born on September 26, 1954, is an American politician who is currently serving as the Iowa State Senator from the 36th District. She is a member of the Democratic Party. Before her tenure in the Senate, she was a member of the Iowa House of Representatives from 1993 to 2009.

Jochum was born and raised in Dubuque, Iowa. She graduated at the top of her class from Wahlert High School and Loras College. Before entering politics, she worked as an administrator at Loras College, and also worked at an insurance agency, Legal Aid, and a financial services company.

In her political career, Jochum has been known for her ability to build coalitions that get things done for Dubuque and Iowa. She has played a leading role in expanding affordable health insurance coverage to thousands of working Iowans and has stood up for citizens with disabilities to protect their health services when the Governor privatized Iowa’s Medicaid system.

Her support for and commitment to education has been unwavering. She has worked to expand early childhood education and ensure affordable higher education, whether at a state university, a private college or a community college.

Jochum's influence is evident throughout Iowa law—from historic reforms in Iowa’s commercial property taxes and revitalizing manufacturing to nationally acclaimed legislation in ethanol production, wind energy, solar energy and flood mitigation programs. Furthermore, through Pam’s persistent work for more than five years, our state now has the Iowa Public Information Board to ensure government transparency and access to public information and records.

Because of her strong advocacy and efforts to improve the lives of Iowans, Senator Jochum has received honors from the League of Cities, Firefighters Association, child advocacy organizations, Freedom of Information Council, physical therapists, physician assistants, pharmacists, Iowa Hospital Association, Iowa Caregivers, Iowa Health Care Association, League of Women Voters, the Dubuque Chamber of Commerce, labor unions, Girl Scouts of Eastern Iowa and many more.
