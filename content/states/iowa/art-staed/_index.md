Art Staed was elected to his first term in the Iowa Senate in 2024 after serving in the Iowa House for 14 years. He represents Senate District 40, which includes Northwest & Northeast Cedar Rapids, Hiawatha, and Robins.

Art Staed hails from Joplin, Missouri, and is one of 11 kids. He attended Rockhurst University in Kansas city, after which he obtained two graduate degrees: one in Secondary Education (University of Missouri at Kansas City) and Secondary Administration (East Central University of Oklahoma).

Early in his career, Art taught several disciplines including math, science, and social studies to students throughout Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Most recently, Art spent 15 years as Social Studies Facilitator and social studies teacher in Cedar Rapids Community Schools.

In addition to teaching courses at Kirkwood Community College and developing training in tandem with Iowa Workforce Development, Art and his wife Susan owned and managed Coffee Talk Café, where he hosted “Coffee Talk: Corridor Conversations,” a video series of talks with local community leaders about issues affecting the Cedar Rapids community. 

Art was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives in 2006. Since then, he has championed efforts to provide preschool for all eligible Iowa children, worked to pass legislation improving teacher salaries, and helped expand charitable programs that provide financial assistance to needy and homeless Iowa Veterans. Art also supported expanded incentives for small business development, expanded historic preservation tax credits, match funding for recreational trails, and additional funding for Iowa tourism.

He resides in Cedar Rapids with his wife, Susan. They have four children and five grandchildren.
