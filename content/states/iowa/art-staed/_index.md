Art Staed is a current Iowa State Representative from the 80th District. Born in 1949 in Joplin, Missouri, Staed is one of 11 children. He graduated from McAuley Regional Catholic High School and went on to earn his college degree at Rockhurst University in Kansas City. He also holds a Master’s degree in Secondary Education from The University of Missouri at Kansas City and a second Master’s in Secondary Administration from East Central University of Oklahoma.

Staed's passion for education led him to develop a 'Communities in Schools' program targeting at-risk students. This program used mentoring programs, tutoring, mental health assistance, human services, and counseling to help kids stay in school. His program received national recognition at a White House ceremony for creative and successful business-school partnerships.

In addition to his work in education, Staed was deeply troubled by the rate of domestic violence in his local community. He worked tirelessly to provide assistance, counseling, and a safe haven for victims of abuse. He co-founded The Family Shelter of Southern Oklahoma and served as a Board member while writing grants for construction and operational costs.

Briefly leaving education for a career with U.S. Cellular, Staed quickly became a direct sales supervisor and manager of numerous retail stores. This role brought him to Cedar Rapids as a national trainer to work with managers and front line sales associates throughout the country in a host of management, sales, and business development courses.

After deciding to return to public education and updating and expanding his credentials, Staed taught Business Management and Time Management courses at Kirkwood and developed workforce training at the Iowa Workforce Development office in Cedar Rapids.

Staed and his wife Susan recently sold Coffee Talk Café, where he hosted “Coffee Talk: Corridor Conversations”, a videotaped series of talks with local community leaders regarding issues that affect the Cedar Rapids community.

The citizens of district 37 elected Art to the Iowa House Representative in 2007-2008 where he served as Vice Chairman of both the Education Committee and the Economic Development Appropriations Subcommittee. He also represented Iowans on the Economic Growth, Labor, and Veterans Affairs committees.
