Dan Zumbach is an American politician and farmer from the state of Iowa. Born in 1960 in Monticello, Iowa, he grew up near Ryan, Iowa, and graduated from West Delaware High School in Manchester. He is a member of the West Delaware School Board, the Delaware County Fair Board, and the Peace Lutheran Church Council. He is married to Michelle Zumbach and the couple have two sons and two daughters.

Zumbach was first elected to the Iowa Senate for the 48th district in 2012. He was re-elected in 2016 and 2020, receiving 65% of the vote in both elections. He has served in the Iowa Senate since 2013 as a member from the 34th district and is the chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee.

In addition to his work on the family farm, Senator Zumbach is a former member of the West Delaware School Board and the Delaware County Fair Board. He is a former Delaware County 4-H leader, a former official for the Iowa High School Athletic Association, and a member of the Ryan Lions Club.

Throughout his political career, Zumbach has been assigned to various committees. He has served on the Senate Agriculture Committee, the Natural Resources & Environment Committee, the Senate Transportation Committee, the Capital Projects Committee, and the Fiscal Committee. He also sits on the Watershed Planning Advisory Council and was formerly a member of the all-terrain and off-road utility vehicle study committee between 2013 and 2014 and a member of the Iowa corn checkoff task force in 2014.

Zumbach sponsored a bill, Senate File 2127, to restrict the installation of solar panels on land which could be used to grow corn and soybeans. In January 2022, Zumbach faced an ethics complaint filed by members of the Committee to Save Bloody Run Creek which alleged that he had met with officials of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources in relation to a feedlot, Supreme Beef, owned by his son-in-law. The bipartisan ethics committee ruled unanimously to dismiss the complaint.

Zumbach's professional experience includes working on a family farm. His current term ends on January 2, 2025, and he is running for re-election to the Iowa State Senate to represent District 34. He declared candidacy for the Republican primary scheduled on June 4, 2024.
