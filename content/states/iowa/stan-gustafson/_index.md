Stan Gustafson was born on May 7, 1942, in Washington, D.C. He is an American lawyer and politician from the state of Iowa. A member of the Republican Party, he serves in the Iowa House of Representatives.

Gustafson graduated from Placer High School. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. He earned a B.S. in finance from the University of California at Berkeley and a J.D. from South Bay University. His career experience includes working as an attorney.

In August 2005, Gustafson was recalled in a special election from the Los Osos Community Sewer District due to a controversy over developing a new sewer system. After the recall of three members of the board, the city of Los Osos defaulted on low-interest loans from a state revolving fund and filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection in federal court.

On January 7, 2014, Gustafson won a special election to succeed Julian Garrett in the Iowa House for the 25th district. He currently represents the 22nd district in the Iowa House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 1, 2023.

Gustafson has been assigned to several committees during his tenure, including the House Ethics Committee, House Judiciary Committee, House Local Government Committee, and House Veterans Affairs Committee.

He resides in Cumming, Iowa with his wife, Betty. They have three children and ten grandchildren.
