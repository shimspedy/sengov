Dean C. Fisher was born on September 3, 1956, in Garwin, Iowa, U.S. He is a member of the Republican Party and has been serving as an Iowa State Representative from the 53rd District since 2013.

Early Life and Education:
Fisher was born and raised in Garwin, Iowa, in Tama County. After graduating from South Tama Community High School in 1975, he pursued higher education at the DeVry Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois. In 1978, he earned a Bachelor of Electronics Engineering Technology.

Career:
Fisher spent 26 years in the electronics industry, holding various positions such as engineer, engineering manager, and business manager. He worked for several companies including Qwint Systems, IO Vision, Autotech, and Motorola in the Automotive Electronics division from 1986 until 2004.

In addition to his professional career, Fisher has been actively involved in politics. From 2010 to 2011, he served as the chair of his county's Republican Party. He also served as the Indian Village Township Clerk from 2008 to 2013.

Since 2013, Fisher has been serving as an Iowa State Representative for the Republican Party of Iowa from the 53rd District. He has chaired the environmental protection committee and sits on the agriculture Committee and the public safety committee.

In 2023, the environmental protection committee met only four times and Fisher did not propose a single bill. However, in 2024, he proposed a raccoon bounty bill which was criticized as "fiscally irresponsible... in a state where weâ€™re defunding water quality sensors and not funding research on childhood cancer".

In January 2024, Fisher founded a private Christian school named Tama Toledo Christian School, which is set to open in August 2025. The school operations will be funded by Coverdell education savings account / private school vouchers, a bill that Republican Governor Kim Reynolds had pursued since 2021.

Personal Life:
Fisher is married to Vicky Fisher, who is also on the Board of the Tama Toledo Christian School. They reside in rural Montour, Iowa on a heritage farm which has been in his family since 1852. Fisher is a member of the National Rifle Association, Iowa Firearms Coalition, and the Amateur Trapshooting Association and the Iowa State Trapshooting Association.
