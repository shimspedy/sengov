Derek Wulf, born around 1981, is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He is currently serving as a representative from the 76th district in the Iowa House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 9, 2023, succeeding Dave Maxwell.

Wulf was born and raised in rural Black Hawk County, Iowa. He graduated from Hudson High School and continued his education at Iowa State University where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science. After graduation, he worked in Iowa agribusiness for 15 years at Cargill as a Swine Nutrition and Production Specialist.

In addition to his work at Cargill, Wulf also worked on his family farm. He married Dresden in 2007 and they have two children. At the time of his first state legislative campaign, the couple had two children.

District 76 of the Iowa House of Representatives had become an open seat following redistricting, when Dean Fisher was drawn out of the seat and Dave Williams decided not to run. Wulf defeated Tony Chavez in the June 2022 Republican Party primary. He won the general election against Democratic Party candidate Kate Wyatt.

During the 2022 election cycle, a concern about Wulf's residency in House District 76 was raised by Kimberly Karol to the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board, which dismissed the complaint.

In his career, Wulf has served as the president of the Black Hawk County Cattlemen and on the Black Hawk County Fairboard. His tenure as a representative is set to continue until 2025.
