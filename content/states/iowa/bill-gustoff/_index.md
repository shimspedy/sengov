Bill Gustoff is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 40 in the Iowa House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025. He won the general election on November 8, 2022.

Bill Gustoff was raised in Center Point, Iowa, by a municipal employee father and a school teacher mother, both of whom worked hard to support their three children. His small-town Iowa roots and working-class family life instilled in him a solid work ethic and a strong sense of community.

He is married to Sara, his wife of over 30 years, who is also an Iowa native. They have lived in Saylor Township since 2006, where they raised their four children currently ranging in ages from 26 to 13, and two of whom are still at home.

Bill Gustoff earned a J.D. from the University of Iowa in 1995. His career experience includes working as an attorney, a managing partner of Hagenow & Gustoff LLP, and the president of the legal division of Thompson & Associates.

As president of the legal division for a Nashville-based national charitable estate and gift planning firm, he has helped direct billions of dollars to charitable causes around the country. He is also a founding partner of the Hagenow Gustoff & Karas law firm, which was founded in 2009 with an express purpose of making a difference for causes that matter to Iowans.

He is a small businessman who knows the struggles of making payroll and everything else that keeps small business owners awake at night. He has also been a longtime volunteer board member for numerous nonprofit organizations and active in local church leadership circles.

His wide range of volunteer activities have included Emmaus Bible College (Board of Trustees), Habitat for Humanity of Iowa (Board Member and President), Ruth Harbor Ministries (Board Member), Iowa State Bar Association (various committees), school choice and parental organizations, and serving eight years on the State Central Committee of the Republican Party of Iowa (including the honor of being selected in each of those terms by his peers to serve as the partyâ€™s Treasurer).

It is an honor for him to serve the residents of House District 40 and all Iowans in the Iowa Legislature.
