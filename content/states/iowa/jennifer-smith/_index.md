Jennifer J. Smith is a dedicated and accomplished member of the Iowa House of Representatives, representing the 72nd district in Dubuque County. A member of the Iowa Republican Party, Smith has a strong background in education and economics, which she brings to her role as a state legislator.

Born in Madison, Wisconsin, Smith pursued her higher education at Illinois State University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1995 and a master's degree in economics in 1997. She furthered her academic journey by obtaining a Ph.D. in economics from Northern Illinois University in 2008. Her career experience includes working as an associate professor of economics, a role that has equipped her with a deep understanding of economic policies and their impact on communities.

Smith's political career began with her candidacy for the 50th district in the 2020 Iowa State Senate elections, where she was the Republican nominee. Although she did not win that election, she remained determined and continued to engage with her community. In 2022, she ran for the 72nd district but narrowly lost by just 94 votes. Undeterred, Smith ran again in 2024 and successfully defeated the Democratic incumbent, Charles Isenhart, in the general election held on November 5, 2024. She assumed office on January 1, 2025, and her current term will end on January 1, 2027.

Throughout her tenure, Smith has been a vocal advocate for policies that promote economic growth, education reform, and community development. She believes in the importance of working together to help her community thrive and is committed to representing the values and interests of her constituents in Dubuque County. Smith's dedication to public service and her expertise in economics make her a valuable asset to the Iowa House of Representatives.
