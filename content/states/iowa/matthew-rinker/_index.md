Matthew Rinker is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 99 in the Iowa House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025. He ran for election to the Iowa House of Representatives to represent District 99 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Matthew Rinker was born in Burlington, Iowa. He graduated from Burlington Community High School in 2003. After graduation, he joined the United States Navy, where he served on active duty as a military police officer from 2004 to 2008. During his time stationed abroad, he met his wife Sophie. They fell in love, and Sophie moved back to Iowa with him to start their lives together.

After returning to Iowa, Matthew and Sophie enrolled in school at Southeastern Community College. Matthew worked towards his degree in public policy, while Sophie completed her degree to become a Registered Nurse. In 2013, Matthew graduated from Western Illinois University with a degree in Political Science and Economics.

Shortly after graduation from WIU, Matthew started his career as a local Shelter Insurance agent in Burlington. He chose insurance because he saw it as an opportunity to help people when they needed it the most. As a small business owner, he learned that hard work and dedication can lead to success.

Matthew was elected to the Burlington City Council in November of 2017. He began working on the 80-million-dollar budget process that happens annually as a city councilman. The budget process was an eye-opening and informative experience because he quickly learned how much local government could impact the daily lives of those in the communities that they serve.

Matthew and Sophie started a family in 2011, welcoming their first daughter Elin into the world. Olivia, their second child, arrived soon after that. Their family experienced the all too real heartache of loss in 2016 when they lost their 3rd child Mia during childbirth. Their family prayed and prayed for the opportunity to have just one more child. God blessed them with their son Jacob in 2018, and their fourth child Lillian in 2020.
