Jacob Bossman is an American politician who represents the 14th district in the Iowa House of Representatives. Born on April 23, 1980, Bossman is a member of the Republican Party and resides in Sioux City, Iowa.

Before his political career, Bossman served as a regional director for U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley. He also worked as a constituent services specialist with the United States Senate. In addition to his work in politics, Bossman has been involved in his local community, serving as the city co-chair of the Woodbury County Republican Party.

In 2016, Bossman ran for the sixth district of the Iowa House but lost to Jim Carlin in the primary election. However, he did not let this setback deter him. In 2018, he won a special election to the Iowa House to succeed Carlin after Carlin was elected to the Iowa Senate in a special election the previous year.

As a member of the Iowa House of Representatives, Bossman has been assigned to various committees. These include the House Appropriations Committee, Labor Committee, House State Government Committee, and the Capital Projects Committee.

In the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries, Bossman endorsed Nikki Haley. His current term in the Iowa House of Representatives is set to end on January 1, 2025.

Outside of his political career, Bossman earned a B.S. in economics from Morningside University in 2002. His career experience includes working as a northwest Iowa regional director and a constituent services specialist with the United States Senate.
