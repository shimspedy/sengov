Kerry Gruenhagen is an American farmer and politician, currently serving as a member of the Iowa Senate from the 41st district. He assumed office on January 9, 2023.

Born around 1970, Gruenhagen is a resident of Walcott, Iowa. He became a member of the Muscatine County branch of the Farm Bureau in 1994, marking the start of his involvement in public service.

In December 2021, Gruenhagen announced his intention to run for District 41 of the Iowa Senate. The seat was open following redistricting, as Jim Lykam retired and Roby Smith opted to run for state treasurer. Gruenhagen defeated Alan Weets in the Republican Party primary election, held in June 2022.

In the November 2022 general election, Gruenhagen won against Democratic candidate Deb VanderGaast. His victory marked the beginning of his tenure in the Iowa State Senate, where he represents District 41. His current term ends on January 2, 2027.

In addition to his political career, Gruenhagen has experience owning a business and working as a farmer. His affiliation with the Muscatine County Farm Bureau reflects his deep ties to the agricultural community.

As a legislator, Gruenhagen has been assigned to several committees, including the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senate Commerce Committee, Senate Education Committee, and Senate Government Oversight Committee.

Throughout his career, Gruenhagen has demonstrated a commitment to serving his community and the state of Iowa. His work in the Iowa Senate continues to reflect this dedication.
