William Anthony "Bill" Dotzler Jr. was born on May 7, 1948. He is a member of the Democratic Party and has been serving as the Iowa State Senator from the 31st District since 2003. Prior to his tenure in the Senate, he served three terms in the Iowa House of Representatives, representing the 26th District from 1997 to 2003.

Dotzler was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and currently resides in Waterloo, Iowa. He graduated from Cedar Falls High School in 1966. After high school, he received his Associate of Arts degree from North Iowa Area Community College in 1969. He then served in the United States Army Office of Military Intelligence for three years, including a tour in Germany. After his military service, he enrolled at the University of Northern Iowa, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology in 1975.

Dotzler's professional career includes working as a Machine Operator and Labor Representative at John Deere Waterloo Works. He also worked for Area 7 Job Training Administration before retiring.

In the Iowa Senate, Dotzler has served on several committees, including the Appropriations committee, the Economic Growth committee, the Human Resources committee, the Labor and Business Relations committee, and the Ways and Means committee. He also served as the chair of the Economic Development Appropriations Subcommittee.

Dotzler's legislative work extends beyond his committee assignments. He has been instrumental in passing tax incentives aimed at attracting technology companies like Google and Microsoft to build facilities in Iowa. These incentives included tax breaks on sales tax from utility bills and property tax breaks.

Despite his busy legislative schedule, Dotzler has remained active in his community. He has served as the chair of the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Nursing Association, president of the Friends of Hartman Reserve Nature Center, and charter president of Cedar Trails Partnership. He was also on the initial Board of Directors of Black Hawk Leadership.

Dotzler's contributions to his state and community have earned him numerous special recognitions and awards, including the Governor’s Volunteer Service Award, the Governor’s Special Recognition Award, and the Governor’s Lifesaving Award. In 2000, he received the International Citation Award for workforce development, an award once granted to President Kennedy.
