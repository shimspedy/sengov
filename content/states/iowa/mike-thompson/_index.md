Mark Thompson is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 56 in the Iowa House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Thompson ran for election to the Iowa House of Representatives to represent District 56 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. His career experience includes working as a senior executive and a substitute teacher.

Before his political career, Thompson served in the U.S. Marine Corps. After growing up on a farm outside of Eagle Grove, he became a Marine and served 20 years in the Infantry and Reconnaissance. He went on to serve another 18 years in counterterrorism, most of which were in a leadership role. That service included being deployed to over 60 nations, many of which were very remote and poor.

In the 2022 general election for Iowa House of Representatives District 56, Thompson defeated Charles Aldrich. He received 82.2% of the votes, a total of 9,309 votes. In the Republican primary for the same district, Thompson defeated James L. Nelson with 65.2% of the votes, a total of 2,051 votes.

As a legislator, Thompson has been assigned to several committees including the Environmental Protection Committee, Natural Resources Committee, International Relations Committee, and Local Government Committee. His legislative work is complemented by his experience as a retired Marine, a retired senior executive in the federal government, and a fall harvest worker.

Thompson's contact information for legislative matters is mark.thompson@legis.iowa.gov and his capitol phone number is 515.281.3221.
