Pat Grassley, born on May 26, 1983, in Cedar Falls, Iowa, is a prominent figure in the Iowa State House of Representatives. He is a member of the Republican Party and has been serving in the Iowa House of Representatives since 2007. He represents the 57th District and has been the Speaker of the House since 2020.

Grassley's political journey began in 2006 when he ran for a seat in the Iowa House of Representatives. He won the election, defeating Alek Wipperman by a significant margin. Since then, Grassley has been re-elected multiple times, demonstrating his popularity and effectiveness as a representative.

In addition to his political career, Grassley is also known for his ties to U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, who is his grandfather. This connection has led to speculation that Pat Grassley may be being groomed to succeed his grandfather in the U.S. Senate. However, both Pat and Chuck Grassley have stated that they have not had any discussions about this possibility.

Grassley's educational background includes an A.A. in agribusiness from Hawkeye Community College. Outside of politics, he works as a farmer and has been affiliated with the Butler County Farm Bureau and the Oak Hill Cemetery Foundation Board.

In terms of his personal life, Grassley was married to Amanda Boheman, but they divorced in 2021. They have three children together.

Throughout his tenure, Grassley has held various committee assignments. In the 2023-2024 term, he was assigned to the Administration and Rules Committee, Education Reform (Chair), Legislative Council (Chair), Service Committee (Vice Chair), and Studies Committee (Vice Chair).

Grassley's political future remains a topic of interest. Despite the speculation about a potential Senate run, for now, he continues to serve the people of Iowa's 57th District in the State House of Representatives.
