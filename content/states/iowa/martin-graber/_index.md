Martin Graber is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He has been serving in the Iowa House of Representatives since 2021. Initially, he served district 83, but he is currently serving District 100.

Graber was born and raised in Donnellson, Iowa, and attended Central Lee High School. He earned a degree in business administration at the University of Iowa, and completed a master's degree in business at St. Ambrose University in 1987. He also holds a master's degree in strategic studies from the United States Army War College, which he earned in 2002.

Before his political career, Graber served 32 years in the National Guard, retiring with the rank of brigadier general within the Iowa National Guard. During Operation Desert Storm, Graber was deployed to Germany. At other times during his military career, he served with the 224th Engineer Battalion and at Camp Dodge.

In addition to his military service, Graber has also had a successful career in the corporate world. From 1980 to 1991, he was a manager within the human resources department of the Dial Corporation. From 1991, he worked for Ameriprise Financial Service in Fort Madison, Iowa, as a financial adviser.

At the time of his first state legislative campaign in 2020, Graber was still working for Ameriprise, and was serving his second term as chair of the Lee County Republican Party. Graber filed for the Republican nomination for District 83 of the Iowa House of Representatives in March 2020, and defeated incumbent legislator Jeff Kurtz in the November 2020 general elections.

In the general election for Iowa House of Representatives District 100 on November 8, 2022, incumbent Martin Graber defeated Rebecca Bowker. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025.
