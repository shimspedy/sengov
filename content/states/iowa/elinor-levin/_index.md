Elinor A. Levin is a representative of the Iowa House of Representatives, serving District 89. She assumed office on January 1, 2023, and her current term ends on January 1, 2025. She ran for election to the Iowa House of Representatives to represent District 89 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Elinor is an Iowan by choice twice over. In the fall of 2002, at a college and careers fair, she fell in love with the idea of Cornell College. It was the only school she applied to, against strong advice. In 2005, she trekked across the Mississippi River to join the incoming freshman class. She’d never lived in a place like Mount Vernon before, and she loved being able to walk the town at night with friends and classmates, talking through life and classes and the future. She led student organizations and taught in the Linn-Mar and Mount Vernon school districts. In 2009, she completed degrees in Secondary Education and English, and moved with her best friend down to Coralville, wanting to be a little closer to a bookstore, and then to Iowa City in 2010.

She volunteered at the hospital, got involved with Iowa City Community Theatre, and worked as a long-term substitute teacher until her spouse joined the US Navy as a Corpsman, and they moved to North Carolina, and then on to California, where she transitioned to private tutoring. When his contract was up, they pushed hard to return to Iowa, and his admission to UIHC Carver College of Medicine was the seal of approval. Back in her favorite place, she picked up where she’d left off, becoming President of ICCT, and even found new groups where she could work for her community. She joined the Leadership Committee of the South District Neighborhood Association, the Board of Directors for the South District SSMID, and the Voter Services Committee and Board of Directors of the League of Women Voters of Johnson County.

Elinor is an educator, a communicator, and a dedicated community servant. She has worked in public schools and as a writing tutor, and knows that our future depends on giving every Iowan chances to try things, to get excited, and to take risks and feel supported by their communities. She has been affiliated with the Iowa City Community Theatre, the League of Women Voters of Johnson County, the South District Neighborhood Association, and the Quire of Eastern Iowa.

Elinor Levin was born in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Levin graduated from William Fremd High School in 2005. He earned a B.A. in secondary education and English from Cornell College in 2009. Levin's career experience includes working as a private tutor with WyzAnt, a freelance fiction editor, and an eighth grade ELA teacher with Onslow County Schools.
