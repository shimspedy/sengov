Sami Scheetz is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Iowa House of Representatives, representing District 78. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Born and raised in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Sami's story is like so many others in America. He is the son of an immigrant teacher and a lawyer, from whom he learned the value of a good education, workersâ€™ rights, and the importance of serving one's community from a young age.

Sami graduated from George Washington High School, a public school in Cedar Rapids, where he pursued his love for swimming and served as the president of the student body. His passion for community organizing and public service was inspired by President Barack Obama.

After high school, Sami attended Georgetown University on a scholarship. During his time at Georgetown, he lived abroad in Argentina and the United Arab Emirates, where he worked for the State Department. Following his graduation, he immediately returned to Cedar Rapids to work to rebuild the Democratic Party and elect progressives to office across the state.

Sami has been organizing and working to get Democrats elected across Iowa for over a decade. He is a member and union organizer for Teamsters Local 238 in Cedar Rapids, working every day to improve the lives of working Iowans.

In the 2022 general election for the Iowa House of Representatives District 78, Sami defeated Anne Fairchild, securing 67.5% of the votes. His career experience includes working as a community organizer.

As a state representative, Sami Scheetz is committed to serving his constituents and working towards a better future for all Iowans.
