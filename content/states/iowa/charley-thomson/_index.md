His base salary as a legislator is $25,000 per year, with a per diem of $175/day for legislators who live outside of Polk County and $131.25/day for legislators who live within Polk County.

Thomson is committed to promoting economic development and fighting government overreach. He believes in cutting the red tape to promote economic development in his district. He is also a staunch advocate for freedom and continues to fight against government overreach. He is a Constitutional Conservative and has a proven record of calling out schemes to micromanage lives and rob freedoms.

Lastly, Thomson is passionate about education. He is concerned about the indoctrination of youth in public schools and the propagation of far-left propaganda. He is committed to expanding educational freedom and ensuring that the ability to teach children is taken back.
