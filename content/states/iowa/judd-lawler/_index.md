Judd Lawler is an American politician and lawyer who currently serves as a member of the Iowa House of Representatives, representing District 91. Born in 1972 in Iowa, Lawler grew up in a family of educators and attended school in the H-L-V Community School District. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in history from Yale University and a Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center.

Lawler began his career as an assistant United States attorney before deciding to return to Iowa to raise a family. His wife, Ericka, established her career as a hand surgeon and joined the University of Iowa's Carver College of Medicine as faculty. During this time, Lawler became a stay-at-home dad to their two children.

In November 2023, Lawler announced his candidacy for the Iowa House of Representatives. He was endorsed by retiring legislator Brad Sherman in the 2024 Republican Party primary for District 91. Lawler defeated Williamsburg mayor Adam Grier in the primary and went on to win the general election against Jay Gorsh.

Lawler assumed office on January 13, 2025, and has since been an active member of the Iowa House of Representatives. He serves on several standing committees, including Agriculture, Appropriations, Commerce, and Judiciary, where he holds the position of Vice Chair. Lawler is also a member of the Justice System Appropriations Subcommittee.

Throughout his career, Lawler has been dedicated to serving his community and advocating for policies that benefit his constituents. His background in law and his experience as a stay-at-home dad have given him a unique perspective on the challenges faced by families in Iowa. Lawler continues to work towards creating a better future for his district and the state of Iowa.
