Eddie Andrews, born Edgar Lee Andrews on May 31, 1966, is an American politician serving as a member of the Iowa House of Representatives for the 43rd district. He was elected in November 2020 and assumed office in 2021. He was re-elected in 2022.

Andrews was born in Des Moines, Iowa. He graduated from Des Moines East High School and earned a B.S. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Iowa. He also completed graduate coursework at the University of Massachusetts and Iowa State University, and received ministerial training at Purpose Institute. He is currently beginning a masterâ€™s program in Biblical Languages at Shiloh University.

Before entering politics, Andrews worked as an app developer and tech entrepreneur. He founded #mentoromics and volunteered with I'll Make Me A World In Iowa.

In the 2020 election, Andrews highlighted "family safety, education, low taxes and creation of entrepreneur zones to help mom and pop small businesses", but also stressed that mental health issues would be his top priority. He won the election with 50.8% of the votes.

As a member of the Iowa House of Representatives, Andrews sits on the House Commerce Committee, Public Safety Committee, and the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Additionally, he serves as the Vice Chair for the Subcommittee on Health and Human Services Appropriations.

During his tenure, Andrews ran legislation that would ban spousal-consent requirements for women who are seeking a hysterectomy. On issues of policing, Andrews initially joined democrats in voting against the "Back the Blue" bill, which created protections for police officers and punishments for protest-related offenses. He later joined republicans in voting for the bill after the legislation returned from the Senate and was amended. Andrews also pushed a parental rights bill, which would codify parental rights and protections for those rights. The legislation passed the House unanimously, but did not receive a vote in the Senate.
