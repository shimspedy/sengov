Ken Rozenboom is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Iowa State Senate, representing the 19th district. He is a member of the Republican party and has been serving in the Iowa Senate since his election in 2013.

Born in 1951 in Oskaloosa, Iowa, Rozenboom completed his high school education at Pella Christian High School. After high school, he attended Calvin College in Michigan. After completing his college education, he returned to his hometown to work on the family farm. In addition to farming, he also worked as a sales production manager.

Rozenboom's journey into politics began when he was elected as a Mahaska County Supervisor in 2010. He served in this role for two years until 2012. As of February 2020, Rozenboom serves on several committees including Natural Resources and Environment (Chair), Agriculture, Appropriations, Education, and State Government. He also serves on the Agriculture and Natural Resources Appropriations Subcommittee (Vice Chair), and Flood Mitigation Board.

In March 2019, Rozenboom was awarded the Herbert Hoover Award for his years of service to the community. However, due to redistricting, Rozenboom announced that he would not seek re-election to the Iowa Senate following changes caused by redistricting which affected his current representation.

Rozenboom is not just a politician, but also a community leader. He has served as an elder and deacon in the Bethel Christian Reformed Church and served several years on the board for the Oskaloosa Christian School. He served on community boards for many years, including a stint as chairman on two local agencies: the Human Services Resource Council, an organization that provides emergency needs for low income families, and the Christian Opportunity Center board, which provides residential and vocational services for special needs adults. Additionally, Senator Rozenboom is a member of the Mahaska County Farm Bureau.

On the personal front, Rozenboom is married to Becky and they have two children. Their daughter and son-in-law live in New South Wales, Australia, and have three children. Their adult son lives and works near Vienna, Austria, and has one child.
