Ronnie Glynn for State Rep
Your candidate for State Representative in District 67

A life-long Tennessean, Ronnie has dedicated his life to his family, country, and his community. At a very young age, Ronnie found himself the father of two children before he was 20 years old. He realized that, “in order to do better, I had to be better.”

Growing up in rural Tennessee where good-paying jobs were scarce, he decided the best way to care for his family was to join the United States Army. Ronnie’s initial plan was to serve five years and then figure out the next step. His 5-year enlistment plan expanded into 23 years of dedicated service. His career included time with the 82nd Airborne Division, 7th Special Forces Group, and three combat deployments between Afghanistan and Iraq. His final stop brought him back home to Tennessee, here in Clarksville, where he retired with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Ft. Campbell.

Ronnie served with honor, respect, and distinction throughout his career. His greatest accomplishment while serving was completing his Bachelor’s Degree and earning his Master Parachute Wings with the 7th Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, NC.

Equipped with a Bachelor’s Degree in Business and the Army’s lessons of integrity, selfless service, and leadership, Ronnie was prepared to give back to his community. In 2018, he became a mentor with Big Brothers Big Sisters and TN Achieve. In 2020, he started his first business. In 2022, Ronnie was elected to serve in the Tennessee House of Representatives for District 67, where he serves as the voice of over 77k Clarksvillans.

Ronnie’s focus has always been on Quality Education, Women’s Rights, Veterans Issues, and Infrastructure. In his first year as a State Legislator, Ronnie was able to pass a bill to help deal with Tennessee’s shortage of teachers.

Ronnie and his wife Sherry, of 32 years, have four adult children and 11 grandchildren, eight of whom are students in the Clarksville-Montgomery County School System. Spending summers with his grandchildren, he realized there was a lack of activities for school-age children in the area. Leaning on his understanding of business, he started Jumpmaster Inflatables to meet this need in the community. In 2023, Ronnie started his second business, Jumpmaster Trucking.

When he is not serving as a mentor to young folks or discussing business, on a nice sunny day, you might find Ronnie out and about playing golf, riding his Spyder (3-wheel motorcycle), or umpiring a high school baseball game.
