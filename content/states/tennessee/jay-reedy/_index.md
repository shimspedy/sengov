Jay Reedy is an American politician, farmer, and locksmith from the state of Tennessee. As a Republican, Reedy represents the 74th district of the Tennessee House of Representatives, which covers Houston, Humphreys, and Montgomery Counties. He has held this position since January 13, 2015, succeeding John Tidwell.

Before entering politics, Reedy held various roles, including cattle farmer, locksmith, army reserve officer, and Houston County election board commissioner. In 2014, he ran for the 74th district seat, challenging Democratic incumbent John Tidwell. After winning the Republican primary, Reedy narrowly defeated Tidwell in the general election with 52% of the vote. His subsequent re-elections in 2016 and 2018 were marked by increasingly dominant margins, and he faced no opposition in 2020.

In 2019, Reedy vied to replace Glen Casada as Speaker of the House but lost in an intra-caucus vote to fellow Republican Cameron Sexton. Notably, in 2023, Reedy supported a resolution to expel three Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rules, an action widely characterized as unprecedented.
