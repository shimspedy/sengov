Janice Bowling is a Republican politician representing Tennessee's 16th State Senate district. Born on April 1, 1947, in Selma, Alabama, she has been an active public official and community activist in her hometown of Tullahoma, Tennessee.

**Career Highlights:**
- **Education:** Bowling attended Auburn University.
- **Congressional Staffer:** Before entering politics, she worked as a congressional staffer.
- **State Senator:** Bowling assumed office as a member of the Tennessee State Senate on January 8, 2013, succeeding Eric Stewart.
- **Marriage License Legislation:** As a senator, Bowling sponsored a bill restricting Tennessee marriage licenses to heterosexual couples only, citing the Supreme Court's "Lemon Test." The bill aimed to issue licenses only for secular marriages between a man and a woman.
- **Early Voting Stance:** In 2021, Bowling expressed opposition to early voting in Tennessee, believing it led to "mischief." She sponsored a bill reflecting this opinion but withdrew it due to lack of support in the Tennessee House of Representatives.
- **Controversial Forrest Bust:** Following the removal of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest's bust from the Tennessee State Capitol, Bowling advocated for replacing all 29 members of the Tennessee State Historical Commission, considering it a "cancel culture" move.
- **COVID-19 Vaccine Claims:** During the pandemic, Bowling made unverified claims about COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting they could lead to genetic modification. She opposed vaccinating minors above age 14.
