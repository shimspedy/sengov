Rush Bricken is an American banker and politician from the state of Tennessee. A Republican, he represents the 47th district of the Tennessee House of Representatives, which includes Tullahoma and McMinnville. Born on August 4, 1951, Bricken received his BS from Auburn University in 1973 and later earned an MBA from Vanderbilt University's Owen School of Management while working in banking.

Bricken has spent most of his career as a banker, also working as a CPA in the 1990s and early 2000s. Since 2010, he has been the CEO of Coffee County Bank in Manchester. In addition to his banking career, Bricken has been a Coffee County Commissioner since 1988.

In 2017, Bricken announced his candidacy for the 47th district of the Tennessee House of Representatives, a seat left open after incumbent Judd Matheny announced his campaign for Tennessee's 6th congressional district. Bricken narrowly won the Republican primary election and went on to win the general election by a landslide over Democrat Mike Winton. He was sworn in on January 8, 2019.

Notably, in 2023, Bricken supported a resolution to expel two of three Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rules. He voted to expel the two young black men but not the one white woman, a decision widely characterized as unprecedented.

Outside of politics, Bricken resides in Tullahoma with his wife, Belinda. They have four children and four grandchildren.
