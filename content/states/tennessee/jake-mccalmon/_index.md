Jake McCalmon (born April 6, 1986) is an American politician from Tennessee. He is a Republican and represents District 63 in the Tennessee House of Representatives. McCalmon attended Brandman University where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. His first campaign for the State House was in 2022, when he ran to succeed Glen Casada as the representative for the 63rd district. McCalmon won the Republican primary and went on to defeat Democrat Kisha Davis in the general election. McCalmon lives in Williamson County with his wife, Rachelle, and their three daughters. In 2023, McCalmon supported a resolution to expel three Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rules. The expulsion was widely characterized as unprecedented.
