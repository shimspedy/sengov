Biography

Ron M. Gant, born on December 10, 1971, is an American insurance agent and politician from the state of Tennessee. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Political Career

Gant was first elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 2016. He represents the 94th district, which includes Fayette and McNairy Counties. His election followed the resignation of incumbent Leigh Wilburn, and interim appointee Jamie Jenkins declined to seek re-election. Gant easily won a three-way primary to fill the seat and faced no significant general election opposition in the heavily Republican district.

In addition to his role as a representative, Gant has been elected as Assistant Majority Leader in the chamber. His commitment to public service extends beyond his legislative duties.

Notable Actions

- In 2019, Gant proposed renaming the Cordell Hull State Office Building after former Governor of Tennessee Winfield Dunn. Although the move was supported by some fellow Republicans who disagreed with Cordell Hull's politics, Gant faced opposition from legislative Democrats as well as from Dunn himself. Ultimately, the building was not renamed .

- In 2023, Gant supported a resolution to expel three Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rules. The expulsion was widely characterized as unprecedented.
