Justin Augustus Lafferty (born May 13, 1971) is an American politician from the state of Tennessee. A Republican, Lafferty has represented the 89th district of the Tennessee House of Representatives since 2019. His district is based in the western suburbs of Knoxville.

**Career:**
In 2018, Roger Kane announced his retirement from the 89th district, leading to a competitive race to replace him. Despite being considered an underdog, Lafferty secured victory in the Republican primary with just over 30% of the vote. In the general election, he soundly defeated Democrat Coleen Martinez, winning by a margin of 64% to 36%.

On May 4, 2021, Lafferty made headlines for defending the Three-fifths Compromise on the Tennessee House floor. This provision, part of the original U.S. Constitution, counted three-fifths of a state's slave population for representation in the U.S. House of Representatives. Lafferty inaccurately claimed that the compromise was adopted "for the purpose of ending slavery."

In 2023, Lafferty supported resolutions to expel three Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rules.

**Personal Life:**
Lafferty resides in Knoxville with his wife and daughter.
