Senator Charlane Oliver is a proven leader who Tennesseans can rely on to address tough issues at their root, enable disenfranchised communities to thrive, and fight for equity and justice. Hailed as a “Now Generation Activist” and the 2020 “Person of the Year” by The Tennessean, she serves in her first term in the Tennessee General Assembly, representing Tennessee’s 19th Senatorial District in Nashville.

Her family's multi-generational lineage of public service spans two centuries, with ancestors who served in the United States Armed Forces during the Civil War, World War II, and Vietnam War. Charlane's upbringing in Little Rock, Arkansas, instilled in her a deep passion to advocate for vulnerable communities, especially those overlooked and undervalued.

Tennessee became her home over 20 years ago when she moved to Nashville as a college student bound for Vanderbilt University. There, she earned a Bachelor of Science in Human & Organizational Development and later a Master of Public Administration from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.

Charlane co-founded and served as the former co-executive director of The Equity Alliance, a statewide 501(c)(3) nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization. Under her visionary leadership, the organization grew from $250 of her own money to a $2.5 million-dollar powerhouse with 12 employees and three chapters across the state. The Equity Alliance registered 91,000 Black and brown Tennesseans to vote for the 2018 midterms, increased Black voter turnout by 413 percent, scored two legal voting rights victories against the Tennessee Secretary of State, and played a pivotal role in electing the most diverse, progressive, majority-female Metro Council in Nashville's history.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Charlane ensured that Black and Brown communities received their fair share of federal C.A.R.E.S. Act resources to combat the pandemic.

Senator Charlane Oliver's courageous impact on the lives of others continues to inspire positive change and progress.
