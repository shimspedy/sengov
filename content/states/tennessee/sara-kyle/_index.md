Sara Peery Kyle (born October 21, 1952) is an American attorney and politician. She is a member of the Democratic Party and currently represents the 30th district in the Tennessee Senate. Notably, she became the second woman elected to statewide office in Tennessee when she won the race for Public Service Commissioner in 1994.

**Early Life and Education:**
Kyle was born in 1952 to Bruce and Emma Gene Clement Peery in Dickson, Tennessee. She graduated from Dickson High School in 1970. Her family has a strong political legacy: she is the niece of former Tennessee governor Frank G. Clement and former Tennessee state senator Anna Belle Clement O'Brien.

**Career Highlights:**
- In 1994, Kyle was elected to the Public Service Commission. Later, this elected position was replaced by the appointed Tennessee Regulatory Authority, to which Kyle was appointed in 1996 by then Democratic Speaker Jimmy Naifeh.
- She served successive terms on the Regulatory Authority until March 2013 when she resigned, citing changes made by Republican Governor Bill Haslam that rendered the agency ineffective.
- In 2014, she was elected to an interim 2-year term representing the 30th district in the Tennessee Senate after her husband retired from the seat mid-term.
- Kyle won re-election to the state senate in 2016, running unopposed in the general election.
- Notably, she voted for a bill that would have designated the Bible as the official state book in Tennessee, a bill that was ultimately vetoed by Governor Bill Haslam.
- In 2019, Kyle proposed bills related to arrests and child custody and support, both of which were passed.

**Personal Life:**
Sara Kyle is married to Jim Kyle, and they have four children. She resides in Memphis, Tennessee.
