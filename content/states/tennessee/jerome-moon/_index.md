Jerome Moon, born on June 20, 1947, is an American politician representing parts of Blount County in the Tennessee House of Representatives. A Republican, he assumed office on December 13, 2017, after being appointed to the State House seat vacated by Art Swann.

**Career Highlights:**
- **Former Chair of Blount County Commission:** Before joining the State House, Moon served as the chair of the Blount County Commission.
- **Voting Record:** In 2023, during a critical moment, Moon voted in favor of motions to remove three sitting Democratic representatives—Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones, and Justin J. Pearson—for disrupting proceedings with a protest. The protest occurred as demonstrators voiced their outrage over a mass shooting at a Nashville school that left six dead. While Pearson and Jones were expelled, Johnson was not removed from office.

**Personal Details:**
- **Spouse:** Deborah
- **Children:** 2 daughters

Jerome Moon continues to represent District 8, and his current term ends on November 5, 2024. He is running for re-election to the Tennessee House of Representatives.
