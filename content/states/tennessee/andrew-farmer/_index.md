Andrew Ellis Farmer (born December 14, 1979) is an American politician and a Republican member of the Tennessee House of Representatives. He has held the District 17 seat since January 8, 2013. Farmer earned his bachelor's degree in business administration from East Tennessee State University and his JD from Thomas M. Cooley Law School. As an attorney, he has actively served in the legislature, advocating for his constituents.

During the 2023 legislative session, Farmer supported motions to remove three sitting Democratic representatives — Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones, and Justin J. Pearson — for "knowingly and intentionally bringing disorder and dishonor" and "generally engaging in disorderly and disruptive conduct." These proceedings were shut down due to protests at the capitol following a school shooting in Nashville that left six dead. Farmer sponsored HR 65, the resolution to remove Jones, which passed with a vote of 72–25. He was also the sponsor of HR 63, the resolution to remove Pearson.

In the 2012 elections, Farmer won the three-way August 2, 2012 Republican Primary against incumbent Representative Frank S. Niceley, securing 52.1% of the votes. He then went on to win the November 6, 2012 General election with 76.1% of the votes against Democratic nominee Mike Dockery.
