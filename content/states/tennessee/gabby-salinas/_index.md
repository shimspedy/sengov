At the age of seven, she was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma, a rare form of cancer. This diagnosis led her family to relocate to Memphis, Tennessee, where she received treatment at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

However, her perseverance paid off in 2024 when she won the Democratic primary for District 96 and ran unopposed in the general election.
