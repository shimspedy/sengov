Todd Warner, born and raised on a dairy farm in Chapel Hill, Tennessee, is a dedicated row crop farmer specializing in corn and soybeans. He graduated from Forrest High School in 1989 and married his wife, Cindy, in 1991. Together, they have three children: Patrick, Kathleen, and Cason.

Representative Warner, a Republican, assumed office on November 3, 2020, representing District 92. His commitment to conservative values has made him a strong voice in the Tennessee House. He stands firmly for the Second Amendment, religious liberty, parental rights, medical freedom, and election integrity.

In 2023, Warner supported a resolution to expel three Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rulesâ€”an unprecedented move. Despite being one of several legislators whose homes and offices were raided by the FBI in relation to an investigation into campaign fund laundering, Warner has not been charged with any crimes.

On a personal note, Warner faced tragedy when his nephew, James William Warner, was found murdered in Nashville. He described James as someone who "loved life and loved people," and the loss was deeply felt.

As a member of the Tennessee House, Representative Warner serves on committees such as the Education Administration Committee and the Education Instruction Committee. He continues to advocate for the principles he holds dear, making a lasting impact on his community and the state.
