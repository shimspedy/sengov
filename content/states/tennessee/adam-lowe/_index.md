J. Adam Lowe, born on January 8, 1981, is an American Republican politician who currently serves as the senator for Tennessee's 1st Senate district. The district includes most of Bradley, McMinn, Meigs, and Rhea Counties. It was previously numbered as District 9 prior to the 2020 United States redistricting cycle.

Lowe's political career began when he served on the Bradley County Commission for District 3 from 2010 to 2014. In October 2013, Lowe announced his intent to run for Tennessee House of Representatives District 22 after then-incumbent Eric Watson announced his intent to vacate the seat to run for Bradley County Sheriff. However, he was defeated by Dan Howell, receiving 2,017 votes, or 42.6% of the total. Despite this setback, Lowe continued his political journey and served as a delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention.

In January 2022, Lowe announced his intent to run for then-State Senate District 9, which was being vacated by Mike Bell. He won the August 4 primary with 53% of the vote, or 9,651 total votes, defeating then-24th District State Representative Mark Hall. He then went on to defeat Democrat Patricia Waters in the general election on November 8.

On a personal note, Lowe is married to Rachel and they have four children. He is an alumnus of Lee University and the University of Tennessee. He earned a B.A. from Lee University, an M.P.A. from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and a Ph.D. in education policy from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
