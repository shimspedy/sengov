Kelly T. Keisling is an American politician and a Republican member of the Tennessee House of Representatives representing District 38 since January 2011. He attended Belmont University.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Keisling opposed vaccine requirements. In 2012, he sent a mass email through his state email account, drawing national attention, which claimed President Barack Obama was planning a fake assassination attempt as a pretext for imposing martial law to keep the 2012 election from happening.

In the 2012 election, Keisling won with 14,190 votes (71.8%) against Democratic nominee David Harper. In the 2010 election, he defeated incumbent Democratic Representative Leslie Winningham with 7,965 votes (56.5%).

Keisling's support for a resolution to expel three Democratic lawmakers from the legislature in 2023 was widely characterized as unprecedented.
