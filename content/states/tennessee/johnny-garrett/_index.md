Johnny C. Garrett (born August 8, 1978) is an American attorney and politician from the state of Tennessee. A member of the Republican Party, Garrett has represented the 45th district of the Tennessee House of Representatives, based in the northern suburbs of Nashville, since 2019.

**Early Life:**
Johnny C. Garrett was born on August 8, 1978, to John Claude Garrett and his wife Susan Garrett. His father served as president of the Bank of Goodlettsville and co-owner of Cole and Garrett Funeral Home and Cremation Services.

**Education:**
Garrett earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Tennessee and a Juris Doctor from Nashville School of Law.

**Career:**
Garrett began practicing law in Sumner County in 2006, representing businesses and entrepreneurs. In 2018, he won the Republican primary to replace incumbent Courtney Rogers in the 45th district. He secured victory in the general election with nearly 70% of the vote and was sworn into office in January 2019. Garrett was elected as majority whip by his House colleagues for the 2020 legislative session.

**Controversy:**
In 2023, Garrett co-sponsored a resolution to expel Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rules. The expulsion was widely characterized as unprecedented. Following public outrage, robocalls falsely claimed that Antifa members came to the Capitol, and Garrett was praised for "standing up to the radical liberals and their two-tiered justice system."

**Personal Life:**
Garrett was born and raised in Goodlettsville, where he continues to live with his wife and three children.
