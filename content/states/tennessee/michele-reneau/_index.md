Michele Reneau is a member of the Republican Party serving in the Tennessee House of Representatives. She represents District 27 and assumed office on November 5, 2024. Her current term is set to end on November 3, 2026.

Michele Reneau grew up in a working-class family in South Carolina. Her father served in the U.S. Army for 26 years, meeting her mother in South Korea, where her mother worked as a seamstress in a rug factory. Michele’s upbringing was deeply influenced by her mother’s faith and values, which instilled in her a strong sense of determination and resilience. She became the first in her family to graduate from high school and college, earning a Political Science degree from the College of Charleston and a Master’s in Public Administration from the University of South Carolina.

Her career began in real estate, where she quickly rose to prominence, closing dozens of properties annually and earning recognition as one of the top realtors in Charleston, South Carolina. Michele’s success in real estate was a testament to her work ethic and ability to navigate challenges, including the 2008 financial crisis.

In 2004, Michele married Chris Reneau, a Navy Chief Petty Officer who served in Operation Enduring Freedom. Together, they relocated to Signal Mountain, Tennessee, where they are raising their five children. Michele’s commitment to family values and her advocacy for military families have been central to her personal and professional life.

Michele has also been a passionate advocate for local farmers and fresh food initiatives. She played a key role in preserving the TN Herd Share Act and supported legislation to enhance farm-to-consumer distribution. Her efforts in these areas reflect her dedication to community well-being and sustainable practices.

As a legislator, Michele Reneau focuses on strengthening families, promoting self-sufficiency, and fostering a sense of community. Her journey from a working-class background to a position of leadership exemplifies her belief in hard work, faith, and the importance of giving back to society.
