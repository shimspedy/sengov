Justin Shea Bautista-Jones (born August 25, 1995) is an American activist and politician from the state of Tennessee. A member of the Democratic Party, he serves in the Tennessee House of Representatives for District 52, representing parts of Nashville.

Early Life and Education:
- Born on August 25, 1995, in Oakland, California, Justin is the grandson of black, working-class grandparents from the South Side of Chicago and Filipino immigrants of Ibanag and Aeta ancestry who migrated to California.
- His mother, Christine, raised Justin and his sister while putting herself through nursing school.
- He earned a Bachelor of Arts from Fisk University and enrolled at Vanderbilt Divinity School.
- In 2019, he campaigned for the removal of a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest from the Tennessee State Capitol.

Early Career and Activism:
- In 2019, Jones announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives in Tennessee's 5th congressional district but did not submit enough valid signatures to make the ballot.
- He was arrested for refusing to leave a rally held by Marsha Blackburn in October 2018.
- In 2019, he was charged with assaulting Glen Casada, a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, by allegedly throwing a drink (believed to be hot coffee) at him. He was also banned from the Capitol.
- In 2020, Jones organized a 62-day sit-in protest for racial justice outside the state capitol after the murder of George Floyd. He faced multiple charges related to the protest, including assault and reckless endangerment.
- Many of the charges were dropped in July 2021, but the reckless endangerment charges remained.

Expulsion and Restoration:
- Jones was expelled in April 2023 for violating decorum rules by participating in a gun control protest on the House floor.
- The Nashville Metro Council voted unanimously to reinstate Jones to serve as an interim representative pending a special election to fill the seat.

As of 2023, Jones is the second youngest member of the State House. Despite controversies, his activism and commitment to social justice continue to shape his political journey.
