# Representative Chris Todd

Chris Todd, born on November 26, 1966, is an American biologist and politician from the state of Tennessee. He is a Republican and has represented the 73rd district of the Tennessee House of Representatives since 2019.

Chris Todd grew up in Paris, Tennessee, in a family with strong ties to agriculture. His grandfather raised hogs, cattle, beans, and corn. Todd attended Union University, where he earned a degree in biology.

After graduating from Union University, Todd worked as an environmental specialist with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Additionally, he owns and operates Envirogreen Inc., a landscaping and erosion prevention company.

In 2018, Todd announced his candidacy for the 73rd district of the Tennessee House of Representatives, a seat previously held by retiring Republican Jimmy Eldridge.

In the general election, he easily defeated Democrat James Baxter, given the district's conservative leanings.
