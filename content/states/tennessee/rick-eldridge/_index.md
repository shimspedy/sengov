**Political Career:**
- Eldridge previously served as a Hamblen County commissioner for eight years, including two terms as chairman.
- In 2018, he ran for election to the District 10 seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives, succeeding Tilman Goins.
- Eldridge secured victory in the Republican primary against Tommy Pedigo and went on to defeat Democrat Barbara Simmons in the general election.
- In 2020, he ran unopposed in both the Republican primary and general election, securing re-election with 17,133 votes.
- Notably, in August 2021, Eldridge joined all state house Republicans in signing a letter calling for a special session to address schools requiring masks. Governor Bill Lee later issued an executive order allowing parents to opt students out of mask mandates.
- In October 2021, Eldridge voted in favor of a bill allowing partisan elections for school boards, a departure from the traditional nonpartisan approach in Tennessee.
- He also voiced opposition to the state's new redistricting plan, which would split Hamblen County into District 10 (west) and District 11 (east).
- In 2023, Eldridge supported a resolution to expel Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rulesâ€”an unprecedented move.
