Mark White (born March 11, 1950, in Union City, Tennessee) is an American politician. He has been serving as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives since January 12, 2010. District 83, which he represents, includes Germantown, Bartlett, Cordova, and portions of East Memphis.

Before entering politics, White held various roles in education and small business. After graduating from the University of Memphis, he began his career as a teacher and principal at Harding Academy of Memphis. Later, he spent 25 years in the small business sector.

In 2006, White ran as the Republican nominee for the U.S. Congress in Tennessee's 9th congressional district. However, he placed third in the general election, with 18 percent of the vote, behind Democrat Steve Cohen (60 percent) and independent Jake Ford (22 percent). This was the worst showing for a Republican in the district since the 1950s.

White's commitment to public service continued when he won a special election in 2010 to fill the vacant seat in District 83. He was subsequently elected to a full term later that year. Notably, in 2023, White supported a resolution to expel three Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rulesâ€”an action widely characterized as unprecedented.

Mark White remains an active representative, advocating for his constituents and contributing to Tennessee's legislative processes.
