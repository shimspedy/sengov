Shane Reeves is an American businessman, pharmacist, and politician. Born on January 18, 1968, in Murfreesboro, TN, he grew up in a family that valued faith, family, and freedom. His parents were Carolyn Reeves, a school teacher, and Richard Reeves, a small business owner, city councilman, and former mayor of Murfreesboro.

Reeves attended Oakland High School and later Middle Tennessee State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree. He then pursued Pharmacy School at the University of Tennessee Memphis, graduating in 1994. In 1995, Reeves and Rick Sain purchased Reeves-Powell Drug Store, renaming it Reeves-Sain Drug Store. The business thrived until its closure in December 2018, after which Reeves co-founded Twelvestone Health Partners in 2016.

In 2018, Reeves campaigned as a conservative Republican in the Tennessee State Senate District 14 Special Election. The election was necessitated by a vacant seat due to Jim Tracy's acceptance of a position with the Trump Administration. Reeves secured the endorsement of Jim Tracy and won both the primary and general elections. Since taking office, he has actively participated in Senate committees and been elected Chaplain for the 111th General Assembly.

Reeves lives in Murfreesboro with his wife, Amanda, and their three children: Will, Jack, and Emma-White. He is also a deacon at North Blvd. Church of Christ.

Senator Shane Reeves uses his experience as a pharmacist to find conservative solutions for our growing opioid crisis. His background uniquely equips him to develop common-sense solutions to our current healthcare challenges.
