Justin J. Pearson is an American activist and politician. Born on January 7, 1995, in Memphis, Tennessee, he represents the 86th district, covering parts of the city of Memphis. Pearson was elected in a January 2023 special election to succeed Barbara Cooper, who was posthumously re-elected in the November 2022 Tennessee House of Representatives election after passing away in October 2022.

At the age of 28, Pearson became the third youngest lawmaker serving in the Tennessee House of Representatives. His commitment to environmental activism is notable. In 2020, he co-founded the environmental advocacy group Memphis Community Against Pollution (originally Memphis Community Against the Pipeline), which successfully campaigned to cancel construction of the Byhalia Pipeline. This pipeline would have passed through poor black neighborhoods in south Memphis and over the Memphis sand aquifer, which provides water to residents in the area.

Pearson's dedication extends beyond politics. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 2017, majoring in Government & Legal Studies with a minor in Education Studies. While at Bowdoin, he was a Mellon Mays fellow and participated in the summer public policy institute at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.

In April 2023, Pearson and fellow state representative Justin Jones were expelled for violating decorum rules by participating in a gun control protest on the House floor. However, Pearson was later reinstated.

As a community organizer and servant leader, Pearson prioritizes the needs of the people. His journey from student activism to elected office exemplifies his commitment to positive change.
