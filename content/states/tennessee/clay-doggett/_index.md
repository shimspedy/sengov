Clay Doggett (born September 5, 1983) is an American businessman, law enforcement officer, and politician from the state of Tennessee. A Republican, Doggett has represented the 70th district of the Tennessee House of Representatives since 2019.

Before entering politics, Doggett worked in law enforcement as a correctional officer and a sheriff's deputy. He is also the founder and owner of a pressure washing company.

In 2018, Doggett ran as a "grassroots conservative" against incumbent Barry Doss in the Republican primary for the 70th district. He narrowly defeated Doss with 52% of the vote and went on to win the general election against Democrat Jessica Yokley.

During his tenure, Doggett co-sponsored constitutional carry legislation, which passed in 2021. He also sponsored the "Second Amendment Privacy and Protection Act of 2021," preventing the creation of a registry to track legal firearm owners in the state.

Doggett lives in Pulaski, Tennessee, with his wife, Mary, and their three children.
