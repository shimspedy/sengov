Robert Stevens (born May 23, 1985) is an American politician from Tennessee. He is a Republican and has been serving as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives since November 8, 2022. Stevens graduated from Middle Tennessee Christian School and holds a degree in political science from Lipscomb University. He also earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Memphis.

In 2023, Stevens made headlines when he supported a resolution to expel Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rulesâ€”an action widely characterized as unprecedented. His commitment to legislative decorum underscores his dedication to maintaining a respectful and productive political environment.
