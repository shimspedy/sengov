Arthur "Art" Morton Swann was born on October 17, 1952, in Blount County, Tennessee. He is a Republican member of the Tennessee Senate, representing the 2nd district since December 1, 2017. Prior to being appointed to the state senate to replace Doug Overbey, Swann served in the Tennessee House of Representatives, representing the 8th District.

Swann graduated from Maryville High School in Maryville, Tennessee, and later earned a Bachelor of Science in political science and history from the University of Tennessee at Martin in 1975. He is married to Janet Caldwell Swann.

Before his political career, Swann worked as a forest product representative. He also served as a Director of the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority and was a Blount County Commissioner from 1978 to 1982.

In addition to his political career, Swann has been involved in various controversies. He was one of twenty-four members of the Tennessee Senate Republican Caucus who signed a letter in support of President Donald Trump's effort to contest the results of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. This letter signed by Swann cites "irregularities" in Michigan, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania.

On January 9, 2024, Swann announced that he would retire from the Senate, and not seek re-election.
