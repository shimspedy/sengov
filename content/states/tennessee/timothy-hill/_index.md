Timothy Aaron Hill (born November 9, 1981) is an American politician and a Republican member of the Tennessee House of Representatives. He currently represents District 3.

**Early Life and Family Background:**
Timothy Hill was born on November 9, 1981, in Blountville, Tennessee. His father, Kenneth C. Hill, served as a Tennessee Regulatory Authority director, appointed during January 2009 by Blountville resident and Tennessee Lt. Governor Ron Ramsey. Notably, his brother, Matthew Hill, also serves in the Tennessee House of Representatives.

**Education:**
Hill graduated from Tri-Cities Christian Academy in 2000. He earned an associate degree from Northeast State Community College and a bachelor's degree from East Tennessee State University.

**Career Highlights:**
Before entering politics, Hill worked as a talk show host for the 501(c)(3) Appalachian Educational Communication Corporation (AECC), which was managed by his family. Later, he transitioned to a radio talk show host role at the for-profit Information Communications Corporation (d.b.a. WPWT 870 AM et al), owned by his father and the non-profit AECC.

Hill also served as a congressional press secretary and communications director for former U.S. Representative David Davis in Washington, D.C. However, he resigned after using a government computer at the U.S. House of Representatives to edit Wikipedia articles related to King Pharmaceuticals and its founder, John M. Gregory. Gregory had ties to both Davis and Hill's brother, Tennessee State Representative Matthew Hill.

Additionally, Hill co-owns Right Way Marketing, LLC (since 2009) with his brother, Rep. Matthew Hill. He was also the sole owner of Bonzo's Fireworks stand in Johnson County, Tennessee.

**House Majority Whip:**
In February 2016, Hill was selected by the Republican Caucus as the House Majority Whip of the Tennessee House of Representatives, following the resignation of Republican Representative Jeremy Durham.

Timothy Hill continues to serve as a dedicated representative, advocating for his constituents and contributing to Tennessee's legislative landscape.
