Torrey C. Harris (born March 12, 1991) is an American politician serving as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives from the 91st district. He was elected in 2020 and assumed office on January 12, 2021. Alongside Eddie Mannis, Harris made history as one of the first two openly LGBT state representatives elected in Tennessee.

In the 2020 Tennessee State House elections, Torrey challenged incumbent John DeBerry, who had re-registered as an independent. Torrey secured victory with an impressive 77.3% of the vote. In the 2022 Tennessee State House elections, after being redistricted to District 91, he won an uncontested election, representing a significant portion of Midtown and other east Memphis neighborhoods.

Despite his political achievements, Harris faced legal issues. On July 17, 2022, he was arrested for felony theft and misdemeanor assault following a domestic dispute with his ex-boyfriend.

Torrey Harris is not only Tennessee's first openly LGBTQ lawmaker but also the state's youngest, making his presence in the House District 90 a milestone victory for the Democratic Party.
