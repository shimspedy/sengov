Kirk Haston (born March 10, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player and politician. He played for Indiana University under coach Bobby Knight between 1998–99 and 2000–01. Haston was subsequently drafted 16th overall in the 2001 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets. During his college career, he led the Big Ten Conference in scoring and was a third-team All-American selection.

In the 2000–01 season, Haston's buzzer-beating three-pointer helped IU beat the defending champion and top-ranked Michigan State 59–58 at Assembly Hall. Tragically, during his sophomore year, he lost his mother, Patti Kirk Haston, 48, in a tornado that hit the county seat, Linden, Tennessee on May 5, 1999.

Haston played in the NBA for two years, primarily as a reserve player. His final NBA game was played on March 7, 2003, in a 102–76 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. In his final game, Haston recorded 2 points and 1 rebound in 8 minutes of play. He also played the 2004–05 season with the Florida Flame in the NBA D-League, where he averaged 16 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game.

Since 2019, Haston has been a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 72nd state congressional district as a Republican. He was elected with 81% of the vote and assumed office on November 6, 2018. In January 2019, Haston was appointed as the Vice Chairman of Tennessee's House Education Committe.
