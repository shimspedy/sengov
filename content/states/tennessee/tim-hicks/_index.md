Tim Hicks (born August 29, 1963) is an American businessman and politician. He assumed office as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives on January 12, 2021. Representing the 6th district, Hicks is a Republican.

**Education:**
Hicks graduated from Daniel Boone High School in 1981.

**Career:**
Outside of politics, Hicks owns Hicks Construction. In November 2020, he was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives after defeating incumbent James Van Huss in the August 2020 Republican primary.

In 2023, the Tennessee House voted on motions to remove three sitting Democratic representatives — Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones, and Justin J. Pearson — for disrupting proceedings with a protest as citizens were at the capitol voicing their outrage over a mass shooting at a Nashville school that left six dead. Hicks voted in favor of all three resolutions: HR 63, to remove Pearson; HR 64, to remove Johnson; and HR 65, to remove Jones  . Pearson and Jones were expelled, while Johnson was not.
