Paul Sherrell is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He has been serving as the Representative for District 43 in the Tennessee House of Representatives since November 8, 2016. Sherrell won a three-way Republican primary with 45.16% of the vote and secured victory in the general election against Democratic incumbent Kevin Dunlap. He was re-elected in 2018 and ran again in 2020.

In November 2018, Tennessee House Republicans elected Sherrell to serve as Majority Floor Leader[^1^][1]. As of June 2020, he sat on several committees, including the Judiciary Committee, Constitutional Protections & Sentencing Subcommittee, Health Committee, Mental Health & Substance Abuse Subcommittee, and Naming, Designating, & Private Acts Committee.

However, Sherrell faced controversy during deliberations on a bill proposed by Dennis Powers to allow the use of firing squads as an execution method in March 2023. He suggested adding "an amendment on that that would include hanging by a tree also," which was criticized as a racist reference to lynching. Sherrell later apologized for the remarks. Members of the Tennessee Black Caucus criticized his apology as "insincere" and campaigned for his reprimand, suggesting removal from committees and resignation.

In 2023, Sherrell supported resolutions to expel three Democratic lawmakers from the legislature for violating decorum rules.
