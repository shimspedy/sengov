A lifelong Hoosier, Sen. Andrea Hunley moved to Indianapolis after graduating from Indiana University to pursue her first teaching job. She taught English on Indy’s west side in one of the largest high schools in the state. She then went on to serve for 10 years as principal of an award-winning K-8 Indianapolis Public School.

Sen. Hunley earned a Master’s Degree in Language Education and a Bachelor’s Degree in Secondary Education from Indiana University. She holds a PK-12 School Administrator license, license to teach middle and high school English, and a license to teach English as a New Language.

Originally from Fort Wayne, Sen. Hunley was in the foster care system and adopted at a young age. Supporting our vulnerable children and families is a priority for her.
Sen. Hunley has experienced the joys and challenges of small business ownership and the importance of the creative economy with her husband of 15 years, Ryan, who is the Owner/Art Director of Second Street Creative.

Sen. Hunley enjoys biking on the Cultural Trail with her husband their two school-age children. As a proud one-car family, they are privileged to live within walking distance to work, school, shops, and a convenient bus route.
