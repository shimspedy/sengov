State Representative Wendy McNamara represents Indiana House District 76, which includes Posey and portions of Vanderburgh counties. She was born and raised in Indiana and received her undergraduate degree in Political Science from the University of Indianapolis, teacher certification from Valparaiso University and Masters in Education and Educational Leadership from the University of Southern Indiana.

Rep. McNamara brings many years of experience, knowledge and leadership to the Indiana House of Representatives with her educational career spanning more than 27 years with the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation. She served as a Teacher and Department Chair at Benjamin Bosse High School and at Harrison High School, as the Supervisor of Social Studies and as the Assistant Principal at North High School.

Currently, she serves as the Director of Early College High School. This is a position she has truly been innovative in by developing a model for high school students who simultaneously earn both a high school diploma and an Associate’s degree or two years of college credit toward a Bachelor’s degree.

She has served as an adjunct professor for World History at the University of Southern Indiana and has taught Political Science and Social Studies Methods at the University of Evansville. Rep. McNamara served as Constitution Coordinator for the Indiana Congressional District 8 ‘We the People’ and as an Executive Board Member for the Indiana Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (IASCD).

Through her dedication and passion for education, she has earned many prestigious awards. In 2009, Rep. McNamara received the Lawrence Senesh Award for School Administrators from the Indiana Council for Economic Education. She has been the Who’s Who Among America’s Teachers for years, 2004, 2005 and 2006.

She was the nominee for the Evansville Courier and University Evansville High School Teacher of the Year for the 2004-2005 school year and as a finalist for the 2002-2003 school year. Rep. McNamara was the Bosse Teacher of the Year for the 2001-2002 school year and received the Indiana National Guard Nighthawk Educator Award in 2000 and in 2006.

Throughout her tenure as a representative, Rep. McNamara continues to advocate for pro-business polices, education and the creation of a better Hoosier state. She lives in Evansville with her dog Yuki.
