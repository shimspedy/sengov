State Rep. Lori Goss-Reaves took the oath of office in June 2023 to represent House District 31, which includes portions of Grant and Madison Counties.

Goss-Reaves works as a professor of social work and director of field placement at Indiana Wesleyan University. She also serves on the Prevent Child Abuse Council of Grant County.

Goss-Reaves began her career as a social worker for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities before earning her master's in social work from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. She later earned her doctorate in social work from Capella University. She worked as a mental health therapist for adolescents on probation and children and adult survivors of sexual abuse. She also facilitated social skills groups and directed a school-based services program prior to teaching full time at Indiana Wesleyan University.

Goss-Reaves is the daughter of a Navy corpsman who was killed in action in the Vietnam War, which led her to author a book, "Kiss Lori for Me," about her father's sacrifice.

She resides in Marion with her husband, Eric, where they attend College Wesleyan Church and LifeGroup. They have five adult children and five precious grandchildren.
