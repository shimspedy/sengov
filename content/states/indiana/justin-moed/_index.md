Justin Moed was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 2012. He serves as the Democratic Whip in the Indiana House of Representatives and is the ranking minority member of the Public Policy Committee. Moed also serves on the Local Government and Agriculture and Rural Development committees.

Moed began his work at the Statehouse as a doorkeeper and worked his way up to senior policy analyst before deciding to run for office.

Thanks to years of experience as a staff member in the Indiana legislature, Moed understands both the challenges and possibilities that come with state government. Since being elected, he has worked to put people and solutions first. His focus is on strengthening neighborhoods and helping his constituents navigate the ins-and-outs of government to solve problems.

Moed is known to work across party lines to find common ground on important issues such as economic development, tackling the abandoned housing crisis, holding government accountable, and promoting mass transit.

Moed is a graduate of Butler University and a homeowner on the south side of Indianapolis. He is highly involved with the local community, and owns and manages an urban farm. He is an active member of many community groups and organizations, as well as an appointed member of the IUPUI Board of Advisors, the White River State Park Commission and the State Tourism Council.
