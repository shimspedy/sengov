Schaibley was born and raised in Floyds Knobs, Ind. She graduated from Purdue University where she majored in political science and social studies education.

She remained active in the community, volunteered for various organizations and sat on the Board of Trustees of the Orchard School for six years.

Before joining the legislature, Schaibley was a substitute teacher in the Carmel Clay Schools where she focused on special education students. She and her husband John live in Carmel and have two children and three grandchildren.
