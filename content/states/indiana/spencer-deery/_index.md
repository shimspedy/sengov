State Sen. Spencer Deery assumed office in 2022 after successfully securing his first elected position. Representing Senate District 23, he covers Fountain, Parke, Vermillion, and Warren counties, along with portions of Montgomery and Tippecanoe counties in the Indiana State Senate.

Within the Senate, Deery actively contributes to various committees, including Commerce and Technology; Education and Career Development; Insurance and Financial Institutions; and Utilities.

Growing up in a rural community, Deery is the son of an elementary school principal and a public school teacher. He and his wife, Julia, have been married for over 16 years, residing in Tippecanoe County where they are raising three children attending public schools.

Deery's professional background includes working in the President’s Office of Purdue University from 2011 to 2022, where he served as deputy chief of staff and a communications and public policy advisor to Mitch Daniels. Currently, he works for the Purdue Research Foundation. His previous experience also encompasses roles in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington D.C., as well as private sector positions in marketing and strategic communications.

Fluent in Spanish, Deery holds a bachelor’s degree in communications with minors in business and political science. He earned a master’s degree from the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration at The George Washington University, graduating at the top of his class.

Active in Boy Scouts during his upbringing, Deery achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, an experience he credits with instilling in him a strong belief in the American experiment, the wisdom of the U.S. Constitution, and the importance of duty, honor, and integrity.

Beyond his professional and civic commitments, Deery enjoys coaching youth basketball and teaches a youth Sunday School class. His wife, Julia, directs a large preschool in West Lafayette and is actively involved in leading a women’s organization at their church.
