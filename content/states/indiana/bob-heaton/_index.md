State Rep. Bob Heaton was born in 1956 in Clay County, Ind. He grew up on a classic rural Hoosier farm that has been in the Heaton family for over 120 years. There he grew up with his mother, father, two brothers and one sister.

His father, Forrest, was an employee of Public Service Company of Indiana (now Cinergy) for over 30 years and was also a part-time farmer. Heaton’s mother, Betty, was a homemaker. He attended Cory Elementary School and then Clay City High School, where he was a star basketball player for the Clay City Eels.

After high school, Heaton attended the University of Denver on a full athletic scholarship (basketball) and studied business. After two years there, he transferred to Indiana State University, where played on the Sycamores basketball team.

Heaton played for the Sycamores from 1978 to 1980. He also played alongside Larry Bird in ISU’s famous 1978-1979 season, where they played for their only NCAA Division I Championship.

Heaton graduated from ISU with a bachelor’s degree in business administration and a concentration in marketing. He immediately was recruited by Northwestern Mutual (in Terre Haute) and served as a financial representative.

After his tenure with Northwestern Mutual, Heaton was hired by the Forrest-Sherer Agency. Since 2003, he has been president of his own financial service venture, Heaton Financial Services, in Terre Haute.

Heaton and his wife, Jane Ann, have one child and five grandchildren, all living in the Wabash Valley. His son, Travis Heaton, a Purdue graduate, passed away July 21, 2014. Heaton and his wife attend Union Christian Church in Terre Haute.

He has called the Wabash Valley home his entire life and has proudly served on several community organization boards: Terre Haute Convention and Visitors Bureau, Terre Haute Boys and Girls Club, and Wabash Valley Youth for Christ. Heaton was also a Leadership Terre Haute Class 5 member.
