State Representative Tim O'Brien has served as state representative for House District 78, which includes portions of Vanderburgh and Warrick counties, since 2021. O'Brien earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics as a University Honors Scholar at the University of Southern Indiana in 2015.

As a member of the House Ways and Means committee, O'Brien played a key role in advancing new laws that keep Indiana's fiscal outlook strong, including legislation to drop the state's individual income tax from 3.23% to 2.9% and eliminate the utility receipts tax. The law, which O'Brien co-authored, also returned $545 million to Hoosiers through a one-time automatic taxpayer refund.



Oâ€™Brien serves as Vice Chairman of the House Government and Regulatory Reform committee and is a member of the Financial Institutions committee.  

In 2022, he authored a law requiring school boards to allow for public comment at meetings, ensuring the voices of Hoosier parents will always be heard. The law passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.

O'Brien is a real estate broker and in 2019, he became the youngest president of the Southwest Indiana Association of Realtors at age 26. Currently, O'Brien regularly serves his community through volunteering, and on the City of Evansville Land Bank Corporation, and as Chairman of the Board at Heritage Federal Credit Union.

O'Brien lives and works in Evansville.
