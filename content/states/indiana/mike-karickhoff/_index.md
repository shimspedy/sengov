State Rep. Mike Karickhoff, first elected in 2010, has been an active member of his community for 35 years. During the 2022 session, Karickhoff authored a bill aimed to help Indiana communities rejoin a multi-state lawsuit against pharmaceutical companies that contributed to the opioid crisis. This new law helps Hoosiers gain additional settlement funds that go toward opioid-related programming, fighting the drug crisis, supporting local law enforcement and drug task forces, and bolstering treatment and preventative care.  

In Kokomo, he served seven years on the Kokomo Common Council as the Finance Chair and President. Karickhoff and his wife, Kelly have four daughters and 10 grandchildren. They worship at Northview Church in Kokomo.
