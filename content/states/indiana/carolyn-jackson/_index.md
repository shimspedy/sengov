State Representative Carolyn B. Jackson represents Indiana House District 1 in the General Assembly. She was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives on Nov. 6, 2018.

Jackson serves as Assistant Democratic Whip for the Indiana House Democrats. She is also a member of the Environmental Affairs Committee; the Family, Children and Human Affairs Committee; and the Natural Resources Committee.

On Nov. 20, 2018, Rep. Jackson was named chaplain of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus.

While working on her master's degree, she interned with the Cole County Juvenile Attention Center as a juvenile officer. Her main focus in that position was to protect the rights of children. As a practicing sociologist and counselor, Jackson pursued a career with the Cook County Adult Probation Department retiring with 30 years of service.

Jackson is a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother. She and her husband Eric have two sons, Eric II and Thomas.

Carolyn has always been a strong advocate for volunteerism.

Carolyn was a former adult probation officer and supervisor, past president of the board of directors for the Community Center Development Corporation (Ophelia Steen Family and Health Services Center) and Hammond Library Advisory Board.

She is currently affiliated with the Hammond Branch of the NAACP, Northwest Indiana League of Women Voters Calumet Area, Hammond High Parent/Teachers Advisory Board and the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.

In her spare time, Jackson enjoys her favorite activities: downhill skiing, golfing, gardening and traveling.
