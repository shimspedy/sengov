Blake Johnson was selected on June 27, 2020 to fill a vacancy in District 100 of the Indiana House of Representatives. He previously served as a member of the Indianapolis City-County Council.

Johnson serves as ranking Democrat on the Rules and Legislative Procedures Committee and the Local Government Committee. He is also a member of the Public Policy, Roads and Transportation, and Commerce, Small Business and Economic Development committees and the Committee on Joint Rules.

During his time on the City-County Council, he spearheaded more than $1 billion in capital investment across his district, and was selected by Mayor Joe Hogsett to help lead an education task force that produced the city's Indy Achieves Scholarship Program. During his tenure, he served as Chairman of the influential Administration and Finance Committee, which oversees the $1 billion City-County Budget on an annual basis.

As a legislator, Johnson has focused on supporting transit, increasing educational attainment and pursuing talent initiatives.

Additionally, Blake owns a small consulting firm focused on communications and talent strategy.

He and his wife, Natalie, live in the Fletcher Place neighborhood near downtown with their dogs, Jack and Jamison.
