State Representative Ryan Dvorak represents Indiana House District 8, which covers portions of South Bend and northern St. Joseph County. The district includes the campuses of the University of Notre Dame, St. Mary’s, and Holy Cross Colleges.

Dvorak currently serves as a member of the Rules and Legislative Procedures Committee, the Natural Resources Committee and the Judiciary Committee.

Dvorak has been recognized across the state as a leading legislative expert on renewable energy policy, authoring groundbreaking legislation on net metering, renewable energy standards, and enforcing accountability for utility companies. He has also drafted new laws to keep drunk drivers off the roads, crack down on methamphetamine production, and grow jobs in our state—including the first “Buy Indiana” law. Dvorak has also been a co-author of bipartisan laws to improve the “Do Not Call” statute, improve historic preservation efforts in Indiana, create benefit corporations, update the St. Joseph River Basin Commission, increase penalties for public corruption, and develop official recognition and cooperation between the State of Indiana and the Pokagon Band of Pottawatomi.

Dvorak continues to fight for public health and environmental protection, drafting bills to curb toxic pollution and set aside land for conservation and public use.  He also remains committed to better wages and more sick time for workers, and college affordability, so everyone who wishes can afford a quality education without being burdened by excessive debt.

Dvorak has been a Michiana “Forty Under 40” honoree, recognized by the Hoosier Chapter of the Sierra Club for Outstanding Achievement, and named Legislator of the Year by both the Indiana Aviation Association and the Indiana Conservation Alliance.

Dvorak was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 2002.  Prior to his election to the Indiana House of Representatives, he served as a senior aide to Congressman Tim Roemer.  Dvorak received a bachelor’s degree in Philosophy from the University of Notre Dame and a law degree from the Indiana University McKinney School of Law.

Dvorak and his wife, Angie, live in South Bend with their three children.
