State Rep. Denny Zent was elected to the Indiana General Assembly in 2012 and represents House District 51, which includes most of LaGrange and Steuben counties. As a veteran of the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force, Zent is focused on helping Indianaâ€™s men and women in uniform.

Zent brings years of medical experience and expertise to the House of Representatives as a retired endodontist, having spent his career helping Hoosiers.

He is focused on implementing laws to help Hoosiers receive the training and opportunities they need to bridge the skills gap for the jobs of tomorrow. He also hopes to continue the efforts of building a pro-business environment to attract high-quality jobs to Indiana.

Zent and his wife, Wendy, have two children and happily reside in Angola.
