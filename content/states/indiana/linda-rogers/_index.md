Additionally, she is a member of several other Senate Committees, including Education and Career Development; Elections; Family and Children Services; and Tax and Fiscal Policy.

With a career spanning nearly four decades in the Michiana area, Rogers is an accomplished small business owner and leader. She operates Juday Creek Golf Course and Nugent Builders, Inc., a custom home builder. Throughout her career, she has made significant contributions to the community, including being the first female President of the Home Builders Association of St. Joseph Valley and a member of the Indiana Golf Course Owners Association. Notably, Rogers is the only woman to have been elected President of both the Indiana Builders Association and the National Golf Course Owners Association.
