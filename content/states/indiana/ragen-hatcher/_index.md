State Rep. Ragen Hatcher represents Indiana House District 3 in the General Assembly. She was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives on Nov. 6, 2018.

Hatcher is the ranking minority member of the Commerce, Small Business and Economic Development Committee and also serves on the Courts and Criminal Code and Government and Regulatory Reform committees.

Hatcher served as an at-large member of the Gary City Council from 2007 to 2011, when she ran unsuccessfully for Gary mayor. Voters returned her to the Gary City Council in 2015.

Hatcher received a bachelor's degree in economics and law and a master's degree in administration from Valparaiso University, a master's degree in finance from Indiana University as well as teaching urban studies there; worked as a Lake County deputy prosecutor; and was elected to the Gary City Council in 2007 and 2015.

Her father, Richard G. Hatcher, made history 50 years ago when he was elected the first black mayor of a major American city.
