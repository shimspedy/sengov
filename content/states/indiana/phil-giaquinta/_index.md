A native of Fort Wayne, State Representative Phil GiaQuinta was born and raised in Indiana House District 80, which includes portions of south-central Fort Wayne.

GiaQuinta, who was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 2006, was elected Indiana House Democratic Caucus Leader on Nov. 7, 2018, and is ranking House minority member of the General Assembly's Committee on Joint Rules.

Keeping the folks and district he represents in mind, GiaQuinta authored successful legislation that created the funding for the Allen County-Fort Wayne Capital Improvement Board. The bill allowed for the board to use a portion of the revenue from county food and beverage taxes to fund new structures and renovate old ones, like the Electric Works project. This funding has helped to create many good paying jobs for the community.

To streamline the home- buying process for Hoosiers, GiaQuinta authored a law in 2008 that allowed for the sales disclosure to also be used as an application for the homestead tax credit, eliminating duplicate paperwork and multiple visits to the auditor’s office.

GiaQuinta currently works as a customer account manager for Fort Wayne City Utilities. He earned his black belt in Six Sigma for reducing the average hold time for City Utilities customers. He started Fort Wayne’s successful 3-1-1 call center, a one-stop shop for city services.

GiaQuinta is currently a trustee of the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum and serves on the IU Fort Wayne Advisory Board, the City of Fort Wayne Summit City Entrepreneur and Enterprise District (SEED) Board, the Alliance Health Centers Board, and the Brightpoint Board. In the past, GiaQuinta has served on many boards for organizations such as Community Harvest Food Bank and Blue Jacket. He also formerly served as an elected member to the Wayne Township Advisory Board.

He graduated from Leadership Fort Wayne, a program that instructs and encourages individuals to become active leaders within the community. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Indiana University. GiaQuinta is the past recipient of a Legislator of the Year award from both the Indiana Trial Lawyers and the Indiana Chamber of Commerce.

GiaQuinta is the son of former State Representative Ben GiaQuinta. He is the youngest of six children and proud uncle to 16 nieces and nephews.
