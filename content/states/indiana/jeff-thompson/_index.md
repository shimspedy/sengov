Under his leadership in drafting the school funding formula, the General Assembly has changed from funding school corporations to funding students.

Thompson started at a young age working on his family farm. He put himself through Purdue by operating a hay-baling business. During the next 20 years, he co-managed and operated their several hundred-acre livestock and crop farm. Since 2000, Thompson has continued his involvement in agriculture with a small hay and straw business.

Thompson is a North Salem High School alumnus and graduated from Purdue University in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science in physics. He spent more than 30 years in education, teaching chemistry, physics and math at Danville Community High School.

In 2000, Thompson joined North Salem State Bank as an advisory director. In 2008, he was elected board director. He currently serves as vice chair of the board and has chaired the Loan, Compliance and Assets/Liabilities (ALCO) committees.
