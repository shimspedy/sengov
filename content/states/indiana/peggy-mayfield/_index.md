Peggy Mayfield was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 2012, serving District 60, which includes portions of Johnson, Morgan and Monroe counties. She is vice chair of the House Public Policy Committee and serves on the House Insurance Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee, which is tasked with drafting the state's biennial budget. She is also appointed to serve on the Indiana Commission for Women and the Indiana Commission for Hispanic and Latino Affairs.

Mayfieldâ€™s legislative efforts span a variety of subjects. She has earned awards for her work on bills in areas of education, economic development, veterans' issues, law enforcement and protection of the unborn.

As a certified rifle and shotgun instructor, competitive shooter, hunter, lifetime member of the National Rifle Association and other advocacy organizations, Mayfield is a strong voice in the General Assembly on matters concerning our Second Amendment rights.

For over three decades, she and her husband Dean have owned Mayfield Insurance, an independent insurance agency in Mooresville. They are active members of multiple local Chambers of Commerce and industry professional associations.

Peggy and Dean live in Martinsville and have four sons. After more than two decades of volunteer service with Boy Scouts of America, she vacated her position on the executive board of Hoosier Trails Council but remains active in their local troop, where three sons earned their Eagle Scout award. She is a recipient of the BSA District Award of Merit and a member of the Order of the Arrow.

The Mayfields have also enjoyed being a host family to numerous exchange students from around the world. In addition, two of her sons have been Rotary exchange students to Taipei, Taiwan; one in 2008 and the other in 2011.
