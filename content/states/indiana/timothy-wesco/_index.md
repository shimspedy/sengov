State Rep. Timothy Wesco was born and raised in Northern Indiana, where he grew up on land once farmed by his great grandfather, Virgil Culp. In high school, Wesco got his first job making minimum wage at the family piano building business, Walter Piano Co., in Elkhart.

At age 19, Wesco did what so many others from Elkhart have done; he got a job working in a RV factory. Along the way, he joined his township fire department and become involved in public service with the Young Republicans as an outlet for his passionate beliefs in limited government, personal responsibility and fiscal integrity.

Wesco has served as state representative since 2010. He has remained true to the principles of limited government, personal responsibility and fiscal integrity upon which he was elected.

Wesco is a graduate of Bethel College with a BS degree in organizational management.

In 2013, Wesco married his wife, Kathryn, and they reside just outside the town of Osceola.
