State Rep. Bob Behning has served in the Indiana House of Representatives since 1992 and represents House District 91, which includes a portion of Marion County. He was born and raised in Indianapolis and has been a proud Hoosier his entire life. In 1976, he received a Bachelor of Science degree from Indiana University.

Throughout his tenure as a representative, he has advocated for education reform in Indiana. As chair of the House Education Committee, he led a multiyear effort to successfully pass the most comprehensive education reform package in the United States.

Behning believes all parents deserve the right to choose the school that best meets their child's needs. In 2011, Behning authored legislation creating the School Choice Scholarship program, providing families who do not have the financial means to pay the cost of tuition at a private school with a scholarship (or voucher). Indiana currently has the largest school voucher program in the United States.

Behning currently works at Marian University as the assistant vice president and director of the Center for Vibrant Schools. He has been married to his wife, Rosalie, for more than 40 years and enjoys spending time with his children and grandchildren.
