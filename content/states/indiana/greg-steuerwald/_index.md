Gregory Steuerwald, a member of the Republican Party, serves in the Indiana House of Representatives, representing District 40. He assumed office in 2007, and his current term is set to conclude on November 6, 2024.

Prior to attending law school, Steuerwald utilized his Masters in Criminal Justice by serving as a probation officer for two years. While attending Indiana University-Indianapolis, he served as an intern in the Hendricks County Prosecutor's Office. Upon graduation from law school, he joined his present law firm and has been there since 1981.

His firm has represented various units of local government including towns, libraries and townships. This includes the Hendricks County Board of Commissioners, the Hendricks County Plan Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals, the Hendricks County Health Department, Hendricks Regional Health and the Hendricks County Solid Waste Management District.

In 1996, Steuerwald received the Hendricks County Outstanding Economic Development Award. He is a certified probation officer with the State of Indiana Department of Corrections. He is also a registered mediator and received a Certificate of Recognition in Family Mediation Training through the Indiana Continuing Legal Education Forum.

Steuerwald has focused on implementing laws to keep Hoosiers safe. He authored the law providing the foundation for a revision of Indiana's criminal code, which had not been revised in over 30 years. The new code provides for certainty in sentencing and keeps the most violent offenders in prison longer. He also worked to tighten loopholes in the state's sex registry to ensure offenders report any changes in address or appearance to the local authorities.

Steuerwald was born on Sept. 12, 1952, in Terre Haute, Indiana. He resides in Avon with his wife, Christy. He has three grown children: Joshua Garver, D.D.S.; Jordan Gorgievski, and Adam Steuerwald.
