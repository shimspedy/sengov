State Representative Tonya Pfaff represents Indiana House District 43 in the General Assembly. She was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives on Nov. 6, 2018.

Pfaff is the ranking Democrat on the Elections and Apportionment Committee. She also serves on the budget-writing Ways and Means Committee as well as the Education Committee.

Pfaff is the only daughter of Nancy and Fred Nation. With three brothers, she grew up in a highly competitive family, whether it be in academics, sports or community service. Tonya's elementary education was at St. Ann School, where one of her teachers was her mother, Nancy, who inspired her to become a teacher.

Pfaff and her husband Chris have four children. While raising this active family in Terre Haute, Pfaff has continued her career, teaching math for 28 years, three at South, 15 at West and she is now in her 10th year at North.

Pfaff is committed to the ideals of family, education and service as the foundation of a strong community. Her legislative goals include helping to address public education challenges in Indiana and bringing greater economic development to Terre Haute and West Terre Haute.
