Born and raised in the Wabash Valley, Bruce Borders represents his home community in the Statehouse. He was valedictorian of his class at Shakamak High School. He and his wife Lola have three children and five grandchildren. Borders is a hard-working local businessman, dedicated family man and active member and Royal Rangers teacher at First Assembly of God in Jasonville.
