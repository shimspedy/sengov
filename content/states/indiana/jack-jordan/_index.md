Jack Jordan is an American politician serving as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives for the 17th district. He assumed office on November 9, 2016, succeeding Timothy Harman.

Born and raised on a small farm in the Bremen, Indiana area, Jordan graduated from Bremen High School in 1979. He went on to study industrial management at Purdue University for one year and earned a Bachelor of Science from Liberty University in 1984. He also completed a one-year program in Industrial Management Studies from Purdue University and received his MBA from Purdue University's Krannert Graduate School of Management.

Before his political career, Jordan worked as a business consultant for the pharmaceutical industry and start-ups. He was a partner for a home construction and renovation company, and served as a member of the board of directors for Bremen Castings, Inc. Jordan also has experience in the nonprofit industry with Initiatives in Romania, the India Scholarship Initiative, the Leadership Marshall County, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

In 2016, Jordan was elected for the 17th district of the Indiana House of Representatives. During his tenure, he has served on several key House committees. In 2022, he supported a $1 billion tax relief for Hoosiers, the largest tax-cut package in state history. The legislation lowered the state's income tax and eliminated the utility receipts tax.

Jordan's commitment to fiscal integrity and economic growth has been a driving force in his service to Indiana's 17th district.
