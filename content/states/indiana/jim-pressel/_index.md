State Representative Jim Pressel owns and operates Pressel Enterprises Inc., a small business that builds and remodels residential homes throughout Northwest Indiana. He is an active member of the Indiana Builders Association and served as its president in 2016.

A Rolling Prairie resident for the last 30 years, Pressel is an active member of his community. In 2003, he helped start the building trades program at New Prairie High School and continues to serve on the board. This program gives students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in building structures to prepare them with the skills needed for the workforce.

Pressel, born and raised in rural LaPorte County, is married to his wife, Rebecca, and they have two children and three grandchildren.
