State Rep. Chuck Goodrich of Noblesville was first elected to serve the constituents of House District 29 in 2018. During his first year in office, Goodrich authored a bill that created the senior-youth mentor pilot program, which aims to provide struggling students with a role model at school. This legislation passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support.

He also co-sponsored a new law that aimed to meet the changing needs of Indianaâ€™s employers by reallocating existing state funds to proven workforce programs so Hoosiers can increase their certifications, earn stackable credentials and secure higher-paying jobs in high-demand fields.

Outside of the legislature, Goodrich serves as the president and CEO of Gaylor Electric, Inc. The electrical design-build contractor employs more than 1,300 men and women throughout 11 offices in five states across the county, including seven Indiana locations. During his tenure, Gaylor Electric created more than 700 jobs.

He also helped open the Gaylor Electric Crossing School of Business and Entrepreneurship Satellite Campus, an alternative, state-accredited high school for at-risk students at the Gaylor Noblesville hub. He actively works with the Hamilton County Workforce Innovation Network and is a member of the Indiana Department of Workforce Development's Region 5 Workforce Development Board.

Goodrich lives in Noblesville with his wife of 25 years, Tricia, and their four children. The family is active in the community and as members of the White River Christian Church. He enjoys spending quality time with his wife and kids, playing golf, and rooting for the Indianapolis Colts and Purdue Boilermakers.
