State Representative Ryan Hatfield serves as the Assistant Leader for the Indiana House Democrats. He serves as the ranking minority member of the Indiana House Judiciary and Employment, Labor and Pensions committees. Ryan is also a member of the Public Health and Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications committees.

Hatfield has served as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives, representing his hometown of Evansville, since 2016. He is a lawyer at Hatfield Law Office, LLC in Evansville and an adjunct faculty member at Ivy Tech Community College.

Prior to serving in the Indiana General Assembly and joining the law firm, Hatfield was a deputy prosecutor in Vanderburgh County, where he prosecuted homicides, sexual assaults and drug offenses. During his tenure, Hatfield secured one of Indiana’s first convictions alleging Munchausen Syndrome by proxy. As a member of the Vanderburgh County Treatment Court, as well as the Veterans Court, he worked to transition drug-addicted offenders into rehabilitation and back into their community. He also served as an instructor at the Southwest Indiana Law Enforcement Academy.

Hatfield serves as a Commissioner of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, an organization that provides states with nonpartisan legislation that brings clarity and stability to critical areas of state statutory law. His legal expertise, competency, professional reputation, and ethical standards have earned him distinctions such as Rue’s Ratings’ Best Attorneys of America®, Top 10% in the USA by Lawyers of Distinction, and The National Trial Lawyers Top 40 Under 40. In 2018, Rep. Hatfield was recognized by Indiana Farm Bureau as an Emerging Leader.

Ryan’s wife, Kendra, is a pediatric registered nurse at St. Vincent’s Evansville. The Hatfields are active on local boards and committees, particularly for the protection and care of children.
