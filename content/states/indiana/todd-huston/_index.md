Todd Huston of Fishers was first elected in 2012 as state representative for the constituents of House District 37, which includes a portion of Hamilton County. Huston was first selected by House members to serve as Indiana House Speaker in 2020 and he currently leads the 100-member chamber, including the 70-member Republican supermajority.

Thanks in part to Huston's strong push for tax cuts during the 2023 legislative session, taxpayers are expected to save an estimated $430 million over the next two years via tax relief. Thanks to the acceleration of individual state income tax cuts, hardworking Hoosiers will have one of the lowest rates in the nation by 2027. In 2022, Huston spearheaded the passage of a $1 billion tax-relief package to support hardworking Hoosiers â€“ the largest tax cut in state history. The law also lowered utility bills for Hoosiers and businesses by eliminating the 1.46% Utility Receipts Tax paid on electricity, natural gas, water, steam, sewage and telephone bills.

Indiana's new budget continues significant investments in K-12 education as student funding support will increase by 10% over the next two years. In addition, parents no longer pay textbook and curricular fees. Huston successfully led efforts to substantially expand school choice, and now nearly all Hoosier families can send their child to the school that best meets their needs. Huston received the 2021 Champion of School Choice Award from the Institute for Quality Education for supporting a significant expansion of Indiana's Choice Scholarship program.

Huston helped lead the creation of the Regional Economic Acceleration and Development Initiative (READI) in 2021 with a $500 million investment to promote community collaboration and growth. On average, every dollar provided by the state has been matched with $26 from outside entities that will attract and develop talent and enhance the quality of life of current and future generations of Hoosiers. In 2023, he supported directing another $500 million to support READI 2.0. Through this transformative program, regions created a strong vision for the future and applied for competitive grants.  In total, READI will create an economic investment of over $13 billion for communities across Indiana.

Huston previously served on the Hamilton Southeastern School Board, Hamilton Southeastern Schools Foundation Board, Fishers Planning Commission and Indiana Leadership Forum Board of Directors. Additionally, former Gov. Mitch Daniels twice called on Huston to serve the state, first with a four-year term as a member of the Indiana State Board of Education, and from 2006 to 2009 as a member of the Indiana Education Roundtable.

Huston and his wife, Denise, reside in Fishers and have two adult children, Elizabeth and Jake.
