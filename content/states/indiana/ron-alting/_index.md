State Sen. Ron Alting, born and raised in Lafayette, has had a rich and varied life, dedicating himself to public service and entrepreneurship. A proud graduate of Lafayette Jefferson High School, Alting achieved recognition by being inducted into the school’s hall of fame in 2001. His athletic prowess was showcased as a member of the 1974 Lafayette Jefferson High School state finals basketball team.

Alting commenced his college journey at Greenville University in Greenville, Illinois, where he distinguished himself as the vice president of his class. Continuing his education at Purdue University, he earned a bachelor’s degree. During his time at Purdue, he served as the program director for the YMCA in Lafayette for three years. Following graduation, Alting ventured into entrepreneurship, owning restaurants, nightclubs, and various other businesses throughout his life.

In 1995, Alting transitioned to a career in public service by joining the Lafayette City Council. His leadership skills were evident as he served as council president until 1998 when he was elected to represent Senate District 22 in the Indiana State Senate. This district comprises all of Carroll County and portions of Tippecanoe County. As the most senior member of the Indiana Senate, Alting has been a steadfast advocate for his constituents.

In 2011, Alting took on the role of chair of the Senate Committee on Public Policy, presiding over significant legislation that has impacted the lives of Hoosiers across the state. He has also contributed to the National Conference of State Legislators Education Committee.

Alting's dedication to public service has not gone unnoticed, as evidenced by his nine-time recognition as “Legislator of the Year” and four-time receipt of the prestigious Indiana American Legion Distinguished Public Service award – the most by any currently serving state legislator.
