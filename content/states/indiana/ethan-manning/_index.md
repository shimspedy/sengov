State Rep. Ethan Manning was first elected to serve House District 23 in 2018. He currently serves as the chair of the House Public Policy Committee and a member of the House Employment, Labor and Pensions Committee.

In 2014, Manning was elected to the Miami County Council and served as council president from 2016 through 2018. In this role, he served on the Miami County Economic Development Elected Officials Council, as chair of the Miami County Budget Committee and the Incentive Review Committee, on the Miami County Plan Commission, and several other local bodies. In 2015, Manning was appointed by former Gov. Mike Pence to serve on the Indiana State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers. He served as board president in 2018 and worked with fellow members to administer licensing for the 12,000 professional engineers registered in Indiana.

Manning holds two professional licenses and works as a real estate broker and auctioneer. He also works on his family farm, Manning Cattle Company, with his grandfather, father and brother. They raise commercial angus beef cattle, corn and hay.

Manning enjoys volunteering as an auctioneer for charitable causes and is a member of the Peru Rotary Club and the Grissom Community Council. He and his wife Bridget, who is a physician at Logansport Memorial Hospital, live in rural Cass County with their two dogs, River and Red.
