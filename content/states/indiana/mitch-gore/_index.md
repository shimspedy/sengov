After spending his entire life on Indianapolis' East and Southeast sides, State Representative Mitch Gore is a recognized community advocate, small business operator and public safety professional.

Mitch is the ranking minority member of the Courts and Criminal Code Committee. He also serves on the Veterans Affairs and Public Safety Committee and the Roads and Transportation Committee.

Mitch worked hard to keep his family's Washington Square restaurant afloat during the Great Recession while also attending the University of Indianapolis. As a product of public schools and a working family, Mitch knows what it's like to work hard for positive results.

Having worked in the area of community development, Mitch has sought to eliminate blight in our neighborhoods, demolish unsafe buildings, and crack down on slum lords.

Mitch is currently a Captain with the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He believes in compassionate policing and knows that the best way to keep everyone safe is for law enforcement to respect the people they serve, thereby earning the people's trust.

When he isnâ€™t out in his community advocating for his neighbors, Mitch can be found with his wife, Brittany, walking their dog, Daisy, and rooting for the Pacers, Colts and Butler Bulldogs.
