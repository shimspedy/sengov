State Representative Bob Cherry has had the opportunity to serve the State of Indiana in many ways since elected as state representative for House District 53. He became a member of the General Assembly in 1998 after developing an interest in public policy and a desire to represent the people of District 53.

During the 2013 legislative session, Cherry co-sponsored Senate Enrolled Act (SEA) 319, which prevented an estimated tax increase of $57 million for farmland across the state. To the relief of countless Hoosiers, the soil productivity factors used for the March 2011 assessment of agricultural land remained in place for property taxes payable in 2014.

As the Vice Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, Cherry was involved in creating and passing the state budget in 2013. Without overspending, the budget increased K-12 education funding by $390 million over the biennium and allotted $215 million per year for roads and bridges. The budget also contained a blend of tax relief including the immediate elimination of the Death Tax, reduction of the Financial Institutions tax, continued corporate income tax reduction and phased in income tax cut of 5%. In addition to the state budget, Cherry also supported measures that brought tax incentives to businesses looking to locate in Indiana as a way to grow the Hoosier economy.

Cherry remains equally as involved in his local community in Hancock and Madison counties. He previously served as a Hancock County Councilman and as a member of both the Hancock County Planning Commission and Greenfield Board of Zoning Appeals. He was appointed by the governor to the State Board of Tax Commissioners and is the former Chair of the Agricultural Advisory Council. He is a member of the Elks, Kiwanis Club, Masonic Lodge, Murat Shrine and Farm Bureau. In August of 2007, Cherry received a 33rd Degree in Scottish Rite. Cherry also serves on the Whitewater State Park Commission and the Indiana State Fair Advisory Committee

He has received numerous “Legislator of the Year” awards from various organizations, including the Credit Union, Small Businesses and the Conservation Officers. Cherry was also the recipient of the outstanding Purdue Alumni in Animal Science in 2007. He received the Master Farmer award from Prairie Farmer magazine and Purdue University in 2022.  He received his B.S. from Purdue University and remains involved in Boilermaker activities.

Cherry and his wife Deborah have five grown children: Keegan, Kevin, Kathee, Stephanie and Jared. They also have 12 grandchildren. Cherry is a member of the Greenfield Christian Church. He and Deb live and work on their family farm near Greenfield.
