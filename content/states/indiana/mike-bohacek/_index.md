State Sen. Mike Bohacek has been serving the constituents of Senate District 8 since 2016. This district includes Starke County and portions of LaPorte, Marshall, and St. Joseph counties.

Bohacek actively contributes to legislative matters as a member of the Senate Committees on Corrections and Criminal Law; Health and Provider Services; and Local Government.

A strong advocate for the safety of Hoosier children, Bohacek utilizes his position as a senator to author multiple bills aimed at protecting victims of rape and abuse. His commitment to this cause was recognized when he was named Legislator of the Year in 2022 by the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneyâ€™s Council for his work in clarifying the definition of rape.

Before entering the Senate, Bohacek served as a Michiana Shores town councilman and as a LaPorte County commissioner. Academically, he holds degrees in both finance and economics from DePaul University. Professionally, Bohacek is an enterprise consultant and owner of MSL Services Inc.

Residing in Michiana Shores with his wife, Melissa, Bohacek is the proud parent of three daughters.
