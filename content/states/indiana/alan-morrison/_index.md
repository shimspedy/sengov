State Rep. Alan Morrison was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 2012 serving District 42, which includes all of Parke and Vermillion counties, and portions of Clay, Fountain and Vigo counties. He is chair of the House Environmental Affairs Committee and vice chair of the House Elections and Apportionment Committee. He also serves on the House Natural Resources and Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications committees.

Morrison attended Slippery Rock University, where he earned his bachelor’s degree, and later attended Indiana State University for his master’s degree, both in sports management. He began his professional career working for the Flint Generals, a minor league hockey team in Flint, Mich., as a corporate sales account executive. He continued his career in Indiana working for Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology for 14 years in the Student Affairs Development Office before serving as a state representative.

Morrison has resided in West Central Indiana with his two kids, Katelyn and Derek, since 2001 and remains active in his community by participating in local events.

His legislative efforts over the past several years have centered on energy and utility issues, local and statewide road funding, school safety and gaming.
