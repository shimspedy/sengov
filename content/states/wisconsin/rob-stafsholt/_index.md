Rob Stafsholt has lived in St. Croix County since birth. He attended New Richmond Public Schools for his K-12 education and still resides on his family's farm near New Richmond. After graduating from New Richmond High School, Rob began his college education at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire majoring in Business Administration with an emphasis in Communication and a minor in History. While at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire, Rob was a key member of a small group of students that organized the first UW Rod & Gun Club on campus. He was the first President of the club and served on the Executive Board of Directors for the remainder of his time at the University.

Rob then purchased a home on the family farm in New Richmond and transferred to the University of Wisconsin - River Falls where he continued his education - double majoring in Business Administration and Farm Management, as well as double minors in History and Communication. Rob has been self-employed much of his life - as a family farmer, owner of a waste disposal company, a salesman then co-owner of the family's salad and food dressing company, and in real estate starting his own investing and residential rental business. But Rob has also been an employee for different companies in positions such as a tow truck driver, guide on outdoor recreation trips, commercial carpet removal, factory worker at McMillan Electric in Woodville, and was also a loan officer for a mortgage company for several years.

Today, in addition to working in the Legislature, Rob continues to farm with his father and run his waste disposal business. Rob is an active member of his community and participates in many important organizations. He is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, member of the Farm Bureau, member of the New Richmond Chamber of Commerce, and is a current member and was a longtime member of the Board of Directors for the Wisconsin Bear Hunters Association. The most important thing in Rob’s life is his daughter Maggie, who is currently in her sophomore year in college. He is an avid outdoorsman and spends his free time hunting, fishing, trapping, and generally enjoying Wisconsin's beautiful natural resources. This is Senator Stafsholt’s fourth term in the Legislature where he is proud to be serving the people of Senate District 10.

Rob is currently on the Senate Committees on Financial Institutions and Sporting Heritage (Chair), Economic Development and Technical Colleges (Vice-Chair), and Housing, Rural Issues and Forestry.
