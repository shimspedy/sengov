Jamie Wall is a Democratic Party member serving in the Wisconsin State Senate, representing District 30. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 3, 2029.

Born and raised in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Jamie Wall has deep roots in the community he now represents. He grew up on his family’s dairy farm in the rural town of Holland, where he learned the values of hard work and community service. Wall graduated as valedictorian from Wrightstown High School in 1989 and went on to study political science and history at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. During his time there, he became actively involved in student government and even served as co-president in his senior year. His passion for public service was evident early on, as he campaigned for Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential election.

After earning his bachelor’s degree in 1993, Wall briefly interned in the Office of the Vice President of the United States. However, he had to cut his internship short due to his father’s illness. Following his father’s passing, Wall pursued further education and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1995, which allowed him to study at Oxford University in England. He completed his master’s degree there before embarking on a career in management consulting with McKinsey & Company in New York and later joining a technology startup in Silicon Valley.

In 2002, Wall returned to Wisconsin and co-founded a consulting firm in Green Bay, focusing on strategic planning and economic development. His commitment to his community extended beyond his professional endeavors, as he became involved in various local organizations, including serving as vice president of the Green Bay Water Commission and as a board member of the Wisconsin 4-H Foundation.

Wall’s political career began in earnest when he was appointed to lead the Division of Economic Development in the Wisconsin Department of Commerce under Governor Jim Doyle. In this role, he traveled extensively across the state, promoting economic initiatives and fostering growth. Although he faced setbacks in his bids for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006 and 2012, Wall’s dedication to public service never wavered.

As a state senator, Jamie Wall focuses on reducing the cost of living, improving public education, and addressing housing shortages in his district. His leadership is characterized by a commitment to collaboration and a belief that unity can drive meaningful change. Wall continues to work tirelessly to make Wisconsin a better place for all its residents.
