Jodene Emerson (born August 3, 1972) is an American activist and Democratic politician. She hails from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where she was born and raised. After graduating from Memorial High School, Emerson attended the University of Wisconsin–River Falls for two years before embarking on her journey as a family-oriented individual.

Emerson wears multiple hats: she's a devoted mother to two adult daughters, a former PTA president, and a Girl Scout troop leader. But her impact extends beyond her family and community roles. As an anti-trafficking advocate, she has made significant contributions in the fight against human trafficking.

Her professional journey includes serving as a legal assistant in a law office and working as the Director of Public Policy and Community Relations for Fierce Freedom—a nonprofit organization dedicated to combating human trafficking. Emerson's passion for this cause led her to champion several successful bipartisan pieces of legislation, including Senate Bill 344, Senate Bill 396, Senate Bill 618, Assembly Bill 16, Assembly Bill 186, Assembly Bill 435, and Act 367.

Notably, Emerson developed a statewide program to train hotel workers to recognize the signs of human trafficking. She also played a pivotal role in co-chairing the development of the statewide community response protocol on human trafficking. Her commitment to this critical issue led to her appointment to Wisconsin's Anti Human Trafficking Task Force in 2015.

In March 2018, Emerson announced her candidacy for District 91 of the Wisconsin State Assembly. Although the seat was previously held by Dana Wachs, who chose not to seek reelection due to his gubernatorial run, Emerson stepped up to the challenge. Her campaign garnered endorsements from EMILY's List, Fair Wisconsin, and other prominent organizations and individuals.

Currently, as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Emerson serves on several committees, including Aging and Long-Term Care, Colleges and Universities, Criminal Justice and Public Safety, Family Law, and International Affairs/Commerce.

Jodene Emerson's dedication to public service and her tireless efforts in combating human trafficking make her a remarkable figure in Wisconsin politics.
