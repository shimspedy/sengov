Gretchen Stephens "Greta" Neubauer is an American politician. Born on September 13, 1991, in Racine, Wisconsin, she has been a dedicated advocate for progressive causes for over a decade. Neubauer attended high school at The Prairie School in Wind Point, Wisconsin, where she helped organize Racine High School Students for Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign.

After graduating from Middlebury College in Vermont with a degree in history, Neubauer became the director of the nonprofit Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network, focusing on environmental issues. Her passion for public service led her to work as an aide in the office of then-Representative Cory Mason. When Mason resigned from the state Assembly in January 2018 to serve as Mayor of Racine, Neubauer declared her candidacy to fill his seat in the special election. She emerged victorious, representing the 66th district, which includes the city of Racine and southeastern Racine County.

Neubauer's commitment to climate change issues led to her appointment by Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers to the Governor's Task Force on Climate Change in 2019. In 2021, she was unanimously elected to serve as the minority leader of the Democratic caucus, making her part of the youngest legislative leadership team in Wisconsin history.

Outside of politics, Neubauer has a remarkable family background. Her father, Jeff Neubauer, is a former state legislator and chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, while her mother, Lisa Neubauer, serves as a judge on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. In a courageous op-ed in the Racine Journal Times in 2020, Neubauer came out as queer.

Rep. Neubauer continues to work tirelessly for her constituents, bridging perspectives from Racine County to Madison, and striving to build a brighter future for her community.
