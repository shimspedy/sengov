Randy Udell is a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 47th Assembly District. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end in January 2027.

Born in Beloit, Wisconsin, in 1961, Randy Udell grew up in a working-class family in Janesville. He attended public schools before pursuing higher education at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Whitewater, where he earned a degree in political science. During his time at university, Udell was actively involved in student government and political organizations, serving as a student senator and chairing the campus Young Democrats. His early political experiences included working for Representative Les Aspin and Maryland Attorney General Stephen Sachs.

Udell's career in public service began at the local level. He was first elected to the Fitchburg City Council in 2020, representing the 4th District. He served two terms on the council and chaired the finance committee, where he gained valuable experience in budgeting and financial planning. In 2023, he ran for mayor of Fitchburg but narrowly lost the election. Undeterred, he successfully ran for a seat on the Dane County Board of Supervisors in 2024, representing the 33rd District.

In addition to his local government roles, Udell has been an active member of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. He served as the party's treasurer from 2015 to 2024, overseeing a multi-million-dollar budget and contributing to the party's strategic planning efforts. His leadership within the party has been widely recognized and respected.

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Udell has focused on issues such as expanding broadband access to rural areas, addressing rising costs, and advocating for working families. His background as a telecommunications engineer and his extensive experience in finance have informed his legislative priorities and approach to problem-solving.

Randy Udell resides in Fitchburg, Wisconsin, with his husband, Brad, and their rescue dog, Morgan. In his free time, he enjoys hiking, reading, and exploring Wisconsin's natural beauty. A dedicated public servant, Udell continues to work tirelessly to represent the interests of his constituents and to advance policies that benefit the people of Wisconsin.
