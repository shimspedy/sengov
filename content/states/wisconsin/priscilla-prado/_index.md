Priscilla Prado is a Democratic Party member serving in the Wisconsin State Assembly. She represents the 9th District, having assumed office on January 6, 2025. Her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born Priscilla Ann Martinez on November 7, 1983, in Los Angeles, California, Priscilla Prado has built a remarkable career as an accountant, business owner, and politician. She moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as an adult and pursued her education at Milwaukee Area Technical College before earning a bachelor's degree in business administration from Alverno College. Her professional journey began in accounting, where she worked for prominent firms and organizations, including Michael Best & Friedrich LLP and Monster.com. Over time, she became deeply involved in providing tax preparation services for Spanish-speaking small business owners in the Milwaukee area. This passion led her to co-found Ambas Financial Services LLC in 2017 and later establish her own accounting business, Midwest Bookkeeping & Tax Solutions, in 2019.

Prado's dedication to her community extends beyond her professional endeavors. She has served on the board of the Wisconsin Latino Chamber of Commerce, contributing to the economic development of the Latino community. Her commitment to public service and advocacy for working families inspired her to enter politics. In 2024, she successfully ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 9th District, which includes much of Milwaukee's southwest side and is one of the state's majority-Hispanic districts.

Throughout her career, Priscilla Prado has been a strong advocate for financial stability, job creation, healthcare access, and resources for working families. Her resilience and determination, shaped by personal and professional challenges, have made her a respected leader in her community. As a mother of four, she balances her responsibilities with grace and continues to work tirelessly to empower her constituents and improve their quality of life.
