Deb Andraca (née Anderson; born April 10, 1970) is an American politician, public relations specialist, and educator. As a Democrat, she represents the 23rd district of the Wisconsin State Assembly. Her district includes three northeastern Milwaukee County suburbs—Whitefish Bay, Fox Point, and Bayside—as well as the village of Grafton and eastern portions of Mequon and the town of Grafton. Deb Andraca was elected to her first term in November 2020.

**Early Life and Education:**
Deb Andraca was born as Deborah Jane Anderson in Springfield, Massachusetts. She later moved with her parents to Pennsylvania. She graduated from Manheim Township High School in 1988 and went on to earn her bachelor's degree from Syracuse University in 1992. After completing her undergraduate studies, she moved to Washington, D.C., where she worked for the Solar Energy Industries Association, a non-profit trade association promoting the solar energy industry in the United States. During this time, she also pursued her master's degree in political management at George Washington University.

**Early Career:**
Deb's career took her to various cities. In Chicago, she served as the communications director for the Environmental Law and Policy Center and worked as the press secretary for U.S. Representative Lynn N. Rivers during her successful 2000 re-election campaign. Later, in Houston and Milwaukee, she continued her professional journey, including a stint as vice president at the Chicago office of FleishmanHillard, a public relations firm. However, after the birth of her daughters, Deb Andraca chose to be a stay-at-home mom, actively participating in her community by leading Girl Scouts troops and volunteering at her daughters' schools.

**Advocacy and Teaching:**
Moved by the tragedy of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Deb became involved with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense. She also pursued a teaching license from Alverno College and worked as a substitute teacher in the Whitefish Bay School District and Bruce-Guadalupe Community School.

**Political Career:**
In December 2019, Deb Andraca announced her candidacy for the Wisconsin State Assembly, challenging the 14-year incumbent Jim Ott. Her commitment to education, community, and advocacy resonated with voters, leading to her election in 2020. As a representative, she continues to champion the interests of her constituents in the diverse communities she serves.

Deb Andraca resides in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, with her husband, Marc Andraca, and their children, Mia and Andie.
