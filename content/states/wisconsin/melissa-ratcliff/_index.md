Melissa Amy Ratcliff (n√©e Larsen) is an American paralegal and Democratic politician hailing from Cottage Grove, Wisconsin. She currently serves as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 46th Assembly district since January 2023. Additionally, she holds a position on the Dane County Board of Supervisors.

Born in November 1976, Melissa grew up in Wausau, Wisconsin, and graduated from Wausau East High School in 1995. She furthered her education by obtaining a paralegal certification from Madison Area Technical College. For over two decades, she has worked as a paralegal at the Eisenberg Law Offices in Madison, Wisconsin.

In the Spring of 2018, Ratcliff secured her first public office when she was elected to the Cottage Grove village board. Later that same year, she was chosen to fill a vacant seat on the Dane County board after incumbent Danielle Williams resigned. Ratcliff's selection was ratified by a vote of the county board on September 6, 2018. She has since been re-elected to the Dane County Board and, following the Spring 2022 election, entered the race for the Democratic nomination in the 46th Assembly district, succeeding retiring incumbent Gary Hebl.

Melissa and her family reside in Cottage Grove, where her son attends Madison College, and her daughter is a freshman at Monona Grove High School.
