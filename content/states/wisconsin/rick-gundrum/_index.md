Rick McKay Gundrum is an American politician and businessman. A Republican, he represents the 58th district of the Wisconsin State Assembly.

Gundrum resides in Slinger, Wisconsin, and wears multiple hats. Not only is he a public servant, but he's also the owner of McKay Enterprisesâ€”an audio-visual company. His commitment to community service extends beyond politics; he has served on the Slinger Village Board and the Washington County Board of Supervisors, even chairing the latter.

In a special election held on January 15, 2018, Gundrum stepped into the shoes of the late Bob Gannon, who had been serving in the Wisconsin Assembly. As a staunch Republican, Gundrum continues to represent the citizens of the 58th Assembly District, which includes the City of West Bend, the Village of Jackson, and the Village of Slinger.
