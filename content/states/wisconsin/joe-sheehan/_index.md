Joe Sheehan is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the Wisconsin State Assembly. He represents the 26th Assembly District, having assumed office on January 6, 2025. His current term is set to conclude on January 4, 2027.

Joe Sheehan's journey into public service is deeply rooted in his background as an educator and community leader. Born in Michigan, he pursued his education at Michigan State University, earning dual bachelor's degrees in social science secondary education and psychology. His passion for education led him to the University of Houston, where he obtained a master's degree, and later to Marquette University, where he earned a Ph.D.

Sheehan's professional career began in education, where he worked as a teacher and assistant principal in Houston before moving to Wisconsin. In the Sheboygan Area School District, he served as an assistant principal, principal, and eventually as superintendent. His tenure as superintendent spanned 18 years, during which he focused on improving educational outcomes and fostering community engagement.

After retiring from his role in education, Sheehan transitioned to economic development, serving as the executive director of the Sheboygan County Economic Development Corporation. His leadership in this role further demonstrated his commitment to enhancing the quality of life for residents in his community.

In 2024, Sheehan announced his candidacy for the Wisconsin State Assembly. The redistricting of the 26th Assembly District presented an opportunity for him to bring his extensive experience in education and community development to the state legislature. His campaign emphasized the importance of equitable education, economic growth, and community well-being.

As a legislator, Joe Sheehan continues to advocate for policies that reflect his dedication to education, economic development, and the needs of his constituents. His diverse background and unwavering commitment to public service make him a respected figure in Wisconsin's political landscape.
