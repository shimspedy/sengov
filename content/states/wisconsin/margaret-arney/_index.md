Margaret Arney is a Democratic Party member serving in the Wisconsin State Assembly. She represents District 18 and assumed office on January 6, 2025. Her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Margaret Michele Arney, born Margaret Michele Tully on June 17, 1969, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has dedicated her career to public service, education, and community development. She graduated from Rufus King High School in 1987 and pursued higher education at Harvard University, earning a bachelor's degree in government studies in 1991. She furthered her academic journey at the University of Chicago, where she completed a master's degree in social service administration in 1994.

After her studies, Margaret began her professional career in Chicago, working with Chicago Commons until 2000. Upon returning to Milwaukee, she contributed to various nonprofit organizations, including the YWCA and the Milwaukee Art Museum, focusing on fundraising and market research. In 2010, she joined Cardinal Stritch University to lead their African American Leadership Program, a role she held for a decade. During this time, she also taught social work at Concordia University Wisconsin and served as a consultant for the African American Leadership Alliance of Milwaukee.

Margaret's political journey began with her first run for office in 2010, though she did not win. Undeterred, she remained active in civic affairs, co-founding the social justice group Tosa Together in 2016 and serving as president of the Wauwatosa Neighborhood Association Council. In 2022, she successfully ran for the Wauwatosa Common Council, becoming the first African American member of the council.

Her election to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 2024 marked a significant milestone in her career. As a legislator, Margaret continues to advocate for equity, inclusion, and community empowerment, drawing on her extensive experience in social service and community leadership. Her dedication to public service and her commitment to fostering positive change make her a respected figure in Wisconsin politics.
