Alex Robert Joers (born 1992) is an American communications professional and Democratic politician. He currently serves as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing Wisconsin's 79th Assembly district since January 2023. Prior to this role, Joers was a member of the Dane County Board of Supervisors.

Alex Joers was born in Madison, Wisconsin, and later moved to the neighboring city of Middleton during his childhood. He graduated from Middleton High School and earned his bachelor's degree in political science and public administration from the University of Wisconsinâ€“La Crosse in 2015. During high school, Joers was an active cross country athlete and also taught classes at the gym owned by his parents.

Since 2022, he has been employed as a program manager for AMPED Association Management, a company that provides management services to non-profits. Joers' clients include the Society for Research on Adolescence and the American Physical Therapy Association.

Joers' political journey began while he was in college, where he worked on campus get-out-the-vote projects. After college, he served as a legislative aide to state senator Jennifer Shilling and state representative Melissa Agard. He also worked in fundraising for the Wisconsin State Senate Democratic Committee and participated in state senator Julie Lassa's 2016 re-election campaign. Subsequently, he became a full-time legislative aide to state representative Dianne Hesselbein, eventually being promoted to Hesselbein's communications and policy aide in 2019.

In 2020, Joers ran for his first public office under the Run for Something campaign, which encourages young candidates to run for office. He was unopposed in his bid for the Dane County Board of Supervisors and was re-elected without opposition in 2022. Following Dianne Hesselbein's decision not to seek re-election in Wisconsin's 79th Assembly district, Joers announced his campaign for the open Assembly seat.

Inspired in part by the support from the Middleton community after the passing of his father, Joers continues to serve in the Wisconsin State Assembly, contributing to legislative efforts and representing his constituents.

Alex Joers resides in Madison, Wisconsin, with his spouse, Kathryn Sikora, and their child.
