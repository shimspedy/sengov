Alex Joers is a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 81st Assembly District. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end in January 2027.

Born on August 27, 1992, in Madison, Wisconsin, Alex grew up in Middleton, where he developed a strong connection to his community. He graduated from Middleton High School in 2011 and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in Political Science and Public Administration from the University of Wisconsinâ€“La Crosse in 2015. During his college years, Alex was actively involved in student government and Get Out the Vote initiatives, showcasing his early commitment to civic engagement.

Before his tenure in the State Assembly, Alex gained valuable experience working as a legislative aide to prominent Wisconsin lawmakers, including State Senator Jennifer Shilling and State Representative Melissa Agard. He also served as a communications and policy aide to State Representative Dianne Hesselbein, where he contributed to legislative efforts on issues such as gun safety, environmental protection, and student debt relief.

In 2020, Alex was elected to the Dane County Board of Supervisors, representing the 9th District. During his time on the board, he focused on land conservation, flood mitigation, public health, and affordable housing. His dedication to these issues earned him re-election in 2022.

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Alex has continued to advocate for policies that benefit his constituents and the broader community. He serves on several committees, including those focused on forestry, state parks, higher education, and tourism. His legislative priorities include expanding access to affordable childcare, reducing gun violence, and promoting a clean and sustainable environment for future generations.

Outside of his political career, Alex is a devoted family man. He married his college sweetheart, Katie, in 2018, and together they have two children. His background in small business, having worked at his family's gym in Middleton, has given him a unique perspective on the challenges faced by local entrepreneurs.

Alex Joers remains committed to serving the people of Wisconsin with integrity and a focus on creating a brighter future for all.
