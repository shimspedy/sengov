Eric Wimberger, born on April 2, 1979, hails from Green Bay, Wisconsin. He currently serves as a Republican politician in the Wisconsin Senate, representing the 30th Senate district since 2021. Prior to his political career, Eric wore a different hatâ€”as a United States Marine Corps officer in the Judge Advocate Division for four years.

His journey began with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from St. Cloud State University in Minnesota. After that, he earned his J.D. from Marquette University Law School in 2005. Notably, Eric spent time behind the wheel as a long-haul truck driver, covering over 120,000 miles for Schneider National.

Following his legal education, he donned the uniform and served in the Marine Corps, stationed both in Japan and Washington, D.C. His honorable discharge as a captain in 2010 marked the end of his military service. Back in the Green Bay area, Eric established his own law firm.

In the political arena, Eric made determined attempts at elected office. Although he narrowly missed victory in previous races, he persisted. When Senator Dave Hansen decided not to seek re-election in 2020, Eric seized the opportunity. The 30th Senate district witnessed a fierce battle, with significant outside spending. Ultimately, Eric Wimberger emerged as the victor, representing his constituents with dedication and resolve.

Beyond politics, Eric's entrepreneurial spirit shines. He operates a family-run candy store in Lakewood and maintains a legal practice in Green Bay. Born and raised in De Pere, Eric remains deeply connected to his community.
