Robert Wittke is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 63rd Assembly District. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end in January 2027.

Born on September 23, 1957, in Racine, Wisconsin, Wittke has deep roots in his community. He graduated from William Horlick High School in 1975 and earned a Bachelor of Arts in Accounting from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Eau Claire in 1980. Wittke's professional career spans over three decades in corporate taxation, working with prominent firms like Modine Manufacturing, Snap-on Incorporated, and Deloitte. Since 2012, he has been associated with CORPTAX, a tax software company, where he continues to contribute his expertise.

Wittke's journey into public service began with his election to the Racine Unified School District Board in 2016, where he represented the 9th District. His leadership skills were quickly recognized, and he served as the Board President from 2017 to 2019. During this time, he focused on improving the public education system and addressing the needs of one of Wisconsin's largest urban school districts.

In 2018, Wittke transitioned to state-level politics, successfully running for the Wisconsin State Assembly to represent the 62nd District. He served in this capacity until 2025, when redistricting led him to represent the 63rd District. Throughout his tenure, Wittke has been a strong advocate for education reform, economic development, and fiscal responsibility. His legislative efforts reflect his commitment to creating opportunities for small businesses, enhancing local employment, and ensuring a safe and effective education system.

Wittke resides in Wind Point, Wisconsin, with his wife, Alison. Together, they have four children. His dedication to his family and community continues to inspire his work in the Assembly, where he strives to make a positive impact on the lives of his constituents.
