Born on April 10, 1976, in Menomonie, Wisconsin, Clint Moses has deep roots in his community. He grew up on his family's farm in the town of Menomonie, where he still resides today. From an early age, he demonstrated a strong work ethic and a commitment to service, earning the rank of Eagle Scout during his time in the Boy Scouts. While in high school, he started a lawn care business to fund his college education.

Moses pursued higher education at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Stout, where he double-majored in human biology and psychology. He later earned his Doctor of Chiropractic degree from Northwestern College of Chiropractic. In 2003, he and his wife, Nora, opened Red Cedar Chiropractic, a practice that has served their community for over two decades.

In addition to his professional career, Moses has been actively involved in various community organizations. He has served as a board member and past president of the Community Foundation of Dunn County and has been a member of the Menomonie Rotary Club and the Menomonie Chamber of Commerce. His dedication to education and local governance was evident when he was elected to the Menomonie Area School Board in 2019.

Moses entered state politics in 2020, running for the Wisconsin State Assembly. His campaign focused on issues such as affordable healthcare, environmental preservation, and equitable funding for roads and schools. He won his seat and has since been a vocal advocate for his constituents. Throughout his tenure, Moses has served on several committees, including those focused on agriculture, health, and state affairs.

A devoted family man, Clint Moses lives with his wife and their four children in Menomonie. His life and career reflect a commitment to his community, a dedication to public service, and a passion for improving the lives of those he represents.
