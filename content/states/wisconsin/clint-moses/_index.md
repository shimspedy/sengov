Clint Moses was born and raised in Menomonie, Wisconsin. His childhood was filled with helping out on the family's small farm, playing sports, and participating in activities like Boy Scouts, where he earned the prestigious rank of Eagle Scout. Even at a young age, Clint displayed a strong work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit.

As a teenager, Clint started his own lawn care business, using the proceeds to fund his education. He attended Menomonie High School and later pursued a double major at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Stout, studying human biology and psychology. His commitment to education continued, and he went on to earn his doctorate in chiropractic from Northwestern College of Chiropractic.

In 2003, Clint and his wife, Nora, opened Red Cedar Chiropractic, where they have been serving their community ever since. As a chiropractor, small business owner, and farmer, Clint understands the importance of hard work, community engagement, and public service.

His journey into politics began when he was elected to the Menomonie Area School Board in April 2019. Clint's passion for affordable healthcare, environmental preservation, and equitable funding for roads and schools led him to run for the Wisconsin State Assembly. In the Republican primary, he emphasized these issues, along with his opposition to additional lockdowns or business restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Clint Moses won the primary and went on to secure victory in the general election, representing his district with dedication and a commitment to the well-being of his constituents. He and Nora reside on their family farm in the town of Menomonie, where they raise sheep and cattle.
