Patrick was born in Madison and raised up north in Marinette. He started working before he could drive, busing tables at a family restaurant for minimum wage. After graduating from high school, Patrick chose to make Stevens Point home when he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point (UWSP). Despite the busy schedule he kept while on campus, Patrick spent each of his summer, winter, and spring breaks back in Marinette working to pay for his education.

Following family tradition, he took a job at Silvan Industries, a carbon steel and industrial grade stainless steel pressure vessel fabricator. He worked overnight shifts chipping slag off of welds and cleaning tank interiors in the same factory his grandfather retired from. He gave back to his community by volunteering as a coach for the football team in nearby Crivitz. He also worked for Aacer Flooring, a hardwood flooring manufacturer, stacking lumber and prepping it for the kilns. Patrick even spent a summer working two jobs – groundskeeper and maintenance man for the School District of Marinette by day and package handler loading trucks for UPS by night.

Shortly after graduating from UW-Stevens Point with a bachelor’s degree in political science, Patrick met Hannah, his wife, whom he married in 2017. Hannah works as the Director of Advancement for Pacelli Catholic Schools in Stevens Point. They live in the Town of Hull together with their rescue dogs Reilly and Sage.

Patrick takes pride in his strength training and is a member of 212 Fitness where he can be seen frequently. He is an avid hunter, history buff, and big Wisconsin Badger football fan.

Work in the Senate

In 2016, the people of Central and Western Wisconsin elected Patrick to the Senate for the 24th District. He beat a long-time, well-funded incumbent Democrat to win back a seat that had not elected a Republican since 1968. Since then, he’s fought tirelessly in the Senate to further the values of his constituents. In his 2020 re-election campaign, up against a Democratic opponent with well over $1 million in funding, Patrick won again and increased his margin of victory to nearly 13%. Following this victory, in 2021, he was chosen by his colleagues to serve as Senate President Pro Tempore.

This past session, Patrick chaired the Senate Committee on Labor, Regulatory Reform, Veterans and Military Affairs. Prior to that, he chaired the Committee Health as well as the Committee on Workforce Development, Military Affairs, and Senior Issues. In his role as chair of these committees, he’s introduced and worked to pass dozens of bills to improve access to quality health care, strengthen our workforce, and support our veterans.

In 2022, Patrick was appointed to the Joint Finance Committee which is responsible for all state appropriations and expenditures, including the biennial budget. During his time on the committee, he helped craft a budget that cut taxes, while still making key investments.

Patrick knows that our communities are great places to live, work, and raise a family. That’s why he spends one day each month working “On the Job” with a variety of local employers. By doing this, he highlights the breadth and depth of jobs available in his Senate District and demonstrates the opportunities that are available locally. As a Senator, Patrick works hard to listen to all the people of his District—that’s why he’s held over 75 listening sessions since taking office.

Community Leader

Patrick is a member of the Stevens Point Elks Lodge 641 and Ignite Young Professionals, an affiliate network of the Portage County Business Council. He has held management and leadership roles on several national, state, and local political campaigns and is the former Chairman of the Republican Party of Portage County.

Business Advocate

Patrick has built a successful career in sales and understands the overwhelming demands on businesses of all sizes. He has seen the devastation that the Evers Administration’s overreach and government mandates have brought to businesses in his Senate District and across Wisconsin; no government should have the ability to designate one person’s work as essential and another’s as non-essential. As a sales professional, Patrick works closely with small business owners and is all too familiar with how complicated bureaucracy and regulation are hampering Wisconsin’s businesses.

A Vision for the Future

As a lifelong resident of this great state, Patrick loves Wisconsin and believes we have a bright future. Through his work in the Senate, he has shown that he can build consensus and bring people together to get things done for his constituents. He believes that everyone deserves an equal opportunity and is committed to ensuring that all Wisconsinites have the chance to pursue their own American Dream.
