Donna Mummau Rozar (n√©e Mummau) was born on February 9, 1950, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She later moved with her parents to Orange County, Virginia, where her father had purchased a farm. Growing up on that farm, she attended Orange County High School and graduated in 1968.

Donna's journey led her to a career in nursing. In 1971, she earned her nursing diploma from the Virginia Baptist Hospital School of Nursing in Lynchburg, Virginia. She then worked as an emergency room nurse at the University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville, where she also obtained her nurse practitioner certificate. Her nursing career took her to Norfolk General Hospital, where she served as a nurse practitioner for five years.

In 1981, Donna earned her bachelor's degree in nursing from the University of Tennessee. Alongside her professional pursuits, she and her husband, Dr. Ed Rozar, adopted children while living in various places like Dallas, Texas, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Morgantown, West Virginia. Eventually, they settled in Marshfield, Wisconsin, in 1988.

Tragically, Ed was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1989. As a cardiothoracic surgeon, he chose to retire from his practice to prevent accidental exposure to others. Donna and Ed courageously shared their story on national platforms, appearing on The TODAY Show and Good Morning America. After Ed's passing in 1993, Donna Rozar became a prominent national speaker on AIDS awareness.

In addition to her nursing background, Donna is a businesswoman and a Republican politician. She represents the 69th district of the Wisconsin State Assembly, which includes most of the city of Marshfield, along with rural areas in Clark County, Wood County, and Marathon County. Donna has also been a member of the Wood County Board of Supervisors since 2000.

Her commitment to public service and healthcare advocacy continues to shape her impactful journey.
