Born in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, Dave Maxey grew up in the state and graduated from Brookfield East High School in 1991. Following his graduation, he served in the United States Navy from 1991 to 1994, an experience that shaped his dedication to public service. After completing his military service, Maxey pursued higher education at Waukesha County Technical College, where he earned an associate degree in marketing in 2002.
