Ellen Schutt, born on October 16, 1995, is an American politician hailing from southern Wisconsin. A Republican, she currently serves as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 31st Assembly district. This district includes portions of Walworth and Rock Counties, and Schutt has held this position since January 2023.

Schutt's roots trace back to the town of Darien, Wisconsin, where she grew up on her family's farm. She attended Delavan Darien High School and later earned her bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. During her university years, she actively engaged in conservative politics on campus, re-founding the Madison chapter of Young Americans for Freedom and establishing a chapter of the Luce Society for conservative women. Her internship experiences included working with Wisconsin State Representative Amy Loudenbeck and Congressman Paul Ryan.

After completing her degree, Schutt worked as a legislative aide for Representative Loudenbeck and Representative Jesse James. Her political journey took a significant turn when, in December 2021, Amy Loudenbeck announced her candidacy for Secretary of State of Wisconsin, leaving her Assembly seat open. Schutt stepped up as a candidate for the Republican nomination in the 31st Assembly district. She secured victory in the primary and went on to defeat the Democratic candidate, Brienne Brown, in the general election.

Ellen Schutt's personal life includes her marriage to Eric Barbour, with whom she has one child. Barbour is also involved in politics, having worked for Representative Samantha Kerkman and managed state senator Van H. Wanggaard's re-election campaign.

Schutt's commitment to public service continues as she represents her constituents in the Wisconsin State Assembly, advocating for their interests and contributing to the legislative process.
