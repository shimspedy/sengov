Born on May 18, 1996, in Kaukauna, Wisconsin, Penterman grew up working on his familyâ€™s dairy farm, which instilled in him a strong work ethic and a deep connection to Wisconsin's agricultural roots. He pursued higher education at Ripon College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Politics and Government in 2018. During his time at Ripon, he founded the college's chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, showcasing his early commitment to conservative values and political engagement.

Penterman's career has been marked by a dedication to public service. He served in the United States Army from 2015 to 2019 as part of the Military Police Corps and continues to serve in the United States Army Reserve. His military background has shaped his leadership style and commitment to his constituents. Before his election to the Assembly, Penterman worked as a legislative assistant and clerk for the Wisconsin State Assembly, gaining valuable experience in the legislative process.

In 2021, Penterman entered the political arena when he ran for the 37th Assembly District seat, which had been vacated. He won a competitive Republican primary and subsequently secured victory in the special election. His tenure in the 37th District lasted until January 2025, after which he transitioned to representing the 38th District.

Throughout his legislative career, Penterman has been an advocate for issues such as veterans' affairs, education, and family values. He has served on several committees, including the Veterans and Military Affairs Committee, where he has been a vocal supporter of policies benefiting service members and their families. His dedication to his community and his ability to navigate complex legislative challenges have earned him respect among his peers and constituents alike.
