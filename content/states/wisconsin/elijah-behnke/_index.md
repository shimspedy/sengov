Elijah Behnke, born on February 15, 1983, is an American small business owner and a dedicated Republican politician. He currently serves as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 89th Assembly district since April 2021. However, following the 2024 redistricting, he has announced his intention to run for re-election in the newly redrawn 6th Assembly district.

Behnke's roots trace back to Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, where he spent his childhood working on his parents' nearby farm. After graduating from Oconto High School in 2001, he embarked on a journey to northeast Georgia to attend bible college. In 2006, he returned to Wisconsin and joined his mother's cleaning business. Not content with just that, he eventually founded his own cleaning business, Eschalon Cleaning LLC.

Beyond business endeavors, Behnke wears multiple hats. He manages a hobby farm and actively serves as a ministry leader in his church. His decision to enter politics was fueled by a desire to advocate for small business owners who faced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent safety measures.

In the 2021 Republican primary, Behnke secured endorsements from influential figures like State Senator Andr√© Jacque and Oconto County Sheriff Todd Skarban. His victory in the primary led to a successful campaign in the April special election, where he defeated Democrat Karl Jaeger.

However, it's worth noting that Behnke faced controversy when a recording emerged of him making unfounded claims about Democrat electoral fraud. Despite this, he remains a prominent figure in Wisconsin politics.

As we look ahead, Behnke's determination and commitment to his constituents continue to shape his political journey. Whether it's defending small businesses, championing religious freedom, or advocating for Wisconsin's agricultural community, Elijah Behnke remains a steadfast representative for everyday Wisconsinites.
