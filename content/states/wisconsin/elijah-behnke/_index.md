Elijah Behnke is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 6th Assembly District. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born on February 15, 1983, in Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, Elijah Behnke grew up on his family’s farm in the nearby area. His upbringing instilled in him a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for rural life. After graduating from Oconto High School in 2001, he pursued higher education at Toccoa Falls College, a Bible college in Georgia, where he earned an associate degree in 2005. Following his studies, Behnke returned to Wisconsin and began working in his mother’s cleaning business. A year later, he established his own company, Eschalon Cleaning LLC, showcasing his entrepreneurial spirit.

In addition to running his cleaning business, Behnke operates a hobby farm and serves as a ministry leader in his local church. His involvement in the community and his experiences as a small business owner motivated him to enter politics. He first gained political attention in December 2020, when he announced his candidacy for the Wisconsin State Assembly following the resignation of John Nygren. Behnke’s campaign focused on advocating for small business owners and addressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Behnke’s political career began in May 2021 when he won a special election to represent the 89th Assembly District. After the 2024 redistricting, he transitioned to representing the 6th Assembly District. Throughout his tenure, Behnke has been an active participant in legislative matters, serving on various committees and championing issues important to his constituents.

Elijah Behnke’s journey from a farm in Oconto County to the Wisconsin State Assembly reflects his dedication to public service and his commitment to the values of his community. His story is one of perseverance, leadership, and a desire to make a positive impact on the lives of those he represents.
