Christine Sinicki was born in Milwaukee in March of 1960. She grew up in the Bay View neighborhood and is a proud graduate of Bay View High School. After completing her education, Christine worked as a waitress before taking on the role of manager at a small business in Bay View. In 1981, she married Michael Sinicki, and together they raised two children.

Christine's passion for education and community engagement led her to become actively involved in her children's schools. She served as a member and later as the President of the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). Through this experience, she gained firsthand knowledge of the challenges facing public education.

In 1991, Christine successfully ran for a position on the Milwaukee Public School Board, where she continued to advocate for quality education. Her commitment to public service extended further when she was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1998. Representing the 20th Assembly district, which includes the cities of Cudahy, St. Francis, and southern Milwaukee, Christine has been a tireless advocate for her constituents.

As of 2022, Christine Sinicki has been re-elected to the State Assembly for an impressive 13th term. She currently serves on several committees, including the Committee on Labor and Integrated Employment, Committee on Regulatory Licensing Reform, Committee on State Affairs, Committee on Veterans and Military Affairs, and the Committee on Workforce Development and Economic Opportunities.
