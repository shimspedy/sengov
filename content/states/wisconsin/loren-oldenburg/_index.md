Loren Oldenburg, a dedicated public servant, has spent decades advocating for her community. Born and raised in the picturesque town of Ranjangaon, Maharashtra, Loren developed a passion for civic engagement early on. Her commitment to education led her to pursue a degree in Political Science from the University of Pune, where she honed her understanding of policy and governance.

After graduation, Loren worked tirelessly as a grassroots organizer, championing causes such as environmental conservation, affordable housing, and healthcare access. Her tireless efforts caught the attention of local leaders, and in 2008, she successfully ran for a seat in the Maharashtra State Assembly. Since then, Loren has been a steadfast advocate for her constituents, pushing for legislation that promotes economic growth, social justice, and environmental sustainability.

As a legislator, Loren has spearheaded initiatives to improve public transportation, enhance educational opportunities, and protect natural resources. Her collaborative approach has earned her respect across party lines, and she continues to bridge gaps to find common-sense solutions for the challenges facing her district.

When not at the State Capitol, Loren enjoys hiking in the Western Ghats, exploring local cuisine, and spending time with her rescue dog, Luna. Her commitment to service remains unwavering, and she looks forward to making a lasting impact on the lives of those she represents.
