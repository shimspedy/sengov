Sequanna Taylor is a member of the Democratic Party, serving in the Wisconsin State Assembly. She represents the 11th Assembly District, having assumed office on January 6, 2025. Her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sequanna Taylor has dedicated her life to education, community service, and advocacy. She grew up in the Amani neighborhood on Milwaukee's northwest side and was the first in her family to graduate from both high school and college. Her educational journey was marked by perseverance, as she attended college at night while working and raising her children. She earned an associate's degree from Concordia University Wisconsin and later a bachelor's degree from Cardinal Stritch University.

Taylor's professional career began in Milwaukee Public Schools, where she worked for 15 years as a coordinator for parents of special needs students. Her commitment to education extended beyond her professional role, as she became actively involved in the Milwaukee Teachers' Education Association and eventually served on the board of directors for the National Education Association.

Her political career took off in 2016 when she was elected to the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors, representing the 2nd District. She has been re-elected multiple times and currently represents the 5th District on the County Board. In addition to her role on the County Board, Taylor served a four-year term on the Milwaukee Public Schools Board of Education, further solidifying her commitment to improving educational opportunities for her community.

In 2024, Taylor announced her candidacy for the Wisconsin State Assembly's 11th District after the incumbent, Dora Drake, decided to run for the Wisconsin Senate. Taylor won the Democratic primary with an overwhelming majority and faced no opposition in the general election. Her victory marked a new chapter in her career, allowing her to bring her passion for education, community engagement, and social justice to the state level.

Beyond her professional and political achievements, Sequanna Taylor is a devoted mother and community leader. She has been actively involved in various organizations, including Open Arms Inc. and Taylor Legacies, which focus on community development and support. Her dedication to her constituents and her unwavering commitment to making a positive impact have made her a respected figure in Wisconsin politics.
