Born in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, in 1970, Duke Tucker grew up in the farming community of Trade Lake in Burnett County. After graduating from Grantsburg High School, he enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he served as a combat communications specialist during the Gulf War.

He won the Republican primary with nearly 50% of the vote and went on to secure a decisive victory in the general election, earning nearly 67% of the vote.

As a legislator, Tucker has focused on issues such as public safety, fiscal responsibility, and protecting individual freedoms. He is a staunch advocate for the Second Amendment and has worked to ensure secure and fair elections. Tucker is also committed to supporting education and workforce development, emphasizing the importance of preparing students for self-sufficiency and success in the trades.
