Warren Petryk was born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin in 1955 as the younger of two sons of Joseph and Florence Petryk. He grew up in the Dunn County Village of Boyceville, where he was very active in school as a musician, athlete, organizer, and student government leader. Warren graduated in 1973 as valedictorian and attended UW-Stout for two years before transferring to UW-Eau Claire, where he graduated with highest honors, earning his B.A. in philosophy in 1978.

In 1972, Warren and several classmates started a band called “The Memories,” which has been entertaining people for over 50 years. While the band initially kept him on the road full-time across America for over 25 years, it is now part-time, performing at outdoor festivals, fairs, concerts, and private functions each year. Warren also lends his voice to church services and special events.

In 1996, Warren became the Community Relations and Telethon Coordinator for United Cerebral Palsy of West Central Wisconsin. His commitment to public service led him to run for State Representative in the 93rd Assembly District. He won a three-way primary election, the general election, and even a recount. Warren was sworn into office on January 3rd, 2011.

Currently, Representative Petryk serves as the Chair of the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development and Economic Opportunities. He is also a member of several other committees, including Energy and Utilities, Labor and Integrated Employment, Insurance, and Veterans and Military Affairs. Additionally, he contributes to the Governor's Council on Workforce Investment.

Beyond politics, Warren has been deeply involved in the Chippewa Valley Community for decades. He has been a speaker, singer, organizer, and emcee for countless events in both the public and private sectors. He remains an active member of various chambers of commerce and sportsmen's clubs. His dedication to public service has earned him awards, including Wisconsin VFW 2013 Legislator of the Year and Wisconsin AmVets 2014 Veterans Advocate of the Year.

Warren enjoys spending time with loved ones and friends. When he's not working, you'll find him appreciating great music, reading, writing, fishing, gardening, and hunting for wild turkeys. As a former Eagle Scout, he continues to contribute to the Boy Scouts of America's Chippewa Valley Council.

Representative Petryk approaches his role with humility, casting votes that encourage fiscal prudence through lower spending, debt reduction, and employment growth. He is honored to represent the residents of the 93rd Assembly District and pays close attention to all viewpoints on the challenges facing our state.
