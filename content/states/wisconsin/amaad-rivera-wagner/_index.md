Amaad Rivera-Wagner is a Democratic Party member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing District 90. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Amaad Rivera-Wagner has a rich history of public service and community involvement. Before his election to the Wisconsin State Assembly, he served as the Chief of Staff to Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich. In this role, he led significant policy and communication efforts, including managing federally funded projects and coordinating advisory councils for various communities, such as the Hmong, Latino, and LGBTQ+ groups. His leadership extended to managing the $5 million JBS project, which aims to develop a new neighborhood featuring a destination park, urban farm, and equitable housing.

Raised by a teenage single mother who faced homelessness, Rivera-Wagner's early life experiences shaped his commitment to social justice and community advocacy. His journey into politics began when he helped his mother form a union to address unfair wages, a fight they ultimately won. This victory ignited his passion for public service, leading him to take on roles at every level of government. He has worked as a housing policy director in state government and as a policy advisor to U.S. Senator Ed Markey.

In addition to his political career, Rivera-Wagner has been deeply involved in nonprofit and community initiatives. He co-chaired the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force for the Green Bay Chamber and was the founding co-chair of the Advocacy Council for the United Way of Brown County. His efforts in these roles have led to groundbreaking projects, such as creating a mobile resource center for Brown County and launching initiatives to expand childcare options and homeownership opportunities in Green Bay.

Amaad Rivera-Wagner resides in the Astor Park neighborhood of Green Bay with his husband, William, and their two dogs, Appa and Lambeau. His life and career reflect a steadfast dedication to uplifting marginalized communities and fostering equitable opportunities for all.
