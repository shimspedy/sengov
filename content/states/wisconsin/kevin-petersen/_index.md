Kevin David Petersen, born on December 14, 1964, hails from Waupaca, Wisconsin. He's a dedicated Republican politician and a co-owner of a family-run electronics corporation. Kevin's commitment to public service led him to the U.S. Navy, where he served in submarine duty from 1983 to 1994, including during the Persian Gulf War. After leaving active duty, he continued his service as a member of the U.S. Navy Reserve until 2008.

Education-wise, Kevin earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of New Mexico in 1989. His passion for community involvement led him to serve as a Town of Dayton supervisor from 2001 to 2007. In 2006, he emerged victorious in a three-way primary, securing the Republican nomination for the Wisconsin State Assembly in the 40th district. In the subsequent general election, he narrowly defeated Democrat Dan Naylor.

Kevin Petersen has been representing portions of Waupaca and Waushara counties in the Wisconsin State Assembly since 2007. Currently in his eighth term, he also holds the position of Assistant Majority Leader since 2021. His dedication to public service and his background in both business and military service continue to shape his contributions to the state.
