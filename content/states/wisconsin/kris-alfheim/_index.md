Kristin Alfheim is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the Wisconsin State Senate, representing District 18. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 3, 2029.

Born in Wausau, Wisconsin, Kristin Alfheim grew up on her family's beef farm in Marathon County. She graduated from D.C. Everest Senior High School in Schofield, Wisconsin, in 1989. Her early career began humbly, working at McDonald's, before she transitioned into the financial services industry in 1999. Over the years, she established herself as a successful businesswoman, owning her own small business as a retirement planner. Her dedication extended beyond her professional life, as she actively engaged in volunteer government advocacy for organizations like the Alzheimer's Association and the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors.

Alfheim's political journey began in 2021 when she was elected to the Appleton Common Council, representing the 11th District. Her tenure on the council earned her a reputation as a thoughtful and balanced leader, often referred to as "the moderator" due to her pivotal role as a swing vote. She was re-elected in 2023 but chose not to seek re-election in 2025, focusing instead on her aspirations for the Wisconsin State Senate.

In 2024, following redistricting that shifted Appleton into the 18th Senate District, Alfheim ran for the open seat. She faced no opposition in the Democratic primary and went on to defeat Republican candidate Anthony Phillips in the general election, securing 53% of the vote. Her victory marked a significant milestone in her political career, as she became a prominent voice for her constituents in the Wisconsin State Senate.

Throughout her career, Kristin Alfheim has been a staunch advocate for issues such as healthcare accessibility, public education funding, and women's rights. Her commitment to these causes reflects her dedication to improving the lives of Wisconsinites. Beyond her professional and political endeavors, Alfheim is a proud mother and a resident of Appleton, Wisconsin, where she continues to contribute to her community with passion and determination.
