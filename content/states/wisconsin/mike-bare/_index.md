Michael Andrew "Mike" Bare (born March 1983) is an American policy analyst and Democratic politician hailing from Verona, Wisconsin. He wears multiple hats, and here's a glimpse into his journey:

**Education:**
- Born and raised in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, Mike graduated from Manitowoc's Lincoln High School in 2001.
- He then spread his wings and flew to Washington, D.C., where he attended American University.
- In 2006, he earned his bachelor's degree, and in 2010, he proudly added a master's degree to his academic achievements.

**Political Career:**
- Mike's political journey began during his undergraduate years. As a student, he worked as a field organizer on John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign.
- After the election, he joined forces with United States Senator Russ Feingold, serving as a legislative clerk and later as research director during Feingold's re-election campaign.
- In 2013, Mike was appointed to the Verona city council, filling a vacancy. Although he wasn't elected to a full term in 2014, this experience fueled his passion for public service.
- He co-founded the Wisconsin chapter of the New Leaders Council, dedicated to recruiting and training young progressive leaders.
- In 2020, Mike was elected to the Dane County board of supervisors, running unopposed in an open seat. He secured re-election without opposition in 2022.
- Just after the Spring 2022 election, incumbent State Representative Sondy Pope announced her retirement after an impressive 20-year tenure in the Assembly.
- And that's when Mike stepped onto a bigger stage: He became a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 80th Assembly district since January 2023.

**Beyond Politics:**
- Mike's commitment extends beyond the political arena. Before joining the State Assembly, he advocated for Wisconsin's low-income population at the Community Advocates Public Policy Institute[^3^][3].
- Oh, and did I mention that he's also a co-owner of the Olbrich biergarten? Yes, he played a pivotal role in bringing a German-style beer garden to Madison's Olbrich Park in 2016.
