David B. Armstrong, born on October 3, 1961, is an American politician and local administrator. Representing the 75th district of the Wisconsin State Assembly, he is a Republican. This district encompasses Barron County, the southern half of Washburn County, and several neighboring towns in Polk, St. Croix, and Dunn counties in northwestern Wisconsin. Armstrong was elected to this position in November 2020.

Before entering politics, Armstrong had a background in the substance abuse testing industry. He held positions as a vice president at Healthcomp Evaluation Services Corporation and ClinNet Solutions (which was later acquired by ADP). Additionally, he founded two health-related companies earlier in his career, both of which were also acquired.

Armstrong's civic involvement extends beyond the State Assembly. He served on the Rice Lake City Council from 2009 to 2013 and was a board member of the Rice Lake Cable Commission until 2020. Furthermore, he has been the executive director of the Barron County Economic Development Corporation since 2012. Armstrong also sits on the Rice Lake Utilities Commission.

During his political journey, Armstrong faced controversy when his Twitter feed revealed posts related to the QAnon conspiracy theory. While he did not disavow the conspiracy, he clarified that he found its core claims "interesting" but not necessarily credible. His feed also contained years of controversial content, including racism, misogyny, religious bigotry, and conspiracy theories.

Despite these challenges, David B. Armstrong continues to represent his constituents in the Wisconsin State Assembly, committed to making their voices heard in Madison.
