Jon Plumer, born on March 1, 1955, hails from Sterling, Illinois. He is a graduate of West High School (Class of 1973). For three decades, Jon worked as a route salesman for Kraft Foods, serving the greater Madison area. After retiring, he and his wife embarked on a new venture: opening and operating martial arts schools across the state, with three locations.

Jon's community involvement runs deep. Before his election to the Assembly, he actively contributed to the community in various capacities. Notably, he served as the president of both the Lodi and Lake Wisconsin Chamber of Commerce. Additionally, Jon co-founded the annual Lodi Pride free Thanksgiving dinnerâ€”a heartwarming tradition.

In the 2023-2025 legislative session, Jon Plumer was appointed Assistant Majority Leader. He currently serves on several committees, including the Committee on Assembly Organization, Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse Prevention, Committee on Rules, Committee on Tourism, and Committee on Transportation. He's also part of the Joint Committee on Legislative Organization and the Speaker's Task Force on Human Trafficking.

Jon and his wife, Chris, have been happily married for 45 years. Together, they have four grown daughters and nine cherished grandchildren.
