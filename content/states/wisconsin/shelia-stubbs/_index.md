Shelia Stubbs is a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 78th District. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end in January 2027.

Born on February 22, 1971, in Camden, Arkansas, Shelia Stubbs moved to Beloit, Wisconsin, at a young age. She graduated from Beloit Memorial High School and pursued higher education at Tougaloo College, earning a degree in political science. She furthered her studies with a degree in criminal justice administration from Mount Senario College and a master's degree in management from Cardinal Stritch University.

Shelia Stubbs has a long history of public service and community involvement. Before her tenure in the Wisconsin State Assembly, she served for 16 years on the Dane County Board of Supervisors, where she was the first African American woman to chair a standing committee and hold the position of vice chair. Her work on the board included initiatives to address racial disparities, improve public safety, and enhance community engagement.

In the Wisconsin State Assembly, Stubbs has been a vocal advocate for criminal justice reform, environmental protection, and social equity. She has co-authored bipartisan legislation to combat human trafficking and expand the use of Silver Alerts to protect vulnerable populations. Her leadership extends beyond legislation, as she has been actively involved in organizations such as the NAACP and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.

Shelia Stubbs is also a dedicated family woman. She and her husband, Bishop Dr. Godfrey Stubbs, have a daughter named Aquila. Her commitment to her community and her constituents continues to drive her work in the Wisconsin State Assembly, where she strives to create a more inclusive and equitable society.
