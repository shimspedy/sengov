Renuka Mayadev was born in Columbus, Ohio, in 1974. She pursued her undergraduate studies at Northwestern University, majoring in economics, and later earned her law degree from Georgetown University Law Center. Her early career was marked by her role as a policy advisor to Ohio Governor Ted Strickland, where she focused on juvenile justice, public safety, and workers' compensation.

In 2021, Mayadev joined the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association Board of Directors, reflecting her commitment to advocating for children and families. Her dedication to public service and policy reform led her to run for the Wisconsin State Assembly in 2024. Following redistricting, she contested the open seat in District 77 and secured the Democratic nomination with endorsements from prominent figures like former Governor Jim Doyle and State Senator Kelda Roys. She won the primary election with 48% of the vote and, with no Republican challenger, was elected unopposed in the general election.

Renuka Mayadev resides in Madison, Wisconsin, with her husband, Daniel Tokaji, who is the Dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School, and their two children. In addition to her legislative duties, she serves as a program advisor for maternal and child health at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Her career reflects a lifelong dedication to improving the lives of children and families, as well as a steadfast commitment to democratic values and public service.
