Jodi Habush Sinykin is a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Senate, representing District 8. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 3, 2029.

Jodi Habush Sinykin has dedicated her career to public service, environmental advocacy, and community engagement. Born and raised in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, she graduated from Nicolet High School in Glendale before pursuing higher education at the University of Michigan, where she earned her bachelor's degree with honors. She later attended Harvard Law School, obtaining her Juris Doctor in 1992.

After completing her education, Jodi began her professional journey as a judicial clerk in the federal district court system. She then transitioned to private legal practice, eventually becoming a partner at the Wisconsin-based law firm Habush Habush & Rottier. In 1995, she and her husband, Dan Sinykin, purchased a textile manufacturing business, Monterey Mills, which they have successfully operated in Wisconsin for decades.

Jodi's passion for environmental conservation led her to join Midwest Environmental Advocates in 2003, where she became a policy expert on freshwater stewardship and wildlife conservation. She played a pivotal role in the negotiation and ratification of the Great Lakes Compact, a historic agreement aimed at protecting the Great Lakes' water resources. Her advocacy extended to addressing issues such as groundwater management, pollution control, and wildlife protection.

In addition to her environmental work, Jodi has been actively involved in legislative efforts to improve community welfare. She worked on bipartisan initiatives to address inhumane practices in puppy mills, resulting in the passage of significant legislation to regulate these facilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, her family's business pivoted to produce essential protective equipment for first responders and healthcare workers across Wisconsin.

Jodi's decision to run for public office was driven by her commitment to serving her community and addressing critical issues facing Wisconsin. Her election to the Wisconsin State Senate marked the beginning of her tenure as a dedicated advocate for her constituents in District 8. Throughout her career, Jodi has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to protecting natural resources, supporting small businesses, and fostering bipartisan collaboration to create meaningful change.
