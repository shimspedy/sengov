Robin Vos is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing District 33. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Robin Vos has been a prominent figure in Wisconsin politics for many years. Born and raised in Burlington, Wisconsin, he has deep roots in Racine County, where his family has lived for generations. He graduated from Burlington High School in 1986 and later earned a bachelor's degree in Political Science and Public Relations from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Whitewater in 1991. During his college years, he developed a passion for public service and was appointed by Governor Tommy Thompson as the student representative on the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents.

Before his tenure in the State Assembly, Vos served on the Racine County Board for a decade, where he played a key role in shaping the county budget as the chair of the Finance Committee. His leadership in local government laid the foundation for his career in state politics.

In addition to his political career, Vos is a successful businessman. He owns and operates several businesses in southeastern Wisconsin, including rental properties, a car wash, and a popcorn company. His entrepreneurial spirit and focus on customer service have been integral to his success in both business and public service.

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Vos has been a vocal advocate for conservative policies. He has campaigned on issues such as lowering taxes, reducing government mandates, and promoting economic development. Over the years, he has played a significant role in shaping legislation, including efforts to limit public-sector union activity and reduce the authority of state executive officials.

Vos's leadership extends beyond his role as a legislator. He has served as the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly since 2013, making him the longest-serving Speaker in the state's history. In this capacity, he has been instrumental in maintaining Republican control of the Assembly and advancing the party's legislative agenda.

Throughout his career, Robin Vos has been a dedicated public servant, committed to representing the interests of his constituents and working towards a more efficient and effective government. His contributions to Wisconsin politics and his community have made him a respected figure in the state.
