Robin Joseph Vos (born July 5, 1968) is an American businessman and Republican politician. He has been serving as the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly since 2013. Vos has been a member of the Assembly since 2005, representing most of the southern half of Racine County.

Early Life and Education:
- Born in 1968 in Burlington, Wisconsin, Vos attended Burlington High School, graduating in 1986.
- He then pursued his studies at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Whitewater, majoring in political science and public relations.
- Fun fact: While at Whitewater, he roomed with Reince Priebus, who later became chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and White House chief of staff.

Political Career Highlights:
- Vos gained prominence for his role in advancing legislation to weaken bargaining rights and labor unions in Wisconsin during Scott Walker's governorship. This effort culminated in the 2012 Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election.
- Since 2013, he has held the position of Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, maintaining Republican control of the chamber through heavily gerrymandered maps.
- During Governor Tony Evers's tenure (a Democrat), Vos actively sought to limit the governor's powers.
- Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Vos opposed measures such as mask mandates and vaccine requirements by private businesses.
- In response to claims of election fraud after Joe Biden's 2020 victory, Vos allocated taxpayer funds for an investigation led by Michael Gableman. Gableman's report, released in March 2022, contained false claims and conspiracy theories.
- Vos eventually fired Gableman in August 2022, after Gableman endorsed Vos's primary challenger.

Robin Vos continues to play a significant role in Wisconsin politics, navigating complex issues and shaping legislative outcomes.
