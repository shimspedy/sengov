Romaine Robert Quinn, born on July 30, 1990, hails from Rice Lake, Wisconsin. He attended St. Joseph Catholic School in Rice Lake and graduated from Rice Lake High School. During his senior year of high school, Quinn made an impressive move: he ran for and was elected to the Rice Lake City Council. Notably, he assumed the role of Mayor of Rice Lake at the tender age of 19.

Quinn's educational journey took him to the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, where he earned a bachelor's degree in Political Science with an emphasis on Public Leadership. But that's not allâ€”he also spent time at the University of Wisconsin-Barron County and the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.

A former Coca-Cola salesman, Romaine Quinn is now a full-time legislator. Since January 2023, he has been representing the 25th Senate district in the Wisconsin State Senate. Quinn resides in Cameron with his wife, Racquel, and their two sons, and they look forward to raising their growing family right here in the heart of the 25th Senate Seat.
