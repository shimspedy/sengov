Amy Binsfeld was born and raised in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. Her roots run deep in the community, and she learned the value of hard work from watching her great-grandparents, grandparents, and parents pour their time and energy into the family business. As a young girl, she worked at Bill's Piggly Wiggly during her school years and later joined her family's business, Bitter Neumann Appliance Furniture Mattress, where she focused on the Furniture Department.

In 1995, Amy graduated from Manitowoc Lutheran High School. Her interest in politics grew over the years, and she even shared her vision with Representative Kestell during a visit to Madison, telling him that someday she would be in his office representing their community. With the support of her husband and family, she returned to school and earned her paralegal degree in 2012, graduating with Presidential Honors and as a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society.

Amy is a devoted Christian, a hard worker, and a parent. She believes in bringing God, family, and the United States Constitution back into our homes and schools. Her priorities include building on strong family values, encouraging Christian principles, supporting school choice for youth education, and ensuring that individuals can make their own healthcare decisions.

As a full-time legislator, Amy Binsfeld is committed to being a voice for the people of the 27th District. She understands that sometimes it feels like no one is listening, but she wants everyone to know that she will listen and take their thoughts to Madison, advocating for their needs and concerns.
