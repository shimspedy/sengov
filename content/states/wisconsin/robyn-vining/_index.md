Wisconsin State Representative Robyn Vining represents the 14th Assembly District, which includes the people of Wauwatosa and West Allis. She resides in Wauwatosa with her husband (a professor), where they've lovingly raised two children. Their home is enlivened by a wild and bonkers boxer puppy who enthusiastically joins every Zoom call—because even politicians need a furry co-worker!

Rep. Vining wears multiple hats: she's not only a dedicated public servant but also a local small business owner. About fifteen years ago, she founded her own photography business. In Madison, you'll find her passionately working on legislation to improve the health and lives of children and families. Her focus areas include infant and maternal health, combating violent crimes against women and children, supporting the small business community, promoting accessibility, and advocating for good government.

The district kids affectionately refer to her as "Rep. Robyn." She takes her oath seriously, ensuring that every Wisconsin child has the constitutional right to an adequately funded and world-class public education. You might recognize her Mental Healthcare is Healthcare legislation, which gained national attention on PBS NewsHour. Locally, her Save Our Schools bill has been celebrated.

Here's a glimpse of Rep. Vining's committee and other work:
- Chair of The Milwaukee Delegation
- Ranking Member of The Assembly Committee on Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Prevention
- Ranking Member of The Assembly Committee on Family Law
- Member of The Assembly Committee on Health, Aging, and Long-Term Care
- Member of The Assembly Committee on Children and Families
- Member of The Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economy, and Small Business Development
- Vice-Chair of The Speaker’s Task Force on Childhood Health
- Participant in the 2022 State-Tribal Relations Study Committee
- Member of the 2019-2020 Speaker’s Task Force on Adoption
- Serves on the State Fair Board during the 2021-2022 legislative session

Rep. Robyn Vining's commitment to her constituents and her tireless advocacy make her a force to be reckoned with in Wisconsin politics.
