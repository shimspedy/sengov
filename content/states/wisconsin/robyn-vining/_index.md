Robyn Vining is a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 13th Assembly District. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end in January 2027.

Born on November 11, 1976, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, Robyn Vining has had a diverse and impactful career. She grew up in various locations, attending school in Austin, Texas, and later graduating from James Madison High School in Vienna, Virginia, in 1996. She pursued higher education at James Madison University, earning bachelor's degrees in Psychology and Studio Art. She furthered her studies by obtaining a master's degree in Theology and Culture from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in 2002.

Before entering politics, Vining worked as a pastor and later established herself as a small business owner and photographer in the Milwaukee area. Her passion for social justice led her to co-found several nonprofit organizations, including Exploit No More, which focuses on ending child sex trafficking, as well as Help Portrait Milwaukee and The Milwaukee Portrait Project. Her dedication to community service earned her the title of Wisconsin Mother of the Year in 2017, awarded by American Mothers.

Vining's political journey began in 2018 when she ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly's 14th District. Her campaign was marked by a close and dramatic election, where she ultimately secured victory by a narrow margin. She served the 14th District until 2025, when she transitioned to representing the 13th District. Throughout her tenure, Vining has been a vocal advocate for issues such as public education, healthcare access, and social equity. Her legislative efforts reflect her commitment to creating a more inclusive and supportive community for all Wisconsinites.

Robyn Vining resides in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, with her husband, Jim Vining, and their two children. Her life and career exemplify a dedication to service, both in her local community and in the broader political landscape.
