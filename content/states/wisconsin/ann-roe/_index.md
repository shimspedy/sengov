Ann Roe is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the Wisconsin State Assembly. She represents the 44th Assembly District and assumed office on January 6, 2025. Her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Ann Roe was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in the Chicago area. She graduated from Evanston Township High School in 1984 and went on to earn her bachelor's degree in English and classical languages from Lawrence University in 1988. Later, she pursued her MBA with a focus on finance and marketing at Northeastern University, graduating in 1994. After completing her education, she moved to Janesville, Wisconsin, where she has been deeply involved in the community ever since.

Ann's professional career has been diverse and impactful. She has worked as a lecturer at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Whitewater's College of Business and Economics and as a planning consultant for the School District of Janesville. Since 2009, she has been a small business owner, running Custom College Solutions LLC, a company dedicated to helping students navigate their educational and career paths. Her work has supported students from middle school through graduate school, providing guidance on high school, college, apprenticeships, and job opportunities.

Beyond her professional endeavors, Ann has been an active member of her community. She has served on several nonprofit boards, including the Janesville Woman's Club and Downtown Janesville Inc., and has held leadership roles such as president of the Beloit Janesville Symphony Orchestra. Her commitment to community service is evident in her involvement with various organizations aimed at improving the lives of her fellow residents.

Ann's political journey began with her candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2022, where she ran in Wisconsin's 1st congressional district. Although she did not win, her campaign brought her closer to the issues and concerns of her constituents. In 2024, she announced her candidacy for the Wisconsin State Assembly's 44th District after the incumbent, Sue Conley, decided not to seek re-election. Ann secured Conley's endorsement and went on to win the election, marking the beginning of her tenure in the State Assembly.

As a legislator, Ann Roe is committed to addressing the needs of her district and advocating for policies that promote education, economic development, and community well-being. Her background as an educator, business owner, and community leader provides her with a unique perspective and a strong foundation for her work in public service.
