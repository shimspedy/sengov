Tom Michalski, an American information technology professional and Republican politician, hails from Waukesha County, Wisconsin. Born and raised in Greenfield, Wisconsin, he graduated from Greenfield High School in 1969. After serving in the U.S. Air Force from 1970 to 1976, Michalski earned his bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Milwaukee in 1976.

His career path led him to provide information technology services to Marquette University in Milwaukee, where he worked for an impressive 30 years. In addition to his professional endeavors, Michalski has been an active member of his community. He joined the volunteer fire department in Elm Grove, Wisconsin, in the late 1990s and has continued to serve there. He was elected to the board of trustees of Elm Grove in 2011 and has been a dedicated member of the Waukesha County board of supervisors since 2016, winning re-election in 2018, 2020, and 2022.

In 2021, when incumbent Wisconsin State Assembly member Sara Rodriguez announced her decision to run for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin, Michalski seized the opportunity and declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 13th Assembly district. He narrowly won the primary and went on to secure victory in the November general election, representing Wisconsin's 13th Assembly district since January 2023.

With over 17 years of combined county and village experience, Michalski brings both knowledge and life experience to his role, aiming to enhance the quality of life for residents in his district. He currently resides in Elm Grove, Wisconsin, with his spouse, Jennifer Morris, and their two children.
