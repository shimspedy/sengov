Vinnie Miresse is a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 71st Assembly District. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born on November 26, 1977, in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, Vinnie Miresse has built a career that reflects his commitment to sustainable living and community development. He graduated from Goodrich High School in 1996 and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in social sciences from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Stevens Point in 2001. His early career included roles at the Central Wisconsin Environmental Station, where he worked as a site manager and environmental educator. Miresse also pursued his passion for music, performing and teaching during his time in Boise, Idaho.

In 2008, during the Great Recession, Miresse returned to Stevens Point, Wisconsin, where he worked for Central Waters Brewing Company and Northwind Renewable Energy. In 2011, he founded Wholistic Home Solutions LLC, a residential remodeling business focused on sustainable and energy-efficient designs. This venture became his primary occupation and a testament to his dedication to environmental stewardship.

Miresse's political journey began in 2017 when he was appointed to the Portage County Board of Supervisors. He was subsequently elected to full terms in 2018, 2020, and 2022, often running unopposed. His tenure on the board was marked by his efforts to balance ecological concerns with economic development. In 2024, he announced his candidacy for the Wisconsin State Assembly and won the general election, succeeding Katrina Shankland.

As a state legislator, Miresse focuses on issues such as education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. He advocates for investments in public schools, technical colleges, and universities, as well as partnerships between local businesses and childcare providers. He is also a strong proponent of Medicaid expansion and reproductive health freedoms. His legislative priorities reflect his belief in creating a Wisconsin economy that works for everyday people while addressing the challenges of climate change.

Miresse resides in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, with his wife, Gina Victoria Sinisi, and their two children. His life and career are deeply rooted in his community, and he continues to work toward a future that balances ecological responsibility with economic opportunity.
