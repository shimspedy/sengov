Julian Bradley is an American businessman and Republican politician hailing from Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Born on February 11, 1981, in Baltimore, Maryland, he later moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin, at the age of 11. Bradley's journey has been as diverse as it is fascinating.

- **Early Life and Career:**
  Julian Bradley's interest in politics sparked at an early age. After graduating from La Crosse Central High School in 1999, he faced financial challenges but found an unexpected path—professional wrestling. Under the pseudonym Kris Krude, he made his wrestling debut in 1999. However, his passion for education led him back to Wisconsin, where he completed his bachelor's degree in political science and economics at the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse.

- **Business and Politics:**
  Bradley's career trajectory shifted from the wrestling ring to the corporate world. He worked as an area repair supervisor for telecommunications company CenturyLink and later became a manager at Northwestern Mutual. His commitment to the Republican Party grew, and he ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly in 2010. Although he faced defeat in the primary, Bradley remained active in party organizing and eventually stepped into leadership roles.

- **Making History:**
  In 2021, Julian Bradley achieved a significant milestone. He became the first black Republican to serve in the Wisconsin Senate, representing the 28th Senate district. His focus as chairman of the Senate Committee on Utilities includes ensuring reliable energy and broadband access for Wisconsin families and businesses.

Senator Bradley's journey—from wrestling rings to legislative chambers—reflects resilience, determination, and a commitment to public service. His unique path underscores the importance of diverse voices in our political landscape.
