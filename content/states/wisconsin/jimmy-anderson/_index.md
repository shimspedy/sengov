Jimmy grew up in a working-class home and became the first in his family to attend college. After graduating, he pursued law school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and decided to make the Madison area his home. However, tragedy struck during his final year at UW Law School when a drunk driver took the lives of his mother, father, and little brother, leaving Jimmy paralyzed from the chest down.

Despite this immense challenge, Jimmy persevered. He graduated from law school and made a promise to dedicate himself to helping others. He founded a nonprofit organization to support victims of drunk driving. It was during this time that he discovered his passion for service and decided to run for office, aiming to create positive change on a larger scale.

In 2016, Jimmy was proudly elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly. Since then, he has been a strong advocate for his constituents. His focus areas include expanding access to affordable healthcare, improving the lives of disabled Wisconsinites, and safeguarding our environment. Jimmy currently resides in Fitchburg with his roommate (and feline companion), Norman. When he's not busy with legislative matters, you'll find him reading all kinds of books, enjoying movies, and writing in his free time.
