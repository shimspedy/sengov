Born on June 30, 1996, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Angelito Tenorio grew up in the suburb of West Allis. His parents, who immigrated from the Philippines, instilled in him the values of hard work and community service.

In 2019, Angelito successfully ran for a seat on the West Allis City Council, where he served from 2020 to 2022. During this time, he became a prominent advocate for progressive causes, including combating climate change, supporting affordable housing, and championing racial justice and LGBTQ+ rights.

In addition to his political career, Angelito has been deeply involved in community organizing and education. He has worked as a teaching assistant at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he taught courses on community organizing, coalition building, and social change. His dedication to making a difference extends beyond his professional life, as he has been an active leader in various civic and political organizations.
