Karen Kirsch is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the Wisconsin State Assembly. She represents District 7, having assumed office on January 6, 2025. Her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Karen Kirsch's journey into politics is deeply rooted in her commitment to service and advocacy. Raised in a household influenced by the values of the United Steelworkers, she grew up understanding the transformative power of collective action and community support. Her father often shared stories of the post-Depression era, which instilled in her a profound appreciation for the role of unions in shaping better lives for working families.

Karen's academic pursuits began at Madison Area Technical College, where she earned an associate degree. She later continued her education at Mount Mary University, obtaining a bachelor's degree. Her professional career started in advertising, marketing, and public relations, where she worked with nationally acclaimed agencies and collaborated with industry leaders on global brands. This experience honed her communication and strategic skills, which she now leverages in her political career.

Her passion for healthcare reform is a cornerstone of her political platform. Having faced challenges with the healthcare system due to a pre-existing condition, Karen became a staunch advocate for accessible and equitable healthcare. She believes that healthcare is a fundamental right and is dedicated to addressing the systemic issues that hinder families and healthcare professionals alike.

Karen's political career gained momentum as she became actively involved in the Democratic Party of Milwaukee County. Her dedication to progressive causes and her ability to connect with constituents have made her a respected figure in Wisconsin politics. She resides in Greenfield with her partner, Robert Hansen, her stepdaughter Abigail, and their beloved dogs. Her personal and professional experiences continue to shape her vision for a more inclusive and equitable Wisconsin.
