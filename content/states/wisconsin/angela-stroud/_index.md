Angela Stroud is a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing District 73. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Angela Stroud's journey into politics is deeply rooted in her background as an educator and advocate for social justice. Originally from southern Texas, she grew up near the Mexican border, where she witnessed firsthand the challenges of poverty and inequality. These early experiences shaped her commitment to creating a more equitable society. Stroud moved to Ashland, Wisconsin, in 2012 and began teaching at Northland College. As a professor of Sociology and Social Justice, she taught courses on topics such as gender and sexuality, racism, community sociology, and human rights. Her academic work and community involvement earned her a reputation as a passionate and dedicated leader.

In 2024, following redistricting and the decision of the incumbent representative not to seek re-election, Stroud entered the race for the Wisconsin State Assembly. Her campaign focused on increasing public funding for education and advocating for stronger environmental protections. She won the Democratic primary with an overwhelming majority and went on to secure victory in the general election, defeating her Republican opponent with 58% of the vote.

Beyond her legislative work, Angela Stroud is an active member of her community. She lives in Gingles, Wisconsin, with her partner Cynthia, their stepson, and their rescue dog Mae. Stroud's personal and professional life reflects her dedication to fostering inclusivity, equity, and sustainability in her district and beyond.
