Karen Ruth Hurd (née Willa; born 1958) is an American nutritionist, writer, and Republican politician hailing from Eau Claire County, Wisconsin. She has been serving as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 68th Assembly district since January 2023. Notably, she is also an active member of the village board in Fall Creek, Wisconsin.

**Early Life and Military Service:**
Karen was born as Karen Willa in Texas. Her parents' divorce during her childhood led her to move to Missouri, where she graduated from Kirkwood High School in 1976. Later, she attended Truman State University, earning her bachelor's degree in 1980. While in college, she participated in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army upon graduation. Karen served honorably for four years, achieving the rank of captain before her discharge in 1984. Her outstanding service earned her the Army Commendation Medal.

**Advocacy and Nutrition Practice:**
After leaving the Army, Karen focused on her growing family in St. Louis, Missouri. However, a pivotal moment occurred in 1989 when her infant daughter was poisoned by a household pesticide (Organophosphate). Determined to find alternative treatment options, Karen administered a nutrition plan that successfully restored her daughter's health. This experience ignited her passion for nutrition and biology.

She furthered her education by attending the American Academy of Nutrition (now Huntington University of Health Sciences), where she received a diploma in comprehensive nutrition in 1994. Subsequently, Karen established her nutrition practice, Karen R. Hurd Nutrition Practice LLC. Her journey didn't stop there—she moved to Fall Creek, Wisconsin, with her family in the late 1990s.

**Education and Advocacy:**
Karen's thirst for knowledge persisted. She attended courses at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire and ultimately completed her master's degree in biochemistry in 2017 from the University of Saint Joseph (online). An outspoken advocate on nutrition issues, Karen has shared her findings through radio appearances, speaking engagements, and self-published books. Her dedication extends to digital coursework as well.

Currently, Karen Hurd is pursuing a master's in public health from George Washington University (also online). Beyond her political role, she has recently worked as a substitute teacher in the Fall Creek School System.

Karen's multifaceted journey—from military service to nutrition advocacy and political leadership—reflects her commitment to making a positive impact.
