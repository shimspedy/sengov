Karen Hurd is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 69th Assembly District. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end in January 2027.

Born in Texas in 1958, Karen Hurd has had a diverse and accomplished career. She graduated from Truman State University in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and a minor in German. During her time at university, she participated in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army upon graduation. She served in the Army from 1980 to 1984, achieving the rank of captain and receiving the Army Commendation Medal for her outstanding service.

After her military career, Hurd focused on her family and later pursued a career in nutrition. Her interest in nutrition was sparked by a personal experience when her infant daughter was poisoned by a household pesticide. Determined to find a solution, she studied alternative treatment options and successfully restored her daughter's health through a nutrition plan. This experience led her to further her education in nutrition and biology. She earned a diploma in comprehensive nutrition from Huntington College of Health Sciences in 1994 and later completed a Master of Science in Biochemistry from the University of Saint Joseph in 2017.

Hurd established her own nutrition practice, Karen R. Hurd Nutrition Practice LLC, and became an advocate for nutrition education. She has authored several books and digital courses on the subject and has been a speaker on various platforms. In addition to her work in nutrition, she has been involved in her community, serving as a trustee for the Village of Fall Creek and participating in various local organizations.

Her political career began with her election to the Wisconsin State Assembly, where she has been an active legislator. Hurd's dedication to public service is evident in her committee work and her efforts to address the needs of her constituents. She continues to reside in the Town of Withee, Wisconsin, with her family, and remains committed to serving her community and state.
