Born on September 14, 1953, in Lone Rock, Wisconsin, Jerry grew up in Southwest Wisconsin before moving to Lomira during his high school years. He later graduated from Madison West High School in 1971. Jerry pursued higher education at Minnesota Bible College, focusing on Pastoral Studies, and later earned a diploma from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison School of Banking in 2001.

Before entering politics, Jerry had a distinguished career in banking. He served as the President and CEO of the National Exchange Bank & Trust in Waupun, Wisconsin, where he worked for over two decades. His leadership extended beyond his professional role, as he chaired the boards of the Wisconsin Bankers Association and the Community Bankers of Wisconsin. Jerry also held licenses as a real estate broker and insurance agent, showcasing his versatility and commitment to serving his community.

Jerry's political journey began when he decided to run for the Wisconsin State Assembly.

Jerry's personal life is equally rich. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Amy Lansdowne, for nearly 43 years until her passing in 2015. Together, they had two daughters. Jerry later remarried Luanne Bohlman-Romuald, a widow and mother of three. Between them, they have five children and six grandchildren.
