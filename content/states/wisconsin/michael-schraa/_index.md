Michael Schraa, born on April 17, 1961, is an American businessman and politician. Originally from Fort Carson, Colorado, he attended the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. Michael's entrepreneurial spirit emerged earlyâ€”he took odd jobs in his neighborhood, including mowing lawns and delivering papers for the Oshkosh Northwestern by the age of 12.

As an adult, Michael worked as a stock broker for Carl Henning Investments at just 21 years old. Later, he became an investment advisor at Robert W. Baird. His business ventures extended beyond finance; at 27, he became the owner of Leon's Frozen Custard in Oshkosh. Over the years, he has started and sold several other businesses and currently operates an online retail automotive business on eBay.

Michael understands the challenges faced by small business owners within a community. He is a member of the Winnebago County Republican Party, the NRA, and the Wisconsin Wing of the Civil Air Patrol Legislative Squadron (with the rank of Major). Additionally, he raced Late Model Stock Cars at various tracks.

His personal interests include watching the Brewers and Packers, gardening, and making his children laugh. Michael is Pro Life, Pro Family, and Pro Liberty. He is married to Christine and has three daughters: Lauren, Carly, and Annalise. Lauren graduated from Spring Arbor University in Michigan with a major in Social Work and now works at a university in Arizona. Carly holds a Master's degree in Social Work from UW-Madison and is married with one son. Annalise, who graduated from Lourdes Academy, is currently studying at UW-Madison.
