Lisa Subeck is a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 79th Assembly District. She assumed office in January 2015, and her current term is set to end in January 2027.

Born on June 17, 1971, in Chicago, Illinois, Lisa Subeck has dedicated her career to public service and advocacy. She graduated from Rich Central High School in Olympia Fields, Illinois, in 1989 and later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison in 1993. Her early career focused on programs for children and young mothers, including her work as a program director for Head Start and Early Head Start programs in Dane County. She also played a pivotal role in launching Hope House, a housing program for young mothers in Madison.

Subeck's passion for community service led her to teach early education courses at Madison Area Technical College and work as a program coordinator for the Madison YWCA. Her involvement in social programs and advocacy eventually steered her toward a career in politics. In 2005, she made her first attempt at elected office, running for the Madison Common Council. Although unsuccessful in her initial bid, she remained active in local affairs, serving on various committees such as the Community Services Committee and the Equal Opportunities Commission.

In 2011, Subeck successfully ran for the Madison Common Council, where she served until 2015. During her tenure, she championed initiatives to address crime, gang violence, and community development in Madison's Southwest neighborhoods. Her efforts included securing funding for community safety initiatives, a community center, and other neighborhood improvements.

Elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 2014, Subeck has been a vocal advocate for progressive policies. She has focused on issues such as healthcare access, reproductive rights, public education, and environmental protection. As a ranking Democrat on the Health Committee, she has worked to expand BadgerCare and reduce prescription drug costs. She has also introduced legislation aimed at preventing gun violence and addressing poverty through initiatives like the Wisconsin Opportunity Act.

Throughout her career, Lisa Subeck has received numerous awards and recognitions for her contributions to public service and advocacy. She continues to serve her constituents with a commitment to equity, fairness, and community well-being.
