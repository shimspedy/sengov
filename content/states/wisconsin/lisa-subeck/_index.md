Lisa B. Subeck, born on June 17, 1971, hails from Chicago, Illinois. She graduated from Rich Central High School in Olympia Fields and went on to earn her bachelor's degree in Psychology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1993. Subeck's career began with a focus on programs for children and young mothers. She served as a Dane County program director for Head Start and Early Head Start programs and was instrumental in launching Hope House—a Madison-based housing program for young mothers and their infants and toddlers. Additionally, she taught early education courses at Madison Area Technical College and worked as a program coordinator for the Madison YWCA.

Subeck's commitment to social programs and advocacy led her into politics. In 2011, she successfully ran for the Madison Common Council, where she championed community safety initiatives and neighborhood development. Later, in January 2015, she became a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the west side of Madison. As a legislator, she has focused on issues related to energy, utilities, health, aging, and long-term care.
