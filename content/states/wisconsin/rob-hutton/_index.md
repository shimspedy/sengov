Rob and his wife Patti both grew up in Brookfield and graduated from Brookfield East High School, where they met through fellow classmates. They reside in Brookfield today and have enjoyed raising their four children in the same community among their grandparents and extended family.



Rob earned his degree from UW-Whitewater and pursued a career in business with a Fortune 500 company. He then owned a logistics firm in Milwaukee, which provided national trucking and warehousing services for key Wisconsin industries. He now owns two industrial coatings firms that serve Wisconsin’s manufacturing industry employing over 75 people. Rob is also a partner in a metal fabricating firm in southeastern Wisconsin.



As a business owner, Rob has witnessed firsthand how government can both help and hinder the growth of a business and its ability to prosper and create jobs. He will use his private sector experience to identify and eliminate barriers in making Wisconsin the most business friendly state in the country. He understands that economic prosperity and thriving communities go hand-in-hand.



In 2012, Rob was elected to serve as a member of the State Assembly for eight years, representing the 13th District. In his time in the Assembly, he led in important legislation such as Right to Work and eliminating the Prevailing Wage law. Rob also authored and co-authored legislation to reduce the size of government, toughen criminal penalties, and provide tax relief for Wisconsin families and businesses.



He has a proven voting record of reducing government spending, expanding educational choices for all families, protecting life, and ensuring the safety of Wisconsin’s most vulnerable children. While in the State Assembly, he served on the Small Business, Corrections, and Education committees.  



Rob and Patti enjoy spending time together with family, as well as serving in their church and with various community organizations.
