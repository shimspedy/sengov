Adam Neylon is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 15th Assembly District. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born on December 30, 1984, in Elgin, Illinois, Neylon grew up in West Dundee, Illinois, and graduated from Harry D. Jacobs High School in Algonquin. He later attended Carroll University, where he earned a degree in political science in 2008. During his time at Carroll, he was an active member of the baseball team, playing second base.

Neylon's career in politics began with various roles, including serving as a member of The Sensenbrenner Committee Primary Campaign Staff in 2008 and working as an Absentee Ballot Director for the Republican National Committee the same year. He also served as a Congressional Staff member for Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner from 2008 to 2010 and as a Policy Advisor for the Wisconsin State Assembly from 2011 to 2012. In 2010, Neylon ventured into entrepreneurship by starting his own commercial window cleaning business.

In 2013, Neylon was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly's 98th District in a special election. He quickly gained recognition as a rising star within the Republican Party, championing issues such as tax cuts, reduced long-term borrowing, and opposing DNA collection upon arrest. Over the years, he has held significant leadership roles, including serving as Chairman of the Assembly Committee on Jobs and the Economy and Chairman of Wisconsin's Small Business Regulatory Review Board.

Neylon has also been actively involved in various initiatives and task forces, such as the Assembly Speaker's Task Force on Foster Care and the Task Force on Artificial Intelligence. He was selected to attend the Bowhay Institute for Legislative Leadership Development fellowship in 2014, further solidifying his reputation as a dedicated and forward-thinking legislator.

Currently residing in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, Neylon lives with his wife, Hannah, and their two children, Elizabeth Grace and Thomas Robert. His commitment to public service and his community continues to define his career in the Wisconsin State Assembly.
