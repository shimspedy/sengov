Darrin Brian Madison Jr. (born 1996) is an American justice activist and Democratic politician from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He assumed office as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly in January 2023, representing the 10th district. Madison's journey into activism began at a young age when he participated in mass protests against 2011 Wisconsin Act 10, which abolished collective bargaining rights for public employees. Throughout his teenage years, he worked on various social justice campaigns related to youth jobs, education, public safety, sexual health, and environmental justice. Madison graduated from Ronald Wilson Reagan College Preparatory High School in 2015 and later earned his bachelor's degree from Howard University. His commitment to community service continued as an AmeriCorps Public Allies volunteer, working with Milwaukee's Environmental Collaboration Office. In the 2020 general election, he ran for a seat on the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors and subsequently entered the race for the 10th Assembly district, securing victory in the overwhelmingly Democratic district.
