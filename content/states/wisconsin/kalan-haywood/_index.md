Kalan Haywood II, born on June 5, 1999, hails from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He's an American activist and a rising star in Democratic politics. At just 19 years old, he made history by becoming the second youngest person ever elected to the Wisconsin Legislature. Imagine that—stepping into the political arena while most of us were still figuring out how to adult!

**Early Life and Education**
Kalan graduated from Rufus King International High School, and then he embarked on his academic journey. He initially attended Cardinal Stritch University, but alas, it shut its doors in 2023. Undeterred, Kalan now pursues a finance major at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

His father, Kalan Haywood Sr., is no stranger to influence. He's the founder of a real estate development firm, and his legacy casts a long shadow in Milwaukee.

**Career Highlights**
Kalan's résumé reads like a whirlwind of accomplishments. He served as the president of the City of Milwaukee Youth Council, proving that leadership knows no age limits. Additionally, he worked as a non-profit consultant and lent his voice to the City of Milwaukee Restorative Justice Advisory Committee.

But wait, there's more! In 2018, at the tender age of 19, Kalan clinched victory in the Democratic primary election and then triumphed in the general election. That made him not only the youngest person serving in the Wisconsin Assembly but also one of the youngest legislators in the entire United States. 

And here's the cherry on top: In 2021, the Assembly Democratic caucus elected him as their assistant minority leader. Talk about a meteoric rise!
