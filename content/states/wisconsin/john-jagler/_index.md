John Jagler was born in Louisville, Kentucky, but his parents, both originally from Wisconsin, moved to Oak Creek when he was just three years old. He graduated from Oak Creek High School and went on to attend the University of Wisconsin-Parkside and the American School of Broadcasting.

Before entering politics, John spent an impressive 20 years as a radio news anchor, reporter, and show host. He garnered numerous awards for his work hosting the morning show on News Radio 620 WTMJ in Milwaukeeâ€”the state's most listened-to radio station.

In January of 2010, John joined the staff of Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, serving as his Communications Director during the historic 100th Wisconsin Legislative session. He then went on to serve four terms as the Representative of the 37th Assembly District before being elected to represent the 13th Senate District.

Currently, Senator Jagler chairs the Senate Committee on Education and serves as the Vice-Chair of the Senate Committee on Housing, Rural Issues, and Forestry. Additionally, he is a member of the Committee on Insurance and Small Business and the Joint Legislative Council Committee.

John and his wife, Heidi, reside in Watertown, Wisconsin, where they've lived for over thirty years. Together, they have three children.

Senator Jagler remains committed to being your voice in Madison, and he maintains a website to keep constituents informed about his work on their behalf.
