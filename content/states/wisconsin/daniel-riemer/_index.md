Daniel G. Riemer, born on December 10, 1986, hails from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His father, David Riemer, previously served as a policy advisor and budget director for former Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle. Daniel attended Milwaukee Public Schools and graduated from Rufus King High School in 2005. Later, he earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 2009.

However, Daniel's educational journey took an interesting turn when he entered the world of politics. In 2012, he launched a primary challenge against Democrat Peggy Krusick, who had been in the Wisconsin State Assembly for nearly three decades. Despite the odds, Riemer secured victory in the primary and went on to win the general election. Since 2013, he has represented Wisconsin's 7th Assembly district.

In addition to his political career, Daniel Riemer pursued legal studies. He attended the University of Wisconsin Law School, graduating with his J.D. in December 2013. Subsequently, he was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin in April 2014. Riemer has been reelected four times and currently serves on several legislative committees, including Health, Insurance, Veterans and Military Affairs, Ways and Means, and Law Revision.

Outside of politics, Daniel Riemer is also a captain in the United States Army Reserve, serving in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. He balances his commitment to public service with his legal profession.
