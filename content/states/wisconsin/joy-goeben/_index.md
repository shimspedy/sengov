Joy L. Goeben (born October 16, 1972) is an American teacher, business owner, and Republican politician hailing from Green Bay, Wisconsin. She currently serves as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 5th Assembly district since January 2023.

Joy Goeben was born and raised in Green Bay, Wisconsin. She graduated from Green Bay East High School and went on to earn her bachelor's degree in education from the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay. Later, she completed her master's in education at Walden University. Her passion for education led her to work as a teacher in the Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin, public school system.

In addition to her teaching career, Joy wears another important hat: that of a business owner. She opened the Joyful Hearts Family Childcare preschool center, which she successfully operated for a decade. But wait, there's more! She also assists her husband in managing their family business, Classic Carpet Cleaning.

Joy Goeben is deeply involved in her community. She serves on the board of Christ Alone Church Leadership and has been an active member of the non-profit Green Bay Area Christian Homeschoolers.

Political Career:
In the summer of 2022, an opportunity arose when Wisconsin State Assembly incumbent Jim Steineke resigned from office, leaving a vacancy in the 5th Assembly district. Joy Goeben decided to step up and enter the race for the Republican nomination. She faced two opponents in the August 2022 Republican primary and emerged victorious. Her determination didn't stop there—she went on to win the Fall general election, securing 60% of the vote.

Personal Life:
Joy and her husband, Ben, call Hobart, Wisconsin, home. Together, they are raising four wonderful children.
