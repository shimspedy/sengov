Timothy W. Carpenter (born February 24, 1960) is an American Democratic politician who has dedicated over two decades to serving in the Wisconsin Senate. Since 2003, he has represented Wisconsin's 3rd Senate district, which encompasses much of the south side of Milwaukee. Prior to his Senate tenure, Carpenter served an impressive 18 years in the Wisconsin State Assembly (1985–2003).

Born in Milwaukee, Carpenter attended Milwaukee's Casimir Pulaski High School and later pursued higher education. He earned his bachelor's degree in political science and history from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. His commitment to public service led him to the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he obtained his master's degree in 1995.

Carpenter's political journey began early. At just 24 years old, while still a student at the La Follette School, he entered the race for the Wisconsin State Assembly in the 20th Assembly district—a heavily Democratic area in southern Milwaukee. Despite facing five opponents in the Democratic primary, Carpenter secured victory with 27% of the vote and went on to serve nine terms in the Assembly. In 2002, he transitioned to the Wisconsin Senate, where he has continued to advocate for his constituents.

Notably, during the 2007–08 biennium, Carpenter held the position of President Pro Tempore of the Wisconsin State Senate. His dedication to meeting the needs of seniors in Wisconsin earned him the 2007 "Russ Feingold Award for Service" from the Coalition of Wisconsin Aging Groups.

Senator Carpenter remains committed to keeping in touch with his constituents, regularly hosting town hall meetings at libraries and senior centers throughout his district.
