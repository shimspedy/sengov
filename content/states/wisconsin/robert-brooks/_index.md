Robert Brooks is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 59th Assembly District. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born on July 13, 1965, in Rockford, Illinois, Brooks moved to Wisconsin during his youth and graduated from Parkview High School in Orfordville. He attended the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse but did not complete his degree. Brooks ventured into the real estate business and became a successful entrepreneur, managing his investments through Brooks Investment Group LLC since 1996. Over the years, he has owned and operated several restaurants, taverns, and rental properties.

Brooks began his political career as a member of the Ozaukee County Board of Supervisors, serving from 2002 to 2014. During his tenure, he held the position of chairman from 2004 to 2013. His leadership extended to roles such as commissioner on the South Eastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission and a board member of the Wisconsin Mutual Insurance Company.

In 2014, Brooks transitioned to state-level politics, winning his first election to the Wisconsin State Assembly for the 60th District. He served in that capacity until 2025, when he began representing the 59th District. Throughout his legislative career, Brooks has been actively involved in various committees, including those focusing on housing, real estate, Medicaid reform, and state affairs. His dedication to public service has been recognized through his leadership roles, such as assistant majority leader during the 2017–2018 session.

Despite facing challenges, including controversies during his tenure, Brooks has remained a steadfast representative for his constituents. His commitment to addressing local issues and fostering community development continues to define his political journey.
