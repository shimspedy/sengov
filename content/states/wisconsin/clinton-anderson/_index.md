Clinton M. Anderson, born on May 26, 1993, hails from the vibrant city of Beloit, Wisconsin. As a lifelong resident and a proud product of the School District of Beloit, he has left an indelible mark on both local and state politics.

**Education and Early Years**
- Graduated from Beloit Memorial High School in 2011.
- Earned an Associate's Degree from the University of Wisconsin–Rock County in 2016.
- Furthered his education at the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, obtaining a bachelor's degree in psychology in 2018.

**Political Journey**
- In 2016, Clinton made his first foray into elected office, running for the Wisconsin State Assembly in the 31st Assembly district. Although he secured victory in the Democratic primary, he narrowly missed out in the general election.
- Undeterred, he turned his attention to local governance. Elected to the Beloit city council, he served multiple terms, including a one-year stint as council president from April 2021 to April 2022.
- In 2022, fate beckoned again. With incumbent Mark Spreitzer opting not to seek re-election in the 45th Assembly district, Clinton seized the opportunity. He emerged victorious in the Democratic primary and went on to win the general election, securing 55% of the vote.

**Beyond Politics**
Outside the political arena, Clinton's commitment extends to community service. He has worked as a volunteer coordinator at a shelter for survivors of domestic violence, demonstrating his dedication to making a positive impact.

Clinton's family is deeply rooted in Beloit: his father serves as a building inspector for the city, and his mother works as a school district secretary. Even his brother, Spencer Anderson, has contributed as an elected member of the Beloit school board.

Assemblymember Clinton Anderson continues to champion the interests of his constituents, bridging the gap between local concerns and state-level decisions.
