Ben DeSmidt is a Democratic Party member serving in the Wisconsin State Assembly. He represents District 65 and assumed office on January 6, 2025. His current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born and raised in Wisconsin, Ben DeSmidt has dedicated his career to education, business, and public service. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1995 and later pursued advanced studies at Columbia University, where he obtained a Ph.D. in 2006. His academic journey reflects his passion for learning and intellectual growth.

Before entering politics, DeSmidt was an associate professor at Carthage College, where he taught classics and great ideas. His commitment to education extended beyond the classroom, as he also served as a trustee for Gateway Technical College starting in 2022. In addition to his academic endeavors, DeSmidt is a small business owner, co-owning two popular establishments in Kenosha, Wisconsinâ€”Union Park Tavern and Pavle's Lounge. These ventures highlight his connection to the local community and his understanding of the challenges faced by small business owners.

DeSmidt's political journey began when Tod Ohnstad, the previous representative for District 65, announced his decision not to seek re-election in 2024. With Ohnstad's endorsement, DeSmidt entered the race and secured the Democratic nomination with a commanding 70% of the primary vote. In the general election, he faced Republican candidate Brian Gonzales, a former Kenosha police officer, and emerged victorious with approximately 53% of the vote.

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, DeSmidt is committed to addressing the needs of his constituents and advocating for policies that promote education, economic development, and community well-being. His diverse background as an educator, business owner, and public servant equips him with a unique perspective to tackle the challenges facing his district and the state of Wisconsin.
