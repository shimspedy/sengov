Sarah Keyeski is a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Senate, representing District 14. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 3, 2029.

Born Sarah Everson in October 1970, Keyeski grew up on her family’s farm near Cashton, Wisconsin. She pursued her education with a bachelor’s degree from Luther College in Iowa and later earned a master’s degree from Northwestern University in Illinois. After becoming a Licensed Professional Counselor, she dedicated over a decade to working as a mental health counselor in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.

In 2017, Keyeski moved to Lodi, Wisconsin, where she established a private counseling practice. Her commitment to community well-being led her to found the non-profit organization "Lift Lodi," which aimed to engage residents in volunteer activities to enhance the town's environment. Witnessing the mental health challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic further fueled her passion for public service.

Keyeski’s entry into politics was driven by a significant redistricting plan in Wisconsin. In 2024, she ran for the Wisconsin State Senate in the newly redrawn 14th District. Her campaign focused on addressing mental health issues, community development, and education. Despite facing a competitive race against incumbent Joan Ballweg, Keyeski emerged victorious with 51% of the vote.

As a state senator, Keyeski has been actively involved in committees related to agriculture, education, and mental health. Her legislative efforts reflect her dedication to improving the lives of her constituents and addressing pressing issues in her district. Residing in Lodi with her husband Rodney Keyeski and their six children, she continues to balance her roles as a public servant, counselor, and community advocate.
