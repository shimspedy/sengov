Pat Snyder's journey has been one of genuine commitment to his home state. Born on October 10, 1956, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Pat's heart has always belonged to the Badger State. His formative years unfolded in the vibrant backdrop of Milwaukee during the sixties and seventies.

In November 2000, Pat returned to Wisconsin, and the airwaves welcomed him as the morning radio host on AM 550 WSAU. His loyal audience and high ratings attested to his skill behind the microphone. But life had more doors to open.

In 2012, answering the calls of friends and community, Pat decided to run for the 85th Assembly seat. Though he came up short in that endeavor, another opportunity awaited him. That door swung wide, leading him to become the Outreach Director for Congressman Sean Duffy. In this role, Pat engaged with community leaders across various sectors: business, manufacturing, municipal government, health and wellness, non-profit agencies, agriculture, and education. His ability to listen and connect proved invaluable.

Beyond politics, Pat is deeply involved in community organizations. He champions causes close to his heart, including the United Way's Hunger Coalition and Housing and Homelessness Committee. As a member of the Marathon County Department of Social Services Administrative Review Panel, he contributes to shaping policies that impact lives. Additionally, Pat serves as an Aspirus Hospice Volunteer and has spent time on the Schofield City Council.

Pat's personal life is equally rich. He met his wife, Shawn, while attending the University of Iowa, and they've shared 38 wonderful years together. Shawn, a dedicated R.N., works in the Aspirus Dialysis Unit. Their family includes two married children: Amy, an elementary school teacher in Weston, and Daniel, a Quality Assurance Analyst with Epic Software in Verona, WI.

Patrick J. Snyder's story is one of service, community, and a steadfast love for Wisconsinâ€”a tale that continues to unfold.
