Meet Nate. Born in Appleton, Wisconsin, he has lived in the Village of Fox Crossing (formerly known as the Town of Menasha) his entire life. As a first-generation Wisconsinite, he ensures both of his parents (originally from Michigan) never forget their roots.

Nate attended the Neenah Joint School District from kindergarten through high school graduation. He continued his education at the University of Wisconsin - Fox Valley in Menasha and Fox Valley Technical College (FVTC) in Grand Chute. In 2018, he received an associate's degree as an Information Systems Security Specialist.

His professional journey includes work at various local companies, including Festival Foods, Community First Credit Union, ThedaCare, and NOVO Health Technology Group. Currently, Nate works for Outagamie County.

Beyond his professional life, Nate is passionate about hurlingâ€”the national sport of Ireland. He discovered this passion while studying abroad in the Emerald Isle as part of the FVTC International Professional Field Study & Language Immersion program.

In the realm of politics, Nate played a pivotal role in campaigns for now-Senator Rachael Cabral-Guevara and State Representative Elijah Behnke. He also co-founded Winnebago County for Freedom, a grassroots group that has achieved significant success in the county.

Born in 1995, Nate "Gus" Gustafson brings a fresh perspective to the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing his community since January 2023. He is also a member of the Winnebago County board of supervisors.
