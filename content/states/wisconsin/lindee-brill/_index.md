Lindee Brill is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 27th Assembly District. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born Lindee Rae Claerbout on June 27, 1981, in Kohler, Wisconsin, Lindee grew up in Sheboygan County. She graduated from Oostburg High School in 1999 and pursued higher education at Hope College in Holland, Michigan, where she earned a bachelor's degree in Business with a double major in Marketing/Finance and Spanish. During her college years, she also had the opportunity to study abroad at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, which broadened her academic and cultural horizons.

After completing her education, Lindee began her professional career in human resources, working briefly at Sterling Plumbing in Tennessee before returning to her roots in Sheboygan County. Over the years, she held various roles in marketing and human resources for local businesses and nonprofits, including the Sheboygan County YMCA, Oostburg State Bank, Anchor of Hope Health Center, and Samaritan's Hand, an addiction treatment center. Her professional journey reflects her commitment to community service and her ability to adapt and excel in diverse roles.

Lindee's entry into politics came in 2024 when she decided to run for the Wisconsin State Assembly. The 27th Assembly District had undergone significant changes due to redistricting, and Lindee saw an opportunity to represent her community. Despite facing a tough Republican primary against Oostburg village president Brian Hilbelink, she emerged victorious by a narrow margin. In the general election, she secured a decisive win with 67% of the vote, demonstrating strong support from her constituents.

As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Lindee Brill is dedicated to addressing the needs and concerns of her district. She resides in Sheboygan Falls with her husband, Eric, and their three children, Abby, Preston, and Henry. The family lives on a hobby farm, reflecting Lindee's deep connection to her community and her appreciation for rural life. Her journey from a small-town upbringing to a position of political leadership showcases her determination, resilience, and commitment to making a positive impact.
