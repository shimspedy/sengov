Alex Dallman is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing District 39. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born on May 22, 1992, in Markesan, Wisconsin, Alex Dallman has deep roots in his community. He graduated from Markesan High School in 2011 and went on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science from Edgewood College in 2015. His early interest in public service and governance was evident during his college years, where he actively participated in student organizations and honed his leadership skills.

Dallman's professional journey began with his role as an outreach representative for Congressman Glenn Grothman. This position allowed him to engage directly with constituents and gain firsthand experience in addressing the needs and concerns of the community. His dedication to public service extended beyond his professional life, as he also served as the chairman of the Green Lake County Republican Party, a role he held since 2018.

In 2020, Dallman made his entry into electoral politics by running for the Wisconsin State Assembly's 41st District seat. He won the Republican primary with nearly 50% of the vote and went on to secure a decisive victory in the general election. During his tenure representing the 41st District, he focused on issues such as education, economic development, and community safety. His commitment to these causes earned him recognition and support from his constituents.

In 2024, Dallman transitioned to representing the 39th District in the Wisconsin State Assembly. His legislative work has been characterized by a focus on fiscal responsibility, support for small businesses, and advocacy for rural communities. He has served on several key committees, including the Joint Finance Committee, where he has played a pivotal role in shaping the state's budget and financial policies.

Outside of his legislative duties, Dallman is an active member of his community. He is involved with organizations such as the Green Lake County Farm Bureau and the Manchester Rod & Gun Club. His passion for community engagement is further reflected in his participation in local events and initiatives aimed at improving the quality of life for residents in his district.

Dallman resides in Green Lake, Wisconsin, where he continues to be a dedicated public servant and advocate for his constituents. His commitment to transparency, accountability, and effective governance remains at the core of his work in the Wisconsin State Assembly.
