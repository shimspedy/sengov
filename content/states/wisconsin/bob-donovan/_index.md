Bob Donovan is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 61st Assembly District. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born on May 4, 1956, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Bob Donovan has had a long and varied career in public service and community involvement. He grew up in the Jackson Park neighborhood of Milwaukee and graduated from Thomas More High School. Initially aspiring to become a priest, he attended Saint Francis de Sales Seminary but later shifted his focus and attended the University of Wisconsinâ€“Milwaukee, where he studied for two years with the intention of becoming a teacher. However, he left college before completing his degree.

Before entering politics, Donovan worked in various roles, including as a laborer and later a foreman at Milwaukee Solvay Coke & Gas Co., a coal processing plant. After the plant closed in 1983, he took on several jobs, including working as a security officer and in pest control. His diverse work experience gave him a strong connection to the working-class community he would later represent.

Donovan's political career began in the 1980s when he ran as a Republican candidate for the Wisconsin State Assembly. Although his early campaigns were unsuccessful, they laid the groundwork for his future in public service. He later served on the Milwaukee Common Council for 20 years, representing the 8th District from 2000 to 2020. During his tenure, he was known for his focus on public safety, urban revitalization, and community engagement.

In addition to his work on the Common Council, Donovan ran for mayor of Milwaukee twice, in 2016 and 2022, though he was not elected. His persistence and dedication to public service eventually led him back to the Wisconsin State Assembly, where he continues to advocate for his constituents.

Donovan is married to Kathy Donovan, and together they have five children and several grandchildren. He resides in Greenfield, Wisconsin, and remains actively involved in his community. His life and career reflect a commitment to public service, resilience, and a deep connection to the people of Wisconsin.
