Jim Piwowarczyk is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing District 98. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born and raised in West Bend, Wisconsin, Jim Piwowarczyk has a rich background in law enforcement, business, and journalism. He graduated from Kewaskum High School in 1988 and pursued higher education at Moraine Park Technical College and Marian University, focusing on police science and justice administration. His career in law enforcement began in 1994 when he joined the Glendale Police Department, where he served for 15 years and rose to the rank of patrol sergeant. Later, he worked part-time with the Kewaskum Police Department.

In addition to his law enforcement career, Piwowarczyk ventured into entrepreneurship. He co-founded Wisconsin Right Now, a conservative news website that has become a significant voice in Wisconsin's media landscape. His investigative reporting has earned accolades, including recognition from the Milwaukee Press Club. Beyond journalism, he has been involved in real estate through his business, Realty Solutions Group, and has also owned multiple fitness clubs in southeastern Wisconsin.

Piwowarczyk's political journey began in 2024 when he announced his candidacy for the Wisconsin State Assembly. Running as a Republican, he won the election and now represents District 98. His platform emphasizes conservative values, including law and order, parental rights in education, lower taxes, and reduced government regulation. He is also a strong advocate for the Second Amendment and aims to address issues like inflation and border security.

A resident of the Town of Erin, Piwowarczyk is deeply rooted in his community. He has coached youth sports, including basketball and football, and is an avid outdoorsman who enjoys hunting and fishing. He and his wife, Sue, have raised three children and continue to be active members of their local community.
