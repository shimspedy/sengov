Lee Alyson Snodgrass (born February 9, 1969) is an American politician, communications consultant, and campaign organizer. She currently represents the 57th district of the Wisconsin State Assembly, which encompasses Menasha and central Appleton, Wisconsin. Lee is also the second vice chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and serves as the chair of the Democratic Party of Outagamie County.

**Early Life and Career:**
Lee was born in Philadelphia to a paper mill engineer and a registered nurse. Her family eventually moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin, where she graduated from Preble High School in 1987. She continued her education at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, earning a bachelor's degree in English in 1991. After college, she briefly lived in Maryland before returning to Wisconsin. In Appleton, she worked at the Fox River Paper Company as a marketing and communications assistant. Over the years, she transitioned to various roles, including project manager at a communications agency and director of communications & customer care for the Girl Scouts of the Northwestern Great Lakes.

**Political Engagement:**
Lee's involvement in politics began early. As a college student, she volunteered on campaigns for notable figures like Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin State Assembly) and Russ Feingold (United States Senate). She continued her political engagement by volunteering on presidential campaigns for John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. Locally, she supported the Wisconsin State Assembly campaigns of Appleton assemblymembers Penny Bernard Schaber and Amanda Stuck.

**Notable Tweet and Advocacy:**
In 2022, Lee tweeted about parental involvement in education, suggesting that if parents want a say in their child's education, they should consider homeschooling or paying for private school tuition. She later apologized for the lack of nuance in the tweet and encouraged parents to engage with education by participating in parent-teacher organizations or voting for school boards.

Lee Snodgrass remains committed to connecting people, advocating for equity, and finding solutions to improve her community. Her passion extends to issues such as female empowerment, environmental conservation, LGBTQ+ rights, and basic needs.
