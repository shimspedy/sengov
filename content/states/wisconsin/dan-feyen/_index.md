Dan Feyen is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Senate, representing District 20. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 3, 2029.

Born on July 12, 1968, in New Holstein, Wisconsin, Dan Feyen has deep roots in his community. He graduated from New Holstein High School in 1986 and later earned a diploma in printing from Fox Valley Technical College in 1988. His professional background includes a long career in the printing and bindery industry, where he worked for nearly three decades in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.

Feyen's journey into politics began with his active involvement in local organizations and the Republican Party. He served as the chairman of the Fond du Lac County Republican Party for nearly a decade and was also a member of the United States Junior Chamber, where he held the position of president for the Fond du Lac chapter in the 1990s. His leadership roles extended to various community organizations, including the Knights of Columbus and the Elks Club.

In 2016, Feyen entered the political arena by running for the Wisconsin State Senate to represent District 18. He won the election and served in that capacity until 2025. During his tenure, he was elected as the Assistant Majority Leader of the Senate, a position he has held since 2019. Feyen has been a strong advocate for economic development and technical education, chairing committees focused on these areas.

Following the 2024 redistricting, Feyen transitioned to representing District 20 in the Wisconsin State Senate. This district encompasses parts of Fond du Lac, Washington, Sheboygan, Ozaukee, and Dodge counties. His commitment to public service and his community remains steadfast as he continues to work on policies that promote growth and opportunity for his constituents.
