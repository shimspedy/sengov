Angelina Cruz is a Democratic Party member serving in the Wisconsin State Assembly. She represents District 62 and assumed office on January 6, 2025. Her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Angelina Cruz has a rich background as an educator and union leader. Born and raised in Racine, Wisconsin, she is the granddaughter of Mexican migrant workers who settled in the area for its manufacturing opportunities. Cruz graduated from St. Catherine's High School in Racine in 1997 and later earned her bachelor's degree in sociology from the University of Wisconsin–Parkside. She furthered her education with a master's degree in educational policy from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.

Her career began as a public school teacher in the Racine Unified School District, where she taught fifth grade and later worked at Mitchell Middle School. Cruz's involvement in union activities grew significantly after the passage of the controversial 2011 Wisconsin Act 10, which eliminated collective bargaining rights for public sector unions. This pivotal moment inspired her to take on a leadership role within the Racine Education Association, where she became president in 2016. Under her leadership, the union merged with the Racine Educational Assistants Association to form Racine Educators United, making her the longest-serving president in the union's history.

In addition to her work in education and union leadership, Cruz has been actively involved in state-level initiatives. She was appointed to the transition team for Wisconsin's Superintendent of Public Instruction, Jill Underly, in 2021. Her dedication to public service and advocacy for educators' rights eventually led her to run for the Wisconsin State Assembly, where she continues to champion the interests of her constituents in District 62.
