Amanda Nedweski is a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 32nd Assembly District. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born and raised in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, Amanda Nedweski has dedicated her life to serving her community. She graduated from Mary D. Bradford High School in 1994 and went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Parkside in 1998. Her professional career began as a senior technology consultant at Braun Consulting, where she worked with Fortune 500 clients during the technology boom surrounding Y2K. She later transitioned to a role as a senior financial analyst at CNH Global, where she honed her skills in financial planning and analysis.

Amanda's journey into public service began with her involvement in local education issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. She co-founded the Kenosha chapter of Moms for Liberty, a conservative advocacy group focused on school board governance. Her activism led her to run for and win a seat on the Kenosha County Board of Supervisors in April 2022. During her tenure, she served on the Human Services, Legislative, and Executive Committees, where she worked on issues ranging from public safety to economic development.

In 2023, Amanda was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly, initially representing the 61st Assembly District. Her legislative priorities include education reform, fiscal responsibility, and protecting constitutional rights. She is known for her analytical approach to policymaking, drawing on her background in data analysis and economics to craft solutions that improve government efficiency and accountability.

Amanda resides in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, where she enjoys spending time with her family and her two golden retrievers, Lucky and Sunshine. Her commitment to her constituents and her passion for public service continue to drive her work in the Wisconsin State Assembly.
