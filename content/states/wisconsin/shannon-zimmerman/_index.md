Shannon Zimmerman comes from the most modest of beginnings.  He grew up in western Wisconsin.  A compelling story of inspiration, perseverance and commitment.  This small town kid came up tough and by his own admission, has been blessed for his Wisconsin journey.    

Starting his first business in 1996 from the home, that business would become one of western Wisconsin's largest employers.  Professionally, Shannon led the company, Sajan, Inc. to be recognized multiple times by INC Magazine for growth and according to the Milwaukee Business Journal, has been one of the top five public growth companies.

Launching a second business, he, his wife Angel, son Josh and daughter-in-law Mandy also started Belle Vinez Winery.  A great family business located outside River Falls, WI. 

Knowing Shannon, you quickly realize he cares about so much more than just business.  Family is at the center of all things for him.  Married for over 30 years to his school sweetheart Angel, they have two sons, Josh and Nick, who both live right here in western Wisconsin.  It is quite common to spot Shannon at a local Dairy Queen with one or all of his grandchildren, Taylor, Montee, Addy and Harper.

Our future and the future of our families rely upon our collective ability to drive economic growth-become the destination of choice for entrepreneurs, create great jobs, reduce taxes, integrate our businesses with our educational resources and protect or sporting heritage and the beauty and benefits of this wonderful place we call home.
