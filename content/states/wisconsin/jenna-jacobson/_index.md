She currently serves as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 43rd Assembly district since January 2023. Prior to her political career, Jenna graduated from Frederic High School in 2000. She went on to earn a bachelor's degree in consumer financial planning with a minor in organizational leadership and supervision from Purdue University in 2008. Her commitment to community service led her to serve as a trustee in the Village of Oregon, where she focused on housing issues and worked to increase affordable housing while minimizing property tax increases.

In her free time, Jenna enjoys reading, staying active, and meeting new people.
