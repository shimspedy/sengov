Jenna Jacobson is a Democratic Party member serving in the Wisconsin State Assembly. She represents the 50th Assembly District, having assumed office on January 6, 2025. Her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born Jennifer Shannon Imsdahl on February 4, 1982, in Brenham, Texas, Jenna Jacobson grew up in Polk County, Wisconsin. She graduated from Frederic High School in 2000 and pursued higher education at the University of Wisconsinâ€“River Falls before transferring to Purdue University. There, she earned a bachelor's degree in consumer financial planning with a minor in organizational leadership and supervision. Her early career included roles as a financial advisor and analyst, showcasing her expertise in financial planning and literacy.

Jacobson's journey into public service began at the local level. She was elected to the Oregon Village Board in 2017 and re-elected in 2019. Although she faced a setback in her bid for village president in 2021, she returned to the board in 2022. Her commitment to community development was evident through her work with the Oregon Housing Coalition and her role as a housing specialist for Dane County. She also served on the Governor's Council on Financial Literacy and Capability, further emphasizing her dedication to financial education and housing affordability.

In 2022, redistricting created an opportunity for Jacobson to run for the Wisconsin State Assembly. She successfully secured the Democratic nomination for the 43rd Assembly District and won the general election with a significant majority. Her tenure in the Assembly has been marked by her focus on consumer protection, financial institutions, and workforce development, as reflected in her committee assignments.

Jacobson's personal life is rooted in her family and community. She resides in Oregon, Wisconsin, with her husband, Kyle, and their three children. Her experiences as a mother and community advocate continue to shape her legislative priorities, ensuring that she remains a dedicated representative for her constituents.
