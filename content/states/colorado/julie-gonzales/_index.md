Julie Gonzales is an American politician and a member of the Colorado Senate from the 34th district in the City and County of Denver. She has been a member of the Democratic Party since her election in 2018. Gonzales is also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, a political non-profit organization.

Gonzales was born on the San Carlos Apache reservation in Arizona and grew up in south Texas. She is the sixth of seven children born to Gloria and Mario Gonzales. Her father was a rancher and is now a medical cannabis producer in northern New Mexico. She attended Yale University, where she studied History along with Ethnicity, Race, and Migration.

After graduating from Yale University in 2005, Gonzales moved to Colorado. She worked as a community organizer in Denver, where she organized for causes in support of affordable housing, the environment, teachers and workers rights, college-preparatory education, and immigrants rights. In 2006, Gonzales volunteered and caucused for Bernie Sanders' campaign, before being hired by the Colorado Democratic Party, where she served as Morgan Carroll’s persuasion field director during her CD6 Congressional campaign, engaged volunteers, and turned out voters in support of Hillary Clinton. In 2017, Julie was elected by HD5 to serve as a member of the Party’s Central Committee and Executive Committee.

Gonzales was elected in the general election on November 6, 2018, winning 83 percent of the vote over 17 percent of Republican candidate Gordon Alley. She currently serves as the Majority Caucus Chair and is a member of the Senate Finance, Judiciary, Appropriations, and Legislative Audit Committees. In March of 2019, Gonzales was signatory to a letter by the Democratic Socialists of American National Electoral Committee congratulating teachers strikes in Oakland, Los Angeles, West Virginia, Chicago, and Denver.
