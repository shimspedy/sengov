Jeff Bridges is an American politician serving as a member of the Colorado Senate from the 26th district. Located in Arapahoe County, the district includes parts of Aurora, Englewood, Sheridan, Greenwood Village, Cherry Hills Village, and Littleton. Bridges previously served on the Senate Education Committee and Senate Local Government Committee. He currently serves as the Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and sits on the Joint Budget Committee and the Legislative Interim Committee on School Finance.

Bridges grew up in Colorado and graduated from Arapahoe High School in Centennial. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Kenyon College and a Master of Divinity from Harvard Divinity School.

Before running for the Colorado House of Representatives, Bridges worked for U.S Senator Ken Salazar. He also worked as the associate vice president of public affairs of the Union Theological Seminary. Bridges was first elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 2016, representing District 3. He was re-elected to the seat in 2018. In 2019, a vacancy committee elected Bridges to State Senator for District 26, after the resignation of Daniel Kagan.

Even before winning his election to the State Senate, Bridges' biggest wins came from bringing people together around shared valuesâ€”across parties, across ideologies, and even across faiths. He has been successful in building diverse, bipartisan coalitions to pass laws that benefit all of Colorado. He has also protected military lives with bipartisan legislation and protected LGBT rights in a presidential order.
