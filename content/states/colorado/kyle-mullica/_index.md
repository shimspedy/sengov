Kyle Alan John Mullica was born on July 31, 1986. He is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Colorado Senate. He represents District 24, which includes the Adams County communities of Thornton, Federal Heights, Todd Creek, and Northglenn.

Before his tenure in the Senate, Mullica served in the Colorado House of Representatives and represented the 34th district in Adams County. He was elected to the House in the general election on November 6, 2018, winning 60 percent of the vote over 40 percent of Republican candidate Alex Winkler.

In November 2021, Mullica, who is also an emergency room nurse, announced he was running for the open Senate District 24 seat that, after redistricting, covers much of Adams County, including his hometown of Thornton. In the 2022 election, Mullica won the race with over 54% of the vote.

Mullica assumed office in the Senate on January 9, 2023. He currently serves as Chair of the Finance Committee and is a member of the Health & Human Services Committee. His current term ends on January 13, 2027.

Apart from his political career, Mullica has also worked as an emergency medical technician with Presbyterian Saint Luke's Medical Center, a Section 8 and transitional housing counselor with the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, and a housing specialist with the Denver Housing Authority. He has served on the Young Professional Advisory Board for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the city council of Northglenn, Colorado.
