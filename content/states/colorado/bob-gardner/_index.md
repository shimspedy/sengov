Robert S. Gardner, known as Bob Gardner, is a legislator in the U.S. state of Colorado. Born around 1954, he has had a distinguished career in both the military and politics.

Gardner's journey began with his graduation from the United States Air Force Academy in 1976. He served as a missile launch officer in the Air Force, demonstrating his commitment to his country. While serving as an Air Force officer, Gardner pursued further education. He earned a J.D. from the University of Texas in 1981 with honors and a L.L.M. from George Washington University Law School in 1986, specializing in government procurement law.

After earning his law degree, Gardner served in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. He also taught procurement and business law as a member of the Air Force Academy law faculty. After leaving active duty in 1989 at the rank of lieutenant colonel, Gardner transitioned into private practice. He specialized in government contract law, representing public contractors and charter schools. He served on the board of Cheyenne Mountain Charter Academy, which he helped found, from 1994 to 1997 and on the board of the Colorado League of Charter Schools Legal Advocacy Fund. He continues to operate a private law practice in Colorado Springs, Colorado, specializing in government affairs and contracts, business and commercial law, and campaign and election law.

In 2006, Gardner was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Republican. From 2006 to 2012, he represented House District 21, which encompasses western El Paso County and northeastern Fremont County. In the 2016 general election, Gardner was elected to represent Senate District 12. He is currently a member of the Colorado Senate from the 12th district.

Gardner's political activism dates back to 1993 when he served as chair of the El Paso County Republican Party until 1997. He was involved in numerous candidate and issue campaigns in the Colorado Springs area. In 1999, Gardner was treasurer for the Colorado Springs Safety Association, a group opposing a ballot measure to grant police and fire personnel collective bargaining powers. Gardner registered the political committee Citizens for Honest Government to oppose a slate of candidates during Colorado Springs' 2001 city council elections, and distributed fliers critical of four candidates.

Gardner is divorced and has two adult children: Bob Jr. and Laura.
