Elisabeth Epps is an American activist and politician serving as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives for the 6th district. She was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 9, 2023.

Epps was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law.

Epps is the founder of the Colorado Freedom Fund, a non-profit bail fund organization that provides financial support to individuals who are unable to post bail. She is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. In 2023, Epps supported legislation that would ban assault weapons.

Elisabeth Epps, JD, is a mother, community organizer, civil rights leader, and abolitionist who founded and serves as Executive Director of Colorado Freedom Fund. For years she has inspired, shaped, championed, and helped pass critical legislation focused on liberty, justice, and equity in Colorado.

Born and raised in a Black family in the American South, Elisabeth grew up surrounded by love, but also pain. Elisabeth’s mother died of breast cancer at age 33, when Elisabeth was just 9. Her father, now retired, was a 29-year AFA-CWA union member. Elisabeth attended a dozen schools before 12th grade when she became a single parent herself at age 16. After graduating early from high school, with a newborn baby often on her hip, Elisabeth worked dozens of jobs to make ends meet.

A graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law, her first job in Colorado was with the Colorado State Public Defender. After a brief challenging period of housing insecurity, during which her family lived in a coworker’s basement and in motels, Elisabeth, her son, and their ancient dog Carter eventually made their home in Denver, where her son graduated as a scholar and athlete from Denver East High School. As is the case for many students not born to generational wealth, graduate school was not a ticket to financial freedom but instead saddled Elisabeth with crushing 6-figure student loan debt.
