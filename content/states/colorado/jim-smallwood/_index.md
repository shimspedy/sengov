Jim Smallwood, born around 1971, is an American business consultant and politician. He was first elected to the Colorado Senate in 2016. He represents State Senate District 2, which includes the communities of Castle Rock, Parker, The Pinery, Stonegate, and Grand View Estates in Douglas County. Prior to the 2020 reapportionment process that was implemented in 2023, Smallwood represented the former State Senate District 4 in Douglas County which encompassed the communities of Castle Rock, Larkspur, Parker, Franktown, and Castle Pines.

Born in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, Smallwood spent his formative years in Manhattan, Kansas after his father's 22 years of service in the U.S. Army landed the family in Fort Riley, Kansas. He attended Fort Hays State University where he obtained his B.B.A. in Finance. Shortly after college, Smallwood moved to Colorado and started a small insurance brokerage firm. He later grew this firm, expanding his knowledge base and services to include financial advising and employee benefit consulting. He is now president of Employee Benefits for Moody Insurance Agency, where he oversees a department which manages corporate clients and consults on employee benefits and cafeteria plan administration.

Smallwood was appointed to the Colorado Advisory Council for Persons with Disabilities by John Hickenlooper, and has also served on councils assembled by national and statewide insurers and trade associations. Smallwood never held public office prior to his election in 2016 to the Colorado State Senate. During the Senate District 4 general election, Smallwood defeated his Democratic opponent, Christina Riegel, with 69.39% of the votes cast. Given his history in health insurance and small business, Smallwood was designated Chair of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee and appointed to serve on the Senate Business, Labor, and Technology Committee. Smallwood made medical care a focus in the 2018 Legislative Session.
