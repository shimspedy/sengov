Lorena Garcia is an American politician and community organizer from the state of Colorado. She has been serving as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives since January 2023. She represents the 35th district and is a member of the Democratic Party.

Garcia was appointed to the House by the Colorado Democratic Party after the previous incumbent, Adrienne Benavidez, resigned. Benavidez endorsed Garcia as her successor, and a vacancy committee chose to appoint her to the seat. Garcia won 56% of the committee's vote, defeating two other candidates.

Before her political career, Garcia worked for various nonprofits in Colorado. She ran in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2020, but could not collect enough signatures to make the primary ballot.

In terms of education, Garcia earned a bachelor's of fine arts in film, cinema, and video studies from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and an M.B.A. in international business from George Washington University.

Her career experience includes working as a director in a variety of roles and organizations, such as Colorado state director for 9to5, executive director of the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights, executive director of Wyofile, development and strategic communications director for Colorado Youth Matter, and CEO of Colorado Statewide Parent Coalition.

As a legislator, Garcia has been assigned to the Health and Insurance Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Her current term ends on January 8, 2025.
