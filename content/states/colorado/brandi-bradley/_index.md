Brandi Bradley is a state representative from Littleton, Colorado. She is a member of the Republican Party and represents Colorado House of Representatives District 39. This district chiefly includes the rural sections of Douglas County but also includes part of Highlands Ranch, and all of Lone Tree, Larkspur, Castle Pines, Roxborough Park, and Meridian.

Bradley assumed office on January 9, 2023, succeeding Mark Baisley. Her current term is set to end in 2025. In the 2022 Colorado House of Representatives election, Bradley defeated her Democratic Party opponent, winning 58.06% of the total votes cast.

She lives in Littleton, Colorado, and works as a physical therapist. Bradley earned a bachelor's degree from Middle Tennessee State University and a master's degree in physical therapy from Regis University.

As a legislator, Bradley has been assigned to the House Appropriations Committee and the Public and Behavioral Health and Human Services Committee. Her work in these committees, along with her dedication to her constituents, exemplifies her commitment to public service.

In addition to her legislative duties, Bradley maintains a campaign website and a personal Facebook page where she connects with her constituents and shares updates about her work in the Colorado House of Representatives.
