Said Sharbini is an American politician who served as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives, representing District 31. He assumed office on January 9, 2023, and left office on December 31, 2023. Sharbini ran for election to the Colorado House of Representatives to represent District 31 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. However, he resigned from the Colorado House of Representatives on December 31, 2023.

Sharbini earned an Associate of Arts (A.A.) from Gulf Coast State College in 2006, a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in criminology from Florida State University in 2008, and a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Florida Coastal School of Law in 2012. His career experience includes working as an attorney with the Law Offices of Said Sharbini and the Johnson Law Group, LLC, a deputy state public defender with the Office of the Colorado State Public Defender, and the campaign manager of Mike Weissman's 2016 state representative campaign. He also served as the president of the Arapahoe Young Democrats.

In the 2022 general election for Colorado House of Representatives District 31, Said Sharbini defeated Heidi Pitchforth. He received 58.6% of the votes, totaling 13,461 votes. Sharbini advanced from the Democratic primary for Colorado House of Representatives District 31 on June 28, 2022, with 100.0% of the votes, totaling 4,859 votes.

During his tenure, Sharbini was assigned to the following committees: House Judiciary Committee, State, Civic, Military, and Veterans Affairs Committee. Unfortunately, due to the position's low pay, long hours, and the polarized and contentious climate in the state house, Sharbini announced his resignation as a state representative effective December 31, 2023.
