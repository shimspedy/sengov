Meg Froelich is an American politician serving as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from the 3rd district, which includes Greenwood Village, Colorado. She assumed office on January 14, 2019.

Froelich is a native of Englewood, Colorado. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Bryn Mawr College, followed by a Master of Arts in history from the University of Michigan. She also earned a teaching credential in secondary education from the Dominican University of Colorado.

Before entering politics, Froelich worked as a producer for CBS News, A&E Networks, and PBS. She was the co-producer, writer, and director of Strong Sisters, a documentary about female legislators in Colorado. She served as director of the Colorado chapter of NARAL Pro-Choice America and executive director of the Colorado Democratic Party.

After incumbent Democrat Jeff Bridges was selected to fill a vacancy in the Colorado Senate, Froelich was appointed to replace him, becoming the member of Colorado House of Representatives for District 3. Froelich was the lead sponsor of a bill during the 2021 session of the Colorado General Assembly that established a system to regulate surrogacy in the state. Her bill, HB 21-1022, set criteria for contracts used to engage surrogate mothers for intended parents.

In the 2020 elections, Froelich ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. In the general election, she defeated Republican Dean Titterington with 59.1% of the vote.
