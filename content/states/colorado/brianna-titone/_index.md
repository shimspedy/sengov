Brianna Titone is an American politician and scientist, currently serving as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from the 27th district. She serves in the 74th Colorado General Assembly and is the first openly transgender state legislator elected in Colorado and the 4th elected in the United States.

Titone was born and raised in the Hudson Valley region of New York. She earned her bachelor’s degrees in geology and physics from the State University of New York at New Paltz, attending from 1996 to 2002. Titone later earned a master's degree in geochemistry at Stony Brook University, and another master's degree in information and communications technology at the University of Denver. At Stony Brook, Titone’s master's thesis was on the rare-earth element thorium and speciation of fossils and sediments of the Green River Formation. Some of Titone’s research was conducted at Brookhaven National Laboratory using the National Synchrotron Light Source X-26A and X-18B beamlines.

Before entering politics, Titone worked as a mining consultant, geologist, and software developer. For seven years, beginning in high school, Titone was a volunteer firefighter. In 2016, Titone joined the Jefferson County, Colorado Democratic LGBT caucus and was elected its Secretary/Treasurer, and later appointed a "captain at large". Titone declared a run for Colorado House of Representatives HD27 in December 2017. Titone received 50.4% of the vote to win the election with 24,957 votes out of 49,475, a margin of 439.

Titone serves on the Health and Insurance Committee, the Rural Affairs and Agriculture Committee, and the Joint Technology Committee, and was also appointed to the Energy Council. In the 2nd regular session of the 72nd General Assembly, Titone worked to bring back and pass the bill banning the "Gay or Trans Panic Defense". The bill passed on a margin of 98-1-1. Titone won re-election in the most competitive House race in Colorado, earning 29,566 (48.7%) of 60,708 votes against two opponents in the November 2020 election. In the 2022 general election, Titone was re-elected with around 57.7% of the votes cast. Later in November, Titone was selected to serve as caucus chair of the state House majority which is a first for a trans lawmaker to serve in an elected leadership position in a General Assembly.
