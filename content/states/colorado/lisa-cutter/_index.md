Lisa Cutter is a member of the Colorado State Senate, representing District 20. The 20th senate district includes all or part of the communities of Lakewood, Dakota Ridge, Arvada, Fairmount and Evergreen in Jefferson County. Previously, she served in the Colorado House of Representatives from the 25th district in Jefferson County. In 2022, Cutter was elected to the State Senate.

Lisa was born in Colorado and has a deep knowledge and love for her state. Jefferson County is her longtime home and is where she raised her family, started her business and began her career as an elected official. For the past five years, she has worked tirelessly to ensure every Jeffco family has the support and resources they need to thrive.

As an award-winning public relations and communications professional, Lisa launched Cutter Communications in 1998. She believes deep listening and powerful storytelling are the heart of building relationships and communities. Working with business and nonprofit clients, she’s learned about healthcare, banking, law, housing, commercial construction, sports management and even Colorado wines. She started her own business so she could have the flexibility to be a hands-on mother, succeed professionally and step up for her community.

Lisa's legislative priorities include mental health and well-being of everyone in Colorado, particularly the most vulnerable: veterans, seniors, children, persons of color, the disabled and the LGBTQ+ community, quality public education for all, access to healthcare, including reproductive care and mental health parity, safety, including public security as well as wildfire prevention and mitigation, and stewardship and conservation of the beautiful natural environment and resources we enjoy in Colorado.

Lisa has been involved in various community and professional roles such as Precinct Committee co-chair, Jefferson County Dems, Articulation area chair for Jefferson County Bond and Mill Levy Campaign, Founding member of March On, an organization continuing the March on Denver initiative, Organizer, Women’s March on Denver, Leadership Denver Class of 2016 (Denver Chamber of Commerce), Mount Carbon Elementary PTA auction chair and accountability committee.

She has also been involved with non-profits like Women’s Bean Project, board member and past chair of the board, Dolls for Daughters, board member, Underwearness, board member, Season for Nonviolence, committee member.
