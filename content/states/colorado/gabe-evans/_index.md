Gabe Evans is a member of the Colorado House of Representatives, representing District 48. He is a member of the Republican Party. He assumed office on January 9, 2023, and his current term ends on January 8, 2025.

Evans was born in Aurora, Colorado. He served in the U.S. Army from 2007 to 2019. After graduating cum laude from Patrick Henry College with a degree in Government-Strategic Intelligence, he served 12 years in the US Army and Colorado Army National Guard as a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot in command and a school-trained military intelligence officer.

His career experience includes owning and operating a family farm and working as a police lieutenant and a concealed carry firearms instructor. He has also focused his tenure on criminal justice issues. He has sponsored bills aimed at "ensuring public employees get time off for National Guard service and studying whether judicial personnel are being properly trained on how to work with crime victims."

In addition to his role in the Colorado House of Representatives, Evans is running for election to the U.S. House to represent Colorado's 8th Congressional District. He declared his candidacy for the Republican primary scheduled on June 25, 2024.
