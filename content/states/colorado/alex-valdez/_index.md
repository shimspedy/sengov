Alex Valdez is an American politician who is a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from the 5th district in the City and County of Denver. He was born on June 3, 1981, and grew up in Aurora, Colorado. He attended Rangeview High School and graduated in 1999. After high school, he attended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, before transferring to the University of Colorado Boulder. He graduated with a History degree in 2004.

Before his political career, Valdez founded his own company, EcoMark Solar. He started EcoMark during the 2008 recession and grew it into one of Colorado's largest solar companies. However, EcoMark Solar went out of business in October 2022 after struggling to adjust to changes in the solar industry during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Valdez was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in the general election on November 6, 2018, winning 79 percent of the vote over Katherine Whitney, the Republican candidate. He was the first ever first-year legislator appointed to a leadership role in the Colorado House of Representatives. He was named the Chair of the Energy and Environment Committee, Chair of the LGBTQ Caucus, and Chair of the Latino Caucus. He also serves on the State, Civic, Military, and Veterans Affairs Committee and recently founded the General Aviation Caucus.

Valdez is well known for his environmental work, including the Plastic Pollution Reduction Act, Air Toxics, Air Quality Improvements, and Building Energy Codes. His environmental priorities include accelerating vehicle electrification, increasing renewable energy, and reducing air pollution. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, Valdez has championed LGBTQ+ legislation including HIV Prep and cultural competency healthcare bills. He is also recognized for his animal advocacy, specifically Punky's Law. He is openly pansexual.

Valdez had a short run for Mayor of Denver which lasted from November of 2022 to January of 2023.
