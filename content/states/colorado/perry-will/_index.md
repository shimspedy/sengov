Perry Will is an American politician and a retired wildlife officer from the state of Colorado. He is a member of the Republican Party and currently serves as a member of the Colorado Senate. He represents District 5, which includes Pitkin, Gunnison, and Hinsdale counties and portions of Eagle, Garfield, Montrose, and Delta counties.

Before his tenure in the Senate, Will represented the 57th district of the Colorado House of Representatives, based in the northwestern corner of the state, from 2019 to early 2023. He was appointed to the State House following incumbent Bob Rankin's appointment to the Colorado Senate. A vacancy committee met and chose Will from a field of four candidates, including Rankin's wife Joyce.

Prior to his appointment to the legislature, Will had worked for Colorado Parks and Wildlife for 43 years. In the 2022 Colorado House of Representatives election, Will was defeated by Democrat Elizabeth Velasco. Following State Senator Bob Rankin's announced resignation on January 10, 2023, a vacancy committee selected Will to fill Rankin's seat. Will represents the newly-reapportioned Senate District 5.

Perry Will was born in and lives in Colorado. His career experience includes working for the Colorado Division of Wildlife. He assumed office on January 12, 2023. His current term ends on January 13, 2027. Will ran for re-election to the Colorado House of Representatives to represent District 57. He lost in the general election on November 8, 2022.
