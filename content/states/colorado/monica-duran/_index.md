Before getting involved in politics, Duran worked in the dental industry for more than 30 years. She was elected in the general election on November 6, 2018, winning 63 percent of the vote over 37 percent of Republican candidate Arthur Erwin.

During her tenure, Duran has sponsored bills that included creating minimum standards of care for animal shelters and rescues, creating an office to improve work on missing or murder cases involving indigenous people and a bill aimed at protecting domestic abuse victims by preventing abusers from possessing firearms.

In November 2022, Duran was selected to become the majority leader of the Colorado House of Representatives for the 2023 legislative session. She is currently serving as the Majority Leader of the Colorado House of Representatives since January 9, 2023.
