Ruby Dickson is an American politician and economist who served as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives, representing the 37th district from January to December 2023. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

Born and raised in Colorado, Ruby was motivated by her family's economic hardship to pursue a career in economics. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and Chinese from Lawrence University and a Master of Philosophy in economics from the University of Oxford.

In 2014, Ruby began her career in politics as a legislative assistant for Congressman Jared Polis. She then transitioned to the private sector, working as a senior consulting analyst at Optum from 2016 to 2019. In 2020 and 2021, she worked as a research assistant at the Blavatnik School of Government. Since 2021, she has worked as a research economist at Rethink Priorities.

Ruby was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in November 2022. However, she announced her resignation from the legislature effective December 11, 2023, citing the "sensationalistic and vitriolic nature of the current political environment". Despite her short tenure, Ruby's commitment to her constituents and her dedication to economic research have left a lasting impact on Colorado's 37th district.
