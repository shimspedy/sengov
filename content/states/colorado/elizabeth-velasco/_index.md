Elizabeth Velasco is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She is currently serving as a representative in the Colorado House of Representatives for the 57th district.

Velasco was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 9, 2023. She succeeded Perry Will and is the incumbent representative from the 57th district. Velasco is the first Latina to represent this rural-resort part of the state, which is a significant milestone in the political landscape of Colorado.

In terms of education, Velasco earned an associate degree from Colorado Mountain College. This educational background has undoubtedly played a role in shaping her political career and her approach to governance.

Outside of politics, Velasco has had a diverse career. She is the CEO of Global Language Services, an organization that provides language interpretation services for government agencies, focus groups, and community events. This experience has given her a unique perspective on the importance of communication and language in our society. Velasco also served as a public information officer during the Grizzly Creek Fire, demonstrating her commitment to public service and crisis management.

Before her political career, Velasco worked in hotel management. This experience in the private sector has likely contributed to her understanding of business and economics, which are crucial aspects of legislative decision-making.

Velasco's tenure as a representative is set to continue until 2025, and it will be interesting to see how her career and influence evolve in the coming years.
