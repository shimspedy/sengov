Javier Mabrey is a member of the Democratic Party and represents District 1 in the Colorado House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 9, 2023, and his current term ends on January 8, 2025.

Mabrey ran for election to the Colorado House of Representatives to represent District 1 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. He defeated Guillermo Diaz and Kyle Furey, winning 64.8% of the votes.

He earned a B.A. in political science from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2016 and a J.D. from the University of Colorado, Berkeley, in 2019. His career experience includes working as an attorney with the COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project and Faegre Drinker, a summer associate with Faegre Baker Daniels LLP, and a housing law clerk with the East Bay Community Law Center.

In terms of compensation, legislators whose terms began in 2023 receive a base salary of $43,977/year. For legislators residing within 50 miles of the capitol, they receive $45/day as per diem. For legislators living more than 50 miles from the capitol, the per diem is $237/day.

Before his political career, Mabrey faced housing instability and homelessness, which led him to drop out of high school. He later returned to school and worked his way through community college by washing dishes and delivering pizzas. He then went to Berkeley Law School to pursue a career representing tenants facing eviction.
