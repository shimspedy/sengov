Janet Buckner is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Colorado Senate. She represents District 29, which includes a part of Aurora in Arapahoe County. During the 2020 reapportionment process, Buckner's residence moved from senate district 28 to senate district 29. Earlier, she represented District 28 from January 2021 to January 2023.

Before her state senate tenure, she was a member of the Colorado House of Representatives. She represented District 40, which covered a portion of Arapahoe County, from July 15, 2015, to January 13, 2021. Buckner was appointed to her house seat in 2015 to replace her husband John Buckner after his death in office; she kept the seat in the 2016 elections.

She was a professional speech and language therapist until her retirement in 2007. In the state house, Buckner served as the vice chair of the House Education Committee and also served on the House Health, Insurance, & Environment Committee. After her appointment to her House seat in 2015, Buckner was elected to keep her seat in 2016, winning with 57.69% of the vote against Republican opponent Todd Brophy.

During the 2018-2020 session, Buckner served as the Speaker pro Tempore of the House of Representatives. Since 1975, Janet Buckner has been a staple of the Aurora community. She and her late husband, John, chose Aurora so their family could flourish. Her family includes her twin daughters, Joy and Jennifer; her son, Jay; Jennifer’s husband, Floyd, and Jay’s wife, Erin; and three granddaughters.

Janet earned her bachelor’s degree from Ball State University in Indiana. Early in her career, she worked with children and families as a speech and language therapist. She retired in 2007 after more than three decades in medical sales.
