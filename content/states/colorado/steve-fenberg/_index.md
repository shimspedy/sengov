Stephen Fenberg, born on January 2, 1984, in Toledo, Ohio, is an American politician who serves in the Colorado Senate from the 18th district since 2017, as a member of the Democratic Party. He serves as President of the Senate and served as Majority Leader from 2019 to 2022.

During his time at the University of Colorado Boulder, he founded New Era with Leslie Herod and Joe Neguse and registered 150,000 voters while serving as its director. He was elected to the Colorado Senate in the 2016 election and reelected in 2020.

Fenberg was born in Toledo, Ohio, to Bill and Harriet Fenberg. His mother distributed party literature from the Ohio Democratic Party during the 1990s. He married Lindsay Urban, with whom he has one child, on June 26, 2017, in Lyons, Colorado, conducted by the Jewish spiritual leader of the Jewish congregation in Boulder. He graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a bachelor's degree in environmental policy. He worked as the chief of staff for the student union while at college.

Fenberg founded New Era, an organization which attempts to register young voters, along with Leslie Herod and Joe Neguse while attending college in 2006, and served as its executive director during which the organization registered 150,000 voters.

Senator Rollie Heath, a member of the Democratic Party from the 18th district, was term-limited during the 2016 campaign and Fenberg ran to succeed him. He won the Democratic nomination without opposition and defeated Republican nominee M. Peter Spraitz. He won reelection in the 2020 election against Republican nominee Peg Cage.

In 2017, Fenberg was appointed to serve on the Agriculture, Natural Resources and Energy, State, Veterans, and Military Affairs, and Transportation committees. Fenberg defeated Rachel Zenzinger in the Democratic caucus for the position of Majority Leader on November 8, 2018. On February 9, 2022, he was selected by the Democratic caucus to replace Senator Leroy Garcia as president of the state senate, due to Garcia resigning from the state senate, and assume the office on February 22.
