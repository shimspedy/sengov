Senator Nick Hinrichsen represents Pueblo and Senate District 3 at the State Capitol, serving as Vice Chair of the Business, Labor & Technology Committee and as a member of the Transportation & Energy Committee. He is an Army veteran who fought in the Iraq War and served with NATO peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and the Colorado National Guard. Senator Hinrichsen joined the State Senate after winning a vacancy committee appointment to succeed former Senate President Leroy Garcia in February 2022 and was reelected to represent Senate District 3 in November 2022.

Nick is no stranger to hard work and knows what it takes to put food on the table in Pueblo, working years of long days and nights in Pueblo's logistics industry to build a better life for his family and his community. While raising a child with developmental challenges, Nick put in the time to earn his Masters in Public Administration at CU Denver.

Previously, Nick served as Pueblo Transit's Operations Supervisor, ensuring that the transportation lifelines that sustain Pueblo's economy, workforce mobility, and senior and family living are running on time and on budget.

In February of 2020, Nick developed the first public transit agency-wide pandemic response plan in Colorado. This plan reduced the risk of virus transmission on buses and inside public transit facilities, minimized service reductions, and ensured that there were no shut-downs throughout the duration of the pandemic. He also worked alongside other local agencies and nonprofits to help fund free rides throughout the school year for all Pueblo K-12 students.

Nick lives in the south side of Pueblo with his wife Bri and son Noel.
