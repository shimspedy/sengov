Kevin Van Winkle was born in 1981 and is a Colorado politician. He is a member of the Colorado Senate, representing the 30th district in Douglas County. Before this, he served in the Colorado House of Representatives from the 43rd District, which encompassed Highlands Ranch, Colorado.

Van Winkle is a member of the Republican Party and owns a small business based in Highlands Ranch. He earned a bachelor's degree from Metropolitan State University of Denver.

Van Winkle was first elected to the State House in 2014, winning 63.3% of the vote against his Democratic challenger in the general election. Running for re-election in 2016, he again beat his Democratic opponent, winning 60.34% of the vote.

In December 2020, Van Winkle promoted allegations of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, pushing conspiracies about Dominion Voting Systems and endorsing a petition that falsely claimed that there was fraud in the election.

Following the resignation of state senator Chris Holbert, a Republican vacancy committee appointed Van Winkle to represent District 30 in the State Senate. He was sworn in on June 13, 2022.

In the 2022 elections, Van Winkle was a candidate to represent the newly reapportioned District 30 in the Colorado Senate. The district includes a part of northern Douglas County. Van Winkle's candidacy was successful. In the general election for Senate district 30 held on November 8, 2022, he defeated his Democratic Party opponent, winning 53.82% of the total votes cast.
