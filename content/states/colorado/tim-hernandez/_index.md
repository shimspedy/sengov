Tim Hernández is an American schoolteacher, activist, and a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from the 4th district. He assumed office on September 12, 2023, and was appointed to the chamber in August 2023 by a vacancy committee. He is the first member of Generation Z to hold a state office in Colorado. A member of the Democratic Party, Hernández advocates a progressive platform including support for gun control and affordable housing.

Hernández was born on February 25, 1997, in Pueblo, Colorado, into a Chicano family, and grew up in North Side, Denver. He went to the University of Northern Colorado and served as the president of the student body between 2015 and until his graduation in 2019.

Before being elected to the Colorado House of Representatives, Hernández was a teacher at Aurora West College Preparatory Academy in Aurora, Colorado, and earlier worked at North High School. He is a member of the Colorado Education Association, and was previously a board member of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association.

Hernández began working at North High School in Denver teaching Mexican American literature and English in January 2021. According to Hernández, towards the end of the ongoing academic year, the school did not have enough money to keep him as a teacher, but offered him an associate teaching position for the 2021–2022 academic year under a one-year contract, which he accepted. In December 2021, a group of students at North High School, spearheaded by Hernández, wrote a photography and poetry book, titled Our Sacred Community. The book describes the lifestyle of Latinx students growing up in the gentrifying North Side, Denver. Along with being free to read online, students were selling physical copies of the book for $10 to fundraise for a student leadership conference they were planning on hosting. In May 2022, after Hernández conducted an interview with North High School, he was told by the school in a meeting that he did not interview well enough, and so his contract with the school would not be renewed.
