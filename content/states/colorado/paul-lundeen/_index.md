Paul Lundeen is a distinguished member of the Colorado State Senate, representing District 9. He is a Republican and resides in Monument, Colorado. Lundeen's political career is marked by his commitment to the principles of smaller government and freer people. He believes in the power of the free market to naturally eliminate outdated ideas and businesses over time, as opposed to government bureaucracies which tend to expand even when proven inefficient.

Before his tenure in the Senate, Lundeen served in the Colorado House of Representatives as the representative from the 19th District, which encompassed portions of El Paso County, including the communities of Black Forest, Calhan, Ellicott, Gleneagle, Monument, Peyton, Ramah, and Woodmoor. His dedication to his constituents and his principled stance on issues earned him respect and recognition.

In addition to his political roles, Lundeen is also a successful businessman. He is the founder of numerous small businesses providing services ranging from brain training & learning centers to real estate development to golf course association landscape management, and investment management. His experience as a small business owner for over 30 years gives him a unique perspective on the impact of government regulations on job-creating entrepreneurism.

Lundeen's commitment to education is noteworthy. As a former Chairman of the Colorado State Board of Education, he stands out as one of the nation's leading defenders of parental choice in education and academic free markets. He has worked tirelessly to advance the cause of charter schools, innovation, and choice in education, supporting the right and responsibility of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.

Lundeen's educational background includes being a Regent Scholar at the University of Nebraska and graduating from New York University, where he studied journalism and economics. After graduation, he served as a Washington correspondent with credentials to the White House.

Paul Lundeen is not just a politician and businessman, but also a family man. He and his wife Connie have been married for 33 years and have raised their two adult children in Colorado.
