Rose Pugliese is a state representative from El Paso County, Colorado. A Republican, Pugliese represents Colorado House of Representatives District 14, which, after 2020 reapportionment, encompasses northern El Paso County, including much of the city of Colorado Springs.

Background:
Rose Pugliese is a proud first-generation American. Her father immigrated from Italy to America when he was 18 years old. He came to our great country with 50 cents in his pocket and a dream to start a new life. Rose’s maternal grandparents also immigrated from Italy. Her grandfather, a union worker, felt very strongly about the need to be engaged in politics and would take her to political events as a young girl. Rose’s parents raised her and her two sisters, all while being entrepreneurs and opening a small Italian restaurant on Long Island in New York.

Education:
Rose went on to be the first woman in her family to graduate college, with honors, from Villanova University, as a sociology major with a Japanese minor. She then obtained her Juris Doctorate from St. John’s University School of Law.

Career:
Rose is an attorney. She earned a bachelor's degree from Villanova University and a Juris Doctor degree from St. John's University School of Law. Pugliese served two terms as Mesa County Commissioner from 2013 to 2021. She moved from Mesa County to Colorado Springs in late 2020. In the 2023–2024 General Assembly session, Pugliese serves as assistant minority leader.

Elections:
In the 2022 Colorado House of Representatives election, Pugliese defeated her Democratic Party opponent, winning 27,250 votes (60.67%) to her opponent's 17,665 votes (39.33%).

Personal Life:
Rose is a single mother with two young children. She raises them in Colorado Springs near her relatives. Rose is still very committed to her children’s school and community and volunteers with the PTA. She also works on pro bono projects as the need arises. Throughout her career and during her time as a County Commissioner, Rose worked on many projects that promoted a better and safe place to live and grow for her children and all of the children of Colorado.
