Dylan Outerbridge Roberts, born on July 17, 1989, in Denver, Colorado, is an American politician and attorney who is a Democratic member of the Colorado Senate. He represents District 8, which includes all or part of Clear Creek, Eagle, Garfield, Gilpin, Grand, Jackson, Moffat, Rio Blanco, Routt, and Summit counties, including the communities of Steamboat Springs, Edwards, Craig, Gypsum and Eagle.

Roberts was born to parents Stu and Lulu Roberts. When he was in the fourth grade, Roberts and his family moved to Steamboat Springs, Colorado. In 2008, Roberts took a semester off of college to return to his hometown to work for the Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign. Roberts opened and ran the Steamboat Springs office, the first ever presidential field office in the region. Roberts later returned to Boston College, where he earned his bachelor's degree in political science and environmental studies in 2011. Roberts later graduated from the University of Colorado Law School.

After receiving his degree, he returned to Colorado to serve as the deputy state field director for the Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign. That year, Roberts led over thirty staff members in sixteen offices across twenty-two Colorado counties. During his legal studies, Roberts worked for state representative Mike Foote as a legislative policy analyst, for the Colorado Attorney General, and as a student attorney representing indigent citizens who were charged with crimes and could not afford an attorney. Following law school, Roberts moved to Eagle County and now works as Deputy District Attorney for Eagle County. His work includes prosecuting felony and misdemeanor cases on behalf of victims of crime, including domestic violence, theft, and other crimes.

Roberts was sworn in as a Colorado State Representative on November 13, 2017. During Roberts' first year in the legislature, he was the primary sponsor of twelve bills, six of which were successfully passed and sent to the Governor. During his second year, Roberts was the primary sponsor of thirty-five bills, twenty-nine of which were passed and signed into law by the governor. During this session, Roberts wrote and passed a first-in-the-nation cap on insulin co-pays that has now passed in many other states.

In 2022, Roberts ran for the State Senate and won the race. He assumed office on January 9, 2023. Previously, from 2017 to 2023, Roberts served in the Colorado House of Representatives and represented the 26th District, which included Eagle and Routt counties.
