Robert "Bob" Marshall is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from the 43rd district, which includes most of Highlands Ranch. He was elected in 2022 and assumed office in January 2023.

Marshall was born and raised in Evergreen, Colorado. After graduating from Georgetown University, he joined the Marines. He later attended Cornell Law School and worked as a senior defense counsel and then station judge advocate at a Marine Corps Air Station in Japan. He also served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

After his military service, Marshall earned an LLM in Tax Law from the University of San Diego School of Law and worked at the IRS. He was a Republican for over 30 years, but became a Never Trumper in 2017 over the party's embrace of Donald Trump and Trump's negative statements made towards the family of Humayun Khan. The GOP's embrace of US Senate candidate from Alabama and alleged sexual predator Roy Moore caused Marshall to defect from the party, though Marshall stayed politically unaffiliated until he joined the Democratic Party in 2021.

Before his candidacy, Marshall was active in local county politics. He sued the Douglas County School Board back in early 2022, accusing them of allegedly violating Colorado's open-meetings law before they terminated the superintendent which seen as a controversial decision. Marshall ran unopposed in the Democratic primary election in early 2022 and was set to face Republican Kurt Huffman in the general election. The district was considered Republican-leaning but politically competitive.

During his campaign, Marshall focused on issues like public safety, public education, and the environment. He also emphasized his military background and patriotism during the campaign. In an effort to reach voters, Marshall drove a World War II era Jeep plastered with campaign materials around the district and aired a commercial on Fox News positioning himself as a "Truman Democrat" who dislikes "communists" and "fascists" and who ran to advance "public safety, public education and the environment."

In the 2022 Colorado House of Representatives elections, Marshall defeated incumbent state Representative Kurt Huffman by over 400 votes, flipping the district and making him the first Democrat to represent the district and first Democrat elected from Douglas County since 1966.
