Eliza Hamrick is an American politician and former educator who is currently serving as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from the 61st district. The district is located in Arapahoe and Douglas counties and includes portions of Aurora, Centennial, and unincorporated areas nearby.

Before her political career, Hamrick worked as a high school teacher at Cherry Creek School District for over 30 years. She graduated from the University of Arizona and moved to Colorado, where she became a teacher.

In the 2022 general election, Hamrick defeated the Republican and Libertarian candidates. Her legislative priorities include education, supporting working families, and working on gun legislation.

As of the 2023 legislative session, Hamrick is a member of the Education and Public & Behavioral Health & Human Services committees. She has championed legislation to promote apprenticeship programs, support Coloradoâ€™s workforce, and boost funding for K-12 education. She also sponsored legislation to raise the minimum age to purchase a firearm to help keep schools and communities safer.

On a personal note, Hamrick has been married to her husband, an Air Force veteran, for over 30 years and they have children and grandchildren.
