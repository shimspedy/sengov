Anthony Hartsook is a state representative from Parker, Colorado. A member of the Republican party, Hartsook represents Colorado House of Representatives District 44, which includes the Douglas County communities of Parker, Stonegate, Sierra Ridge, Meridian Village, and Stepping Stone.

Hartsook served for 26 years in the United States Army, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. During his service, he was deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan. Together with his wife, he has owned and run a small business in Parker for ten years.

In the 2022 Colorado House of Representatives election, Hartsook defeated his Democratic Party and Libertarian Party opponents, winning 57.20% of the total votes cast. He assumed office on January 9, 2023, succeeding Kim Ransom.

Hartsook holds a Master’s in Administration from Central Michigan University, and a Bachelor of Science in Biology from Northern Arizona University. He is a graduate of the Army’s Command and General Staff College, and a graduate of the Leadership Program of the Rockies.

Born in Inglewood, California, and graduated high school in San Diego, Hartsook is the son of a construction family. He learned early the value of hard work and dedication to service. After retiring from the Army, Anthony served as Director for Business Development for a Veteran Owned and Service-Disabled Small Business. He also served as Legislative Affairs Assistant for U.S. Representative Mike Coffman, focusing on support for local businesses, veterans’ healthcare, education, defense budget, and national security.

Anthony and his family love the Colorado outdoors and enjoy working and serving in their community. He is a husband and father, soldier and a statesman, small business owner and your Republican representative. Elected to House District 44 in 2022, Anthony has fought against government overreach and passed common sense legislation.
