David Daniel Ortiz is a Democratic member of the Colorado State House of Representatives. He represents Colorado's 38th House District, which is situated in western Arapahoe County and includes the community of Columbine Valley as well as most of the town of Littleton and the Southglenn neighborhood of Centennial.

Ortiz was born on May 25, 1982, in Rapid City, South Dakota. He attended St. Thomas University where he earned his Bachelor's degree. His political career began when he assumed office on January 13, 2021, succeeding Richard Champion.

In addition to his legislative duties, Ortiz sits on both the House Public & Behavioral Health & Human Services Committee and the Health & Insurance Committee. He has the distinction of being the first bisexual legislator and the first wheelchair user to serve in the chamber.

Before his political career, Ortiz served as a pilot in the U.S. Army. In 2012, he survived a helicopter crash while serving in Afghanistan, which left him paralyzed from the waist down. Following his recovery at Craig Hospital, Ortiz worked as a lobbyist for veterans and behavioral health issues through the United Veterans Committee.

Ortiz was elected to the state House in 2020, defeating newly appointed Republican Representative Richard Champion. After a 400-vote loss in the district two years prior, HD38 was a major target for state Democrats during the 2020 cycle.

During the 2021 legislative session, Ortiz was the prime sponsor for 24 bills, more than any other freshman House representative. These sponsored bills included one that adopted the public accessibility standards established in the Americans with Disabilities Act into Colorado state law.

In October 2023, Ortiz announced that he would not seek re-election to a third term in 2024, endorsing Littleton mayor pro tem Gretchen Rydin as his successor.
