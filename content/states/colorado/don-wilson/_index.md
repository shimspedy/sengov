Don Wilson is a member of the Colorado House of Representatives, representing District 20. He is a member of the Republican Party. He assumed office on January 9, 2023, and his current term ends on January 8, 2025.

Before his current position, Wilson served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He also served as the mayor of Monument, Colorado. Since moving to Colorado as a kid, Representative Don Wilson has always been service oriented in the community, state, and country. As a teenager, he was a volunteer youth counselor and sports coach.

In addition to his role as a state legislator, Wilson is an aeronautics instructor to middle school aged students for a STEM program throughout the state. He was elected to the Town of Monument Board of Trustees in 2016, and served as Mayor Pro-Tem until 2018, when he was elected Mayor.

As the Mayor, he took a strong interest in the way state policy was often harmful to the needs of smaller communities. He has served as a member of the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments, the I-25 GAP Coalition, the I-25 Steering Committee, Pikes Peak Regional Building Commissioner, and the Monument Economic Development Committee.

While serving as the Mayor of the Town of Monument, in 2019, Wilson Co-Sponsored the Referendum against The National Popular Vote (SB 19-042), with then Commissioner Pugliese. This effort was the first of its kind in over 80 years and was one of the largest citizen-led initiatives Colorado has ever seen. The effort spanned the entire state, engaging Coloradans from every county, making Colorado the first and only state to allow its people to vote on the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.
