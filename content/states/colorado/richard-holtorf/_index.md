Richard Holtorf is an American politician and rancher currently serving as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from the 63rd district. This district includes all or part of Logan, Morgan, Phillips, Sedgwick, Washington, Weld, and Yuma counties, including the communities of Sterling, Fort Morgan, Brush, Yuma, and Wray. Prior to 2023 and reapportionment, Holtorf represented the 64th house district. He assumed office on December 28, 2019.
