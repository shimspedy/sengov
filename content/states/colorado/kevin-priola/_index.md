Prior to decennial redistricting, he also represented the 25th district. Before his tenure in the state senate, he served in the Colorado House of Representatives from the 30th and 56th districts from 2009 to 2017.

He switched parties to the Democratic Party on August 22, 2022, citing Republican attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. Priola was redistricted into the 13th district.
