Judy Amabile is an American politician and businesswoman who is currently serving as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from the 49th district. Prior to 2023, she served the 13th district. She was elected in November 2020 and assumed office on January 13, 2021.

Amabile was born as Judith Amabile and is affiliated with the Democratic party. She is a resident of Boulder, Colorado, U.S. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and Master of Business Administration from the University of Colorado Boulder.

Before entering politics, Amabile worked as a consultant for Coopers and Lybrand. She also co-founded Product Architects, Inc. and Good Business Colorado. She succeeded former Speaker KC Becker when she was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in November 2020.

In her personal life, Amabile and her husband, Robert Heiberger, had three sons before divorcing. Despite their divorce, Amabile and her husband have remained business partners.

As a State Representative in the Colorado General Assembly since 2020, Amabile has sponsored a strong slate of progressive and pragmatic bills. These include measures to increase mental health resources, improve the criminal justice system, increase gun safety, and make communities more resilient in the face of wildfires fueled by the climate crisis.

Amabile moved to Colorado as a child and is passionately devoted to the state and its people. Throughout her life and business career, she has helped bring real solutions to bear on significant challenges. She co-founded, owned and for 25 years operated Polar Bottle, a business that manufactures sport water bottles.

Amabileâ€™s son developed a serious mental illness at the age 18. She was inspired to seek public office after experiencing our broken mental health care system firsthand. Managing a growing business, caring for up to 65 employees, and parenting three boys has informed every part of her life and work in the General Assembly.

In 2023, Amabile was recognized by an array of community organizations, reflecting the diversity of her legislative leadership. Her notable legislative achievements in 2023 include leadership on gun safety reforms and mental health.
