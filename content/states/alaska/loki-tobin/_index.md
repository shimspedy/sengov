Born and raised in Nome, Alaska, Senator Löki Gale Tobin is a University of Alaska Anchorage graduate and holds a master’s degree in rural development from the University of Alaska Fairbanks Peace Corps Master’s International Program, having served as a Youth Development Volunteer in Azerbaijan from 2008-2011. Currently, she's a PhD candidate at the University of Alaska Fairbanks; her research topic is focused on culturally responsive education. Löki has worked in marketing and communications for Alaskan nonprofits like Boys & Girls Clubs, Kawerak, and the Alaska Community Foundation. She was also a certified fundraiser for the Anchorage Museum at Rasmuson Center. Löki met her mentor, Tom Begich, on one of his many trips to Nome. This started a long friendship that eventually led to her joining his legislative team in Juneau as Policy Director, where for the past several years Löki has worked to serve Alaskans by expanding universal, voluntary pre-K across Alaska, protecting renters and homeowners from predatory insurance practices, and recognizing the resiliency and continued saliency of the Alaska constitution. Löki is active on several nonprofit boards and cares deeply about serving her community and doing good in the world. She's an avid bicycle commuter and community volunteer.
