Calvin Schrage is a lifelong, third-generation Alaskan, deeply rooted in the community. He attended our local schools Abbott Loop Elementary, Hanshew Middle School, and Service High School. After completing his education, Calvin earned a bachelor's degree in Accounting from the University of Alaska Anchorage and began his professional career as the Executive Director of Frontier Tutoring.

Calvin is committed to our community. He actively engages in various volunteer efforts, such as organizing neighborhood food drives and participating in community cleanups. Calvin has served on the boards of the Abbott Loop Community Council and the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce, working on local issues, and supporting the local business economy.

In 2020, Calvin was elected as a State Legislator, representing the district he grew up in. He brings a practical approach to governance; prioritizing community needs over party politics. His focus includes creating good jobs, strengthening educational opportunities, and working to improve the health and safety of our communities.

Calvin and his wife, Heather, have made their home in the very house Calvin grew up in where they are now raising their first child, Eleanor. In his free time, Calvin enjoys outdoor activities like flying as a private pilot, hunting, fishing, hiking, and spending quality time with the family at their cabin in McCarthy.

Calvin remains honored to serve the community that has given him lifelong connections and friendships, and he is committed to making it an even better place for everyone to live and thrive.
