Jesse Bjorkman is a member of the Republican Party and represents District D in the Alaska State Senate. He assumed office on January 17, 2023, and his current term ends on January 21, 2025. He ran for election to the Alaska State Senate to represent District D and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Before his political career, Jesse Bjorkman had a diverse professional background. He worked behind a meat counter, operated a crane in a paper mill, and managed an archery shop. He also has over a decade of experience as a teacher at Nikiski Middle/High School.

In addition to his work experience, Bjorkman served three years on the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly. His commitment to public service is evident in his legislative work. He has sponsored several bills, including those related to lumber grading programs, tax exemptions for farm use land, state park permits for disabled veterans, compensation for wrongfully seized game, and residential building codes, among others.

Bjorkman's committee assignments for the 33rd Legislature (2023-2024) include the Senate Community & Regional Affairs Committee, Senate Education Committee, Senate Labor & Commerce Committee (Chair), and Senate State Affairs Committee.

In the 2022 elections, Bjorkman won the ranked-choice voting election in round 2 with 53.6% of the total votes. His victory was a significant achievement, considering there were no incumbents in the race.

Jesse Bjorkman is not just a politician; he's a husband, a father, and a hard-working Alaskan. He ran for the Alaska State Senate to fight for hard-working, freedom-loving families. His diverse career experience and commitment to public service make him a unique and dedicated representative for the people of Alaska's District D.
