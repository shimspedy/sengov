DeLena Johnson, state representative for District 11, Palmer, Alaska grew up in Talkeetna, a small community with less than 900 people. She graduated from Susitna Valley High School in 1981, married her husband, Steve Johnson, and went on to earn a bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics from UAA and an associate degree in Electronics from Mat-Su College.

DeLena and Steve raised and schooled their five children in Palmer and now have three grandchildren. In 1984, DeLena started an award-winning property development company specializing in unique Alaskan properties. She went on to serve as president of the Palmer Museum of History and Arts, and she served two terms as Mayor of the City of Palmer, eventually being elected President of the Alaska Conference of Mayors.

DeLena has been elected three times to serve in the Alaska State Legislature. In the 30th State Legislature she served on the House Resources, State Affairs, and Energy Committees. She was elected House Minority Whip while serving in the 31st Alaska State Legislature and was a member of the Education, Legislative Ethics, Legislative Council, and Rules committees. Currently serving in the 32nd Alaska State Legislature, she is serving on the Finance Committee, Legislative Ethics Committee and the Judiciary, University, and Commerce and Economic Development finance subcommittees.
