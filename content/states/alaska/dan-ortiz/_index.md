Daniel H. Ortiz, often known as Dan Ortiz, is a distinguished member of the Alaska House of Representatives. He has been serving the 1st District since 2015. Interestingly, he is one of the three non-affiliated members in the Alaska State Legislature. Despite not being affiliated with any political party, he caucuses with the Democratic-led majority for purposes of committee assignments.

Ortiz was born in Ottawa, Illinois, and later moved to Alaska. He has been a resident of Alaska for over 50 years, living in Hydaburg, Wasilla, and primarily Ketchikan. He is a proud husband to Lori and a father to three children: Molly Kate, Lucy, and Sam.

Before his political career, Ortiz was a dedicated educator. He spent 32 years teaching economics and history. He also coached cross-country, basketball, and drama-debate-forensics (DDF) teams. His commitment to education is evident in his academic background. He holds a Bachelor’s Degree from Seattle Pacific University and a Master’s Degree from the University of Wisconsin.

In November 2014, Ortiz decided to run for office to succeed retiring Representative Peggy Wilson of Wrangell. Despite facing stiff competition from Wilson's endorsed candidate, Republican Chere Klein, Ortiz emerged victorious by a narrow margin of just 104 votes.

As a legislator, Ortiz has been active and committed to securing a bright future for every Alaskan. He has sponsored several bills and has been a strong advocate for education funding. He has also worked tirelessly to protect the Alaska Marine Highway and Higher Education Investment funds from the annual Constitutional Budget Reserve sweep.

In addition to his legislative duties, Ortiz maintains a close relationship with his constituents. He regularly updates them about the Public Testimony opportunities and encourages them to voice their opinions. He believes in working hard for his constituents and is always ready to hear from them.

Ortiz's dedication to his work, his commitment to his constituents, and his passion for education make him a respected figure in Alaska's political landscape.
