Mia Costello is a prominent Republican politician from Alaska, currently serving as the Minority Leader of the Alaska House of Representatives. Born on January 11, 1968, in Anchorage, Alaska, she has dedicated her career to public service and has held various significant positions in the state's political landscape.

Costello's educational journey began at West High School in Anchorage, where she graduated in 1986. She then pursued higher education at Harvard University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government in 1990. Her passion for education led her to further her studies at the University of Alaska Southeast, where she obtained a Master of Arts in Teaching in 1997.

Before entering politics, Costello worked in various roles that showcased her commitment to public service and education. She served as a school teacher at Service High School and Juneau-Douglas High School, and also worked as an instructor for Nine Star Education and Employment Services. Additionally, she held positions as a legislative aide and deputy communications director for Governor Frank Murkowski.

Costello's political career began in earnest when she was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 2010, representing the 20th District. She defeated the Democratic incumbent, Bob Buch, in a closely contested race. During her tenure in the House, she served on the House Finance Committee and chaired the Natural Resources Finance Subcommittee. Her dedication to her constituents and her ability to navigate complex legislative issues earned her a reputation as a hardworking and effective legislator.

In 2014, Costello decided to run for the Alaska State Senate, seeking to fill the seat vacated by Democrat Hollis French. She won the election and served as a member of the Alaska Senate from District K from 2015 to 2023. During her time in the Senate, she held several key positions, including Majority Leader in 2019. Her leadership and legislative skills were instrumental in advancing the Republican agenda in the state.

In the 2024 Alaska House of Representatives election, Costello returned to the House, this time representing District 15. She assumed office on January 21, 2025, and quickly rose to the position of Minority Leader. Her extensive experience in both the House and Senate, combined with her deep understanding of Alaska's political landscape, has made her a formidable leader and advocate for her constituents.

She has introduced and supported legislation aimed at making Alaska a more attractive place to live, work, and raise a family. Her efforts to improve the state's energy infrastructure, enhance public safety, and promote economic growth have earned her the respect and admiration of her colleagues and constituents alike.

In addition to her political career, Costello is an active member of several service organizations, including the Alaska Outdoor Council, the National Rifle Association, and the Alaska Airmen's Association. She is also a lifetime member of the Girl Scouts of America. Her dedication to community service and her commitment to improving the lives of Alaskans have been a constant throughout her career.

Mia Costello's journey from a dedicated educator to a prominent political leader is a testament to her unwavering commitment to public service and her passion for making a positive impact on her community.
