Jesse Kiehl represents Juneau, Haines, Skagway, Gustavus, and Klukwan. Born and raised in Anchorage, Jesse graduated from Whitman College at the end of the 1990's after an internship with US Sen. Ted Stevens in Washington, DC. But it was his internship for Gov. Tony Knowles that brought him to Juneau - that's when he knew he'd found home. Jesse worked as a legislative staffer for Southeast state senators for eighteen years, working on behalf of all of the communities in Northern Southeast. He served more than seven years on the Juneau Assembly, including as chair of the finance committee. He brings his experience balancing the city budget and his work supporting public safety and education to his new role as state senator, along with statewide connections from his work on the board of the Alaska Municipal League. Jesse and his wife are raising two daughters in the capital city.
