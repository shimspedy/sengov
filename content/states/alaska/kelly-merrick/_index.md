Kelly Merrick, born in 1975 in Juneau, Alaska, is a dedicated and lifelong Alaskan serving her third term in the Legislature. She is a member of the Republican Party.

Education:
Merrick graduated from Juneau-Douglas High School and later earned a degree in business from Gonzaga University.

Career:
Before her political career, Merrick worked as a legislative aide for Congressman Don Young (R-Alaska) and managed the Alaska Blue Devils and Alaska Blades competitive hockey teams.

Political Career:
Merrick's political journey began when she ran for election to the Alaska House to succeed Lora Reinbold, who ran for the Alaska Senate. Merrick emerged victorious in a 3-way race of the Republican primary and nonpartisan Joe Hackenmueller in the general election. She represented District 14 in the Alaska House of Representatives from 2019 to 2023.

However, her tenure in the House was not without controversy. In 2021, Merrick was censured by Republican District 14 for caucusing with the Democrats. The Alaska Republican State Central Committee also voted to censure Merrick and no longer recognizes Merrick as a Republican.

In 2022, Merrick was elected to the Alaska State Senate representing District L. She was succeeded in the Alaska House by Independent Alyse Galvin. She assumed office as State Senator on January 17, 2023.

Committee Assignments:
Merrick has been assigned to several committees throughout her political career. In her current term (2023-2024), she sits on the Senate Finance, Labor & Commerce, and State Affairs Committees, along with the Joint Armed Services Committee. Her interests lie in natural resource development, public safety, fiscal responsibility, and government transparency.
