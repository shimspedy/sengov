Sarah Vance is an American politician from Alaska. She is a member of the Republican Party and represents the 6th district in the Alaska House of Representatives. She assumed office on January 16, 2019.

Sarah Vance was born on August 18th, 1979 in Texas. She is married to Jeff Vance and they reside in Homer, Alaska. She is an alumnus of Kenai Peninsula College (KPC).

Before her political career, Sarah Vance was a small business owner. She began her political journey as Co-Chair and spokesperson for Heartbeat of Homer, a local recall campaign against three members of the Homer City Council in Homer, Alaska. The group campaigned to recall 3 members of the Homer City Council over transparency complaints. The group accused the city council members Donna Aderhold, David Lewis, and Catriona Reynolds of lying to the public about the intention behind an "inclusivity resolution", which the group alleges was an attempt to declare Homer a sanctuary city. All three council members retained their seats by wide margins.

In 2017, Vance ran for the Homer City Council, finishing third. She defeated incumbent Representative Paul Seaton in the 2018 general election. Vance announced she was running for re-election on November 3, 2020. Running against Vance as an undeclared candidate was Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly President Kelly Cooper. Vance won the reelection.

As of 2023, Sarah Vance is serving her tenure in the Alaska House of Representatives District 6. Her term ends in 2025. She has served in various committees including the House Judiciary Committee, House Transportation Committee, Legislative Budget and Audit Committee, and Victims Advocate Selection Committee.
