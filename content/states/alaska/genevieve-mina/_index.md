Genevieve Mina is an American politician serving as a member of the Alaska House of Representatives for the 19th district. She was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 17, 2023.

Mina was born and raised in Alaska, the daughter of immigrants from the Philippines. She was raised by her mother, an Ilonggo nurse, and her father, an Ilocano grape farmer and Alaskero who fell in love with the state. She studied political science and biology at the University of Alaska Anchorage.

Despite being elected at 26, Mina never thought she’d go into politics. She says she was shy and quiet as a kid, but she wanted to break out of her shell. At East High School, she began volunteering with school groups and realized her love for serving her community.

While studying at the University of Alaska Anchorage, she was introduced to the debate team by a friend. It was a welcome break from her biology degree that quickly transformed into a passion that redirected her future plans. Then, the same friend who introduced her to the debate team asked Mina to help out on her first political campaign.

Mina joined the Alaska Young Democrats and College Democrats, and was elected to be a delegate to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. She’s worked on numerous campaigns, interned in state and municipal political offices, and with policy firms in Alaska and Washington D.C. Her involvement in community groups expanded her interests in health care, public transit, economic empowerment and women’s rights.

Mina grew up in a health care family, where she watched her loved ones care for others as a career. Her mother, a nurse from Iloilo City in the Visayas region, was the first in her family to go to college. All of her immediate family works in the healthcare industry.

Mina represents House District 19 in Anchorage, which covers the Airport Heights, Mountain View and Russian Jack neighborhoods. Like Buchholdt, who represented Spenard for 8 years, Mina has a strong connection to the Anchorage community. It’s where she was raised by her mother, an Ilonggo nurse, and her father, an Ilocano grape farmer and Alaskero who fell in love with the state.
