Bill P. Wielechowski, born on December 7, 1967, is an American lawyer and a Democratic member of the Alaska Senate. He represents District K, which is located in Northeast Anchorage, Alaska. Prior to the 2022 redistricting process, he represented District H from 2013 to 2023. Even before that, he represented District J from 2007 to 2013.

Wielechowski was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey, to a Polish-American family. His grandfather immigrated from Kraków in 1910. He attended Seton Hall University, earning a Bachelor of Science in business management and finance, graduating magna cum laude. He then attended Seton Hall University School of Law, earning his juris doctor in 1992.

After moving to Anchorage, he became a volunteer with the Northeast Community Council, as a Commissioner on the Anchorage Planning & Zoning Commission, and as chair of the Creekside Town Center. In 1999, he was the designated chair of the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board. In 2003, he served on the mayoral transition team for Mark Begich and went on to serve the city as a member of the 2003 Anchorage School District Budget Review Team and the Mayor's Task Force on Obesity and Health. In 2004, he stepped down as designated chair of the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board to become associate general counsel for IBEW Local 1547.

In 2006, he was elected to the Alaska Senate to replace retiring Democratic incumbent Gretchen Guess in District J, which included the neighborhoods of Mt. View, Muldoon, and Russian Jack in Anchorage. In the 2010 election, he defeated Ron Slepecki, winning 58% of the vote to Slepecki's 42%. He was a majority member of the Senate bi-partisan Working Group from 2007 through 2012. He then joined the Minority Caucus. In 2013–2014, Senator Wielechowski led an effort to repeal legislation, passed by the legislature in 2013, granting additional tax credits to oil and gas companies. The effort to repeal the legislation was rejected by Alaska voters in 2014.
