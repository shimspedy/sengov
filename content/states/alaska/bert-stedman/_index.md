Senator Stedman is known for his expertise on energy, taxation, public finance, and state budgeting issues. He served as Co-Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee from 2007 – 2012. During his initial time as Co-Chair, billions of dollars were deposited into state savings accounts such as the Constitutional Budget Reserve and the Earnings Reserve Account of the Alaska Permanent Fund. Protecting the Permanent Fund for future generations of Alaskans to share the state’s oil wealth is his main priority. In 2019, Senator Stedman was again selected by his fellow legislators to serve as Co-Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
