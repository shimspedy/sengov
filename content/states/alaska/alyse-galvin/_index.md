Alyse Surratt Galvin, born on July 18, 1965, is an American businesswoman, education advocate, and politician from the state of Alaska. She was an independent candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Alaska's at-large congressional district in 2018 and 2020, running with the endorsement of the Alaska Democratic Party.

Galvin was born in Riverside, California and raised in Alaska. She graduated from The Bishop's School in La Jolla, California, and earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of California, San Diego. After her education, Galvin worked as a manager at the Anchorage Sheraton.

She is an education advocate and was a part of Bill Walker's transition team in 2014 after his election as governor of Alaska. She co-founded Great Alaska Schools, an advocacy group for education funding.

In January 2018, Galvin announced her candidacy for Alaska's at-large congressional district in the 2018 United States House of Representatives election in Alaska as an independent. She ran in the Democratic primary, receiving 54.1% of the vote, beating out three other contenders. However, she lost to incumbent Republican Don Young in the general election.

Galvin announced that she would run again in the 2020 United States House of Representatives election in Alaska. She calls Alaska "ground zero for the climate crisis" and supports investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency; she opposes the Pebble Mine. However, she agreed with her opponent Don Young on other resource issues, including Arctic oil drilling.

In late 2021, Galvin announced that she would run for the Alaska Legislature. She chose to run for Alaska's 14th House of Representatives district against Republican candidate Nicholas Danger. She assumed office on January 17, 2023, representing the 14th district in the Alaska House of Representatives.

Galvin is married to Pat, an oil executive who served as the revenue commissioner for Governor Sarah Palin. They have three sons and a daughter.
