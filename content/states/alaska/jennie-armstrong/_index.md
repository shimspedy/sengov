Jennie lives in Turnagain where she is raising her family with her husband. She has dedicated her life and career to serving her community and advocating for the most vulnerable.

While earning her BA in Communications from Louisiana State University, she was an activist and leader and received the university’s highest awards for service. She went on to earn an MA in Public Policy and International Law from the American University of Paris and a certificate in International Human Rights Law from Oxford University.

Following graduation, Jennie spent her career supporting Fortune 500 companies, NGOs, and startups on strategy and communications. After several years of working, living, and traveling across four continents and over 30 counties, she founded her consulting company in 2016. She works with her team to launch social good initiatives that can have a lasting impact and support female founders in philanthropy.

She grew up in a working-class family that valued education and taking care of your neighbors above all else. Her parents are lifelong volunteers who modeled the importance of hard work and taught her that what you have doesn’t limit what you are able to give.

Jennie loves to walk and ski on the Coastal Trail, try new restaurants, and go on adventures with her family in Alaska’s great outdoors.
