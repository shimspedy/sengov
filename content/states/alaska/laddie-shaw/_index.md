Laddie Shaw, born Ladislau Henry Shaw on April 8, 1949, in Landshut, Germany, is an American politician. He is a member of the Republican Party and currently represents the 9th district in the Alaska House of Representatives.

Shaw graduated from high school in Flint, Michigan. He then received orders to Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S) at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. After six months of rigorous training, Shaw graduated from BUD/S class 53 in November 1969. He served two tours in South Vietnam with Underwater Demolition Team Thirteen (UDT-13) and SEAL Team ONE. He later served in the Naval Reserve and the Alaska Army National Guard.

In terms of education, Shaw holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from San Diego State University and a Master of Public Administration degree from the University of Alaska Southeast.

Shaw's political career began in 2018 when he ran for election to represent the 26th district in the Alaska House of Representatives. He won a three-way Republican primary with 44.9% of the vote and went on to win the general election with 62.3% of the vote. Shaw has served on several House committees, including Military & Veterans' Affairs, University Of Alaska, Administration, Judiciary, Law, State Affairs, and Joint Armed Services.

In August 2019, following the death of Senator Chris Birch, Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy picked Shaw to fill the District M seat in the Alaska State Senate. However, the Governor's choice required the approval of the Senate, and Shaw was rejected. According to Shaw, he was blocked due to his stance on the amount of the Permanent Fund Dividend: Shaw supports a $3,000 dividend, while some Senate Republicans favor withdrawing less from the fund.

Despite the setback, Shaw continues to serve in the Alaska House of Representatives, representing the 9th district since 2023.
