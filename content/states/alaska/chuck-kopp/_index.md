Charles M. "Chuck" Kopp, born in 1964 or 1965, is a retired police officer and a dedicated public servant who has made significant contributions to the state of Alaska. Raised in Iliamna, Alaska, Kopp's parents were educators and entrepreneurs, instilling in him a strong sense of community and service from an early age. He attended high school at Cook Inlet Academy in Kalifornsky, Alaska, and later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alaska Anchorage. He also pursued graduate coursework in Public Administration at the University of Alaska Southeast.

Kopp's career in public safety spanned over two decades, during which he served as an officer in the Anchorage Police Department and the Kenai Police Department. He became a certified polygraph examiner and successfully resolved several high-profile cases, including three homicides on the Kenai Peninsula where the victims' bodies were never recovered. For seven years, Kopp served as the Chief of Police of Kenai, Alaska, and also took on the role of acting city manager from 2005 to 2006.

In addition to his law enforcement career, Kopp served as an advisor to Governors Sarah Palin and Frank Murkowski, and as the chief of staff for two members of the Alaska Senate. He was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 2016, representing the 24th district from 2017 to 2021. During his tenure, Kopp was affiliated with the Republican Coalition, a bipartisan group of Democratic, Republican, and Independent politicians. He has written opinion columns for various Alaskan newspapers, including the Anchorage Daily News, Juneau Empire, and Peninsula Clarion.

In the 2024 Alaska House of Representatives election, Kopp successfully ran for office again, this time representing the 10th district. He assumed office in January 2025 and continues to serve as a dedicated representative for his community. Throughout his career, Kopp has been driven by a commitment to strengthening Alaska's public safety, education, and transportation workforce, promoting responsible resource development, and securing reliable energy for the state.

Kopp's dedication to public service extends beyond his professional career. He has been actively involved in his community, coaching high school wrestling, serving on various boards, and co-chairing security for the 2006 Arctic Winter Games committee. He has been recognized for his contributions, being named one of Alaska's "Top 40 under 40" and inducted into the Alaska High School Hall of Fame for his outstanding performance as a multisport athlete.

Chuck Kopp and his wife Trish have been married for 37 years and have three children and three grandchildren. They continue to reside in Alaska, where Kopp remains committed to serving his community and making a positive impact on the lives of Alaskans.
