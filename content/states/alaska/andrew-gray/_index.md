Andrew Gray, a dedicated public servant and healthcare professional, was elected the Alaska State House of Representatives in 2022 representing Anchorage's UMED District. Gray is a member of several key committees, including the Judiciary, Ways & Means, and Military & Veteransâ€™ Affairs.

During his first session in Juneau, Gray was dedicated to working on issues concerning housing and homelessness, a testament to his commitment towards addressing complex societal issues. A notable achievement of his early tenure was successfully championing Senate Bill 119 in the House. This crucial legislation mandates the Department of Corrections to provide all individuals released from incarceration with valid photo identification, a measure that received unanimous approval from both chambers.

In addition to his legislative responsibilities, Gray also co-chairs the Freshmen Caucus alongside Representative Justin Ruffridge from Soldotna, fostering unity and collaboration among new lawmakers.

Beyond the walls of the Capitol, Gray serves the community in multiple capacities. As a Physician Assistant at Alaska Urgent Care and a serviceman in the Alaska Army National Guard, he carries his dedication to public service into his professional life. Notably, his commitment to duty was evident when he was deployed to Kosovo with the National Guard in 2019.

Gray engages with his community and shares diverse perspectives through his two podcasts: the "East Anchorage Book Club" and "East Anchorage Matters." These platforms offer insightful interviews with influential Alaskans from the political sphere.

Andrew, his husband Jay, and their 9-year-old son Waylon are long-standing members of the Alaska Unitarian Universalist Fellowship (AUUF), having joined in 2017. This multifaceted life of service demonstrates Gray's deep-rooted commitment to his district and to Alaska at large.
