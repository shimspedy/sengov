Nellie Darlene Jimmie, also known by her Yup'ik name Unangik, is a dedicated American politician and community leader serving as a member of the Alaska House of Representatives for District 38. Born in 1979 in Bethel, Alaska, Nellie is of Yup'ik, Ojibwa, and Lakota descent. Her upbringing was deeply rooted in the subsistence lifestyle of her community, involving activities such as fishing, hunting, and gathering. Her parents, Alexie and Aleta Jimmie, instilled in her traditional knowledge and cultural practices that have shaped her life and career.

Nellie spent her early years in Bethel before moving to Toksook Bay in 1987. She graduated from Nelson Island High School in 1996 and later attended the Alaska Job Corps Center, completing a program in 2000. She also completed some college coursework at the University of Phoenix in 2009. Her educational journey reflects her commitment to continuous learning and personal development.

Before entering politics, Nellie served as the Alaska Village Electric Cooperative (AVEC) board representative for Toksook Bay. She also worked with her family in operating Bayview General Merchandise Inc., a local business that provided essential goods to the community. Her professional background in business and community service laid a strong foundation for her political career.

In the 2024 Alaska House of Representatives election, Nellie ran to represent District 38. Her campaign emphasized addressing housing shortages, improving water and sewer infrastructure, and managing subsistence resources. She advocated for enhanced support and training for village public safety officers and highlighted the need for public health services in rural areas, such as having medical examiners available closer to remote communities. Her legislative priorities also included preserving traditional ways of life, addressing climate change impacts such as erosion and flooding, and fostering cooperation with tribal governments.

Nellie's campaign faced significant challenges, including being outraised by her opponents. Despite these obstacles, she secured 44 percent of the vote in the primary election and won the general election with 51.04 percent of the vote after the ranked-choice voting process, narrowly defeating the incumbent, Conrad McCormick, by 58 votes. Her victory was a testament to her dedication and the support of her community.

Nellie resides in Toksook Bay, Alaska, where she has lived since 1987. She is the mother of two daughters and has been an active member of the Nunakauyak Dance Group since 2012, participating in traditional Yup'ik dances. Her hobbies include sewing, crafting, and subsistence activities, reflecting her deep connection to her cultural heritage and community.

Nellie Jimmie's journey from a subsistence lifestyle in rural Alaska to the halls of the Alaska House of Representatives is a remarkable story of resilience, dedication, and community service. Her work continues to inspire and make a positive impact on the lives of her constituents.
