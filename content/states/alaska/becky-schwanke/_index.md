As a lifelong Alaskan, I am committed to ensuring a better future for the next generation. My background is in natural resource management as well as small business development. I have a strong interest in place-based education, creative workforce development, and sustainable natural resource management. Maintenance of our Alaskan outdoor heritage, while responsibly developing our State's resources is critical to our collective future.
