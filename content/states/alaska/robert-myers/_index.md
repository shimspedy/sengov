Robert Myers Jr., born on August 15, 1983, is an American politician serving as a member of the Alaska Senate for the B district. This district includes North Pole and other parts of the Fairbanks North Star Borough.

Born in Fairbanks, Alaska, Myers spent much of his young childhood at the Salchaket Roadhouse, which his parents owned. He developed a passion for Alaska from a young age. He attended West Valley High School in Fairbanks and later went on to study at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. There, he pursued philosophy, political science, and history, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 2007.

Before embarking on his political career, Myers worked as an intern in the Alaska Legislature. He also spent time as a truck driver and tour bus operator, sharing his love for Alaska with countless people. During college, he drove for a tour company, and he currently drives a truck and frequently travels the Haul Road.

In 2020, Myers ran for state senate and defeated longtime incumbent John Coghill by 14 votes in the Republican primary election. He then went on to defeat independents Marna Sanford and Evan Eads in the general election. Myers describes himself as a conservative Republican.

On the personal front, Myers is married to Dawna Myers, and they are proud parents of five children. When not working, Myers enjoys reading, history, board games, and spending quality time with his wife and children. He ran for office because he wants an Alaska his children will choose to make their home down the road.
