Justin Ruffridge is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Alaska House of Representatives, representing District 7. He assumed office on January 17, 2023, and his current term ends on January 21, 2025.

Born and raised in the Kenai/Soldotna area, Justin moved there with his family in 1994 when his parents, both educators, took up teaching positions at a small Christian school. After graduating from high school in 2001, he attended Washington State University, where he earned a Doctor of Pharmacy degree in 2008.

In 2004, Justin married his wife Jessie. After graduation, they moved back to the Kenai Peninsula to care for Jessieâ€™s terminally ill mother. Justin began his pharmacy career at Soldotna Professional Pharmacy, and several years later, he acquired the Soldotna Pharmacy and the Juneau Drug Company in downtown Juneau with a business partner. They also opened the Alpine Apothecary pharmacy in Girdwood.

Justin has been active in community service, including a brief tenure on the Soldotna Planning and Zoning commission. He was appointed to the Soldotna City Council in 2019 and elected to a full term that October. He also served as the Chair of the Alaska Board of Pharmacy, which creates and enforces regulations for the safe dispensing of medications across the State.

In the summer months, Justin enjoys coaching Little League. He has been an advocate for those in our communities struggling to find housing. During the COVID pandemic, he worked diligently in local communities focusing on prevention, mitigation, and treatment efforts.

Justin believes strongly in classical conservative values, represented by a simple truth that effective change is best accomplished over time resulting from constructive dialogue with all parties involved in the decision-making process. This is fundamentally hard work, but it is worth the effort. Creating lasting and meaningful change requires a desire to be humble, an ability to bring people together, and a willingness to learn.

Justin Ruffridge was elected in 2022 as the District 7 Representative for the Alaska State House, and he is honored to serve the constituents in Kenai and Soldotna.
