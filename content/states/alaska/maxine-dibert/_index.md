Representative Maxine Dibert, is a Koyukon Athabascan who was born and raised in Fairbanks. Her native name is Neelthdinlo which means “a strong runner.” Her grandparents were the late James and Cecelia Johnson from Kokrines, Alaska, and Einar and Katherine Anderson from Sweden and Rampart respectively. Her parents are James Johnson from Kokrines and Clara Anderson from Rampart. She has two adult children, her son Christopher and her daughter Chey. She is currently the only Alaska Native woman serving in the Alaska Legislature.

Representative Dibert taught school in Fairbanks at Denali Elementary for 21 years. Maxine has an undergraduate degree in elementary education from UAF and she also earned a Masters degree in Curriculum Development from Lesley University. She is a contributing member of Women in Science Alaska. Representative Dibert continues to be involved in designing science curriculum that braids indigenous knowledge with western science and education. Maxine has a great passion for learning and she is eager to instill the power and excitement of life-long learning in others.

Representative Dibert’s legislative priorities include: supporting reasonable, inflation-adjusted, increases in education funding (pre-k, k12, university, vocational training, and workforce development programs); working to lower costs for Fairbanks families including childcare, housing, healthcare, and energy costs; and, increasing the number of high paying jobs with good benefits available to the people of Fairbanks, especially young adults. When Maxine has a moment outside of her work representing the people of Fairbanks, she enjoys running, skiing, hiking, gardening, and being active, especially in the outdoors.
