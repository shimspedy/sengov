Throughout his lifetime, Senator Click Bishop has been motivated by a strong desire to help build Alaskan communities through hard work, straight talk, and common sense.

Click was born July 25, 1957 in Mexico, Missouri, and came to Alaska with his family when he was two years old. He lived in a dozen small towns all across the state, until settling in Fairbanks long enough to graduate from Lathrop High School in 1974. Upon entering the workforce, Click joined the Operating Engineers Local 302 and went to work on the construction of the Trans Alaska Pipeline, and later on a myriad of civil, heavy and highway projects across the state.

His focus throughout his career has been on creating jobs, workforce development, and working with companies and businesses to hire skilled Alaskan employees.

To that end, Click served as administrator and coordinator for the Alaska Operating Engineers/Employers Training Trust from 1991-2006, where he oversaw the training programs needed to support a skilled workforce. After that, he was appointed Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. He served as commissioner for 5-1/2 years under Governors Sarah Palin and Sean Parnell, until April 2012.

As a nearly life-long Alaskan, Click enjoys many outdoor activities readily available to residents of the Interior, including hunting, fishing, trapping, placer mining, dog mushing, boating and snow machining. He is a voracious reader and student of history, especially Alaska history.

Click and his wife, Darlene, have two daughters and four grandchildren.
