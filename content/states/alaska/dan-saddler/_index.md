Dan Saddler represents Chugiak-Eagle River and Peters Creek in the Alaska State Legislature, and has a long record of successfully advancing public policy on military affairs, natural resources, services for Alaskans with disabilities, and economic development.

Dan enjoyed a successful 10-year career as a journalist, and nearly 20 years in Alaska's legislative and executive branches of government before winning his first election.

In addition to his work in Alaska, he's advocated nationally for responsible development in ANWR and for better vocational opportunities for veterans, as co-chair of NCSL's Military and Veterans Affairs Task Force, and vice chair of NCSLâ€™s Natural Resources and Infrastructure committee.

Saddler's work has earned him the Council of State Governments "Henry Toll Fellowship," the National Guard Association of the U.S. "Patrick Henry Award," the Key Coalition "Golden Key" Award, Hope Community Resources "Outstanding Legislative Support" Award, and the National Federation of Independent Businesses "Defender of Freedom Award."

He is closely involved in his community, as an active member of the Rotary Club and Chugiak-Eagle River Chamber of Commerce, Resource Development Council of Alaska, Commonwealth North, Chugiak Mustangs and Chinooks booster clubs, and many other military, political, outdoors, and aviation-related groups.

Saddler enjoys experiencing Alaska's outdoors, fishing, reading history, and writing and performing mildly satirical political songs on his guitar.
