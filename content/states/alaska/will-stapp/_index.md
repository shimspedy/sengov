Will Stapp is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 32 in the Alaska House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 17, 2023, and his current term is set to end on January 21, 2025. Prior to his political career, Stapp served in the U.S. Army as an Airborne Infantry soldier from 2006 to 2010.

Stapp lives in Fairbanks, Alaska. After his military service, he embarked on a career as an insurance agent specializing in employee benefits. His commitment to service extends beyond his professional life, as evidenced by his membership in several organizations. These include the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the Rotary Club of Fairbanks, Sunrisers, the Fairbanks Rescue Mission, the 509th Parachute Infantry Association, and the Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce.

In the 2022 elections, Stapp ran for election to the Alaska House of Representatives to represent District 32. He emerged victorious in the general election held on November 8, 2022. The election was conducted using ranked-choice voting, and Stapp won in the first round with 51.8% of the total votes.

Stapp's legislative service began in 2023, and he has since been assigned to several committees, including the House Finance Committee. His work in the legislature is complemented by his efforts on the campaign trail, where he maintains an active presence through his official website and social media platforms.

Born in 1987 in Seattle, Washington, Stapp moved to Alaska following his time in the Army, which included two tours in Iraq. Inspired by HBO’s “Band of Brothers” miniseries and the events of 9/11, which he witnessed live on TV, Stapp joined the airborne infantry. The Army eventually brought him to Fort Wainwright, and he chose to stay in Alaska after completing his service.

In summary, Will Stapp's life and career are characterized by a dedication to service, whether it be in the military, in the insurance industry, or in the political arena. As a representative, he continues to serve his constituents and the state of Alaska with the same commitment and passion that have defined his life.
