David S. Wilson, born around 1981, is an American politician from Alaska. A member of the Republican Party, Wilson has been representing District D in the Alaska Senate since 2017. Before his tenure in the Senate, he served as a city councilman in Wasilla.

Wilson's journey to the Senate was not a straightforward one. He was elected to the Senate at the age of 35, narrowly defeating Representative Lynn Gattis in the Republican primary to succeed longtime Senator Charlie Huggins, who was retiring. Interestingly, Wilson was endorsed in his campaign by the conservative Republican Assembly but did not run with the backing of the Alaska Republican Party. Prior to his primary victory, he was an unaffiliated voter and registered with the Republican Party less than a year before the primary.

Upon being sworn in on January 17, 2017, Wilson made history as the first African-American elected to the Senate from Alaska's Matanuska-Susitna Valley. He is the eighth African-American to serve in the Alaska Legislature. Of those eight, he is the third Republican, the second senator, the first Republican senator, and the first to represent an area of Alaska outside of Anchorage or Fairbanks.

Throughout his tenure, Senator Wilson has sponsored successful legislation every year. Some of his legislative accomplishments include:

- SB 46 (2017): "An Act establishing October 25 of each year as African American Soldiers' Contribution to Building the Alaska Highway Day."
- SB 134 (2018): "An Act relating to medical assistance reimbursement for the services of licensed professional counselors; and providing for an effective date."
- SB 55 (2019): "An Act relating to judges of the court of appeals; and providing for an effective date."
- SB 25 (2019): "An Act extending the termination date of the Board of Dental Examiners; and providing for an effective date."
- SB 43 (2019): "An Act extending the termination date of the Board of Barbers and Hairdressers; extending the termination date of the Big Game Commercial Services Board; relating to a person's eligibility to hold a registered guide-outfitter license, master guide-outfitter license, class-A assistant guide license, assistant guide license, or transporter license; and providing for an effective date."
- SB 134 (2020): "An Act relating to medical assistance reimbursement for the services of licensed professional counselors; and providing for an effective date."
- SB 24 (2021): "An Act relating to holding corporate meetings by remote communication; allowing voting by remote communication at corporate meetings; making shareholder lists available electronically; relating to for-profit and nonprofit corporations; relating to business and industrial development corporations; relating to Native corporations; relating to the Alaska Banking Code; and providing for an effective date."

David Wilson lives in Wasilla, Alaska with his spouse, Aleta. He holds degrees in education and psychology, as well as an MBA with a concentration in health service administration. His career experience includes teaching throughout Alaska in rural communities, providing technical assistance to Alaskaâ€™s Community Health Clinics, and working in the behavioral health field for 11 years.
