Michael Durso is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the New York State Assembly from the 9th district. He was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 3, 2020. His district is comprised of parts of both Nassau and Suffolk counties, including South Farmingdale, Massapequa, Massapequa Park, West Babylon, Babylon, West Islip, Brightwaters, and portions of Fire Island and the Great South Bay area.

Durso was born on November 23, 1979, in Nassau County, New York, and raised in the town of Massapequa Park. Growing up, Durso's parents worked multiple jobs to support the family. After graduating from high school, Durso became a sanitation worker. Prior to entering politics, Durso worked as a sanitation supervisor and helped implement environmental policies that increased recycling initiatives. He is a proud member of CSEA Local 881.

Like many other struggling families on Long Island, Michael worked a second job as a Public Safety Officer at Hofstra University in Hempstead, where his duties included helping protect students on campus. He saw firsthand the dangers students face and knows the importance of strong criminal justice laws. Michael also served as a member of the Teamsters Local 553 and served on the bargaining unit during their last contract.

As a State Assemblyman, Michael works across the aisle to protect the STAR program, keep property tax rebate checks, and increase funding for local schools. As a graduate of carpentry from BOCES in Levittown, Michael advocates for additional funding for vocational programs to train our youth and to fill the shortage of skilled labor. Michael always stands shoulder to shoulder with our police, firefighters, doctors, nurses, and frontline workers. As a certified first responder, Michael understands the importance of securing the resources needed to keep our communities safe.

Michael Durso resides in Massapequa Park with his wife, Dana, and their two daughters, Nicole and Taylor. Dana serves as Trustee for the Village of Massapequa Park and PTA President for East Lake Elementary School.
