Charles David Lavine, born on August 14, 1947, is a member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 13th district. This district includes portions of the towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay in Nassau County. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Early Life and Education

Lavine was born in Marinette, Wisconsin. He graduated from Marinette High School in 1965 and received a B.A. degree in English Literature from the University of Wisconsinï¿½Madison in 1969. After moving to New York, he earned a J.D. from New York Law School in June 1972.

Career

From 1972 to 1976, Lavine worked as a staff attorney for the Legal Aid Society of New York. From 1977 to 1995, he served as a partner in the law firm of Grossman, Lavine & Rinaldo in Forest Hills, New York. Since 1996, he has been a sole practitioner specializing in criminal defense work.

In 2000, Nassau County Executive and Glen Cove Mayor Thomas Suozzi appointed Lavine to the Glen Cove Planning Board. In May 2003, Lavine was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Glen Cove City Council, a position to which he was subsequently elected.

In 2004, he successfully ran in the Democratic Party primary election for an Assembly seat against six-term incumbent David S. Sidikman and later that year won the seat at the general election, taking office in 2005.

In 2016, Lavine announced that he would run for Nassau County Executive in 2017, with a focus on weeding out corruption and strengthening government ethics in Nassau. However, in May 2017, Lavine dropped out of the race for Country Executive and endorsed Laura Curran for the position.

In January 2021, Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie appointed Assemblymember Lavine as Chair of the Judiciary Committee. Lavine is also a member of the Committee on Codes, Ethics and Guidance, Rules and Insurance.

Personal Life

Lavine has been a Glen Cove resident since 1980. He and his wife Ronnie have two grown children, Gregory and Andria.
