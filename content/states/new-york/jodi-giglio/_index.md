Jodi Giglio is a dedicated and hardworking member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 2nd district since January 5, 2021. Born on June 2, 1968, in Syosset, New York, she is a proud member of the Republican Party.

Before her political career, Giglio was a successful businesswoman, owning a construction management company. Her first political position was on the town board of Riverhead, New York, where she was elected in 2009 and 2013. Despite a defeat in the general election for supervisor in 2015, she was re-elected in 2017 to a term-limited third and final term as councilwoman.

As a Riverhead councilwoman, Giglio was known for her efforts to relax social distancing restrictions on catering businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. She advocated for venues to open at 50% capacity and hold events such as sweet 16s and weddings.

Upon beginning her term as assemblywoman, Giglio planned to push a COVID-19 pandemic recovery plan, correct bail reform, adopt a farmers' rights act, restore state funding for schools and hospitals, and authorize infrastructure projects. She also aimed to waive penalties and interest for late property taxes during the pandemic, and plan for Long Island's waste management after the expected 2024 closure of the Brookhaven landfill.

Giglio was one of several politicians from the East End of Long Island to speak out against Andrew Cuomo after the allegations that he sexually harassed multiple women. She called for an independent investigation to be set up by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, calling the accusations disturbing and saying that people should feel safe in the workplace.

Currently, Giglio sits on the Committee on Governmental Employees, Committee on Labor, Committee on Environmental Conservation, Committee on People with Disabilities, Committee on Transportation, and Subcommittee on Employment Opportunities for People with Disabilities.

In addition to her political career, Giglio is a proud union member of Local 138 of the International Union of Operating Engineers and successfully ran a state-certified Women-Owned Business Enterprise. She has been honored by Minority Millennials Inc. as a Woman of Distinction and continues to make a positive impact on minorities and youth in her legislative service.
