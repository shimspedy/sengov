Peter K. Oberacker Jr., born on May 13, 1963, is an American businessman and politician. He is a member of the New York State Senate, representing the 51st district. The boundaries of the 51st district changed following the 2020 United States redistricting cycle, and the district now includes portions of Broome, Chenango, Delaware, Otsego, Schoharie, Sullivan, and Ulster counties.

Oberacker was first elected to the state senate in 2020, succeeding the longtime incumbent James Seward, and assumed office in January 2021. Prior to becoming a state senator, he served in different local offices and helped launch the company FormTech Solutions.

Oberacker was born in Merrick, New York. He graduated from SUNY Delhi. After graduating from college, he joined his father, also named Peter Oberacker, in operating Spicey Pete's Meats, a market in Schenevus. Oberacker first entered the political sphere when he was elected to the Maryland Town Board, a position he held for two terms before being elected town supervisor. After two terms as supervisor, Oberacker was elected to serve as an Otsego County legislator.

In 2020, retiring Senator James Seward encouraged Oberacker to run for the senate seat that he occupied at the time. Oberacker eventually won the seat, winning 55.4 percent of the vote. He assumed office in January 2021.

On the political front, Oberacker voted against the bill that legalized recreational marijuana usage in New York. The bill was signed by Governor Cuomo on March 31, 2021. Oberacker's first bill to be approved by the senate was a bill that designated baseball as the official state sport of New York, an idea that was inspired by Cooperstown Elementary School students. The bill passed by a vote of 61-2.

On the personal front, Oberacker has a wife named Shannon, who he calls his "high school sweetheart". He has two children and one granddaughter. He lives in Schenevus, New York and is a member of his local fire department and EMS squad.
