State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, represents New York’s 47th State Senate District on Manhattan’s West Side, running five miles from Christopher Street to West 103rd Street. The 47th Senate District includes the neighborhoods of Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen, and the Upper West Side, in addition to part of Central Park.

Brad has successfully championed progressive reforms on a wide range of issues, including housing, transportation, public education, LGBTQ rights, environment and seniors. He has passed over 200 bills in the Senate, including legislation to allow the survivors to file claims against their abusers through the Child Victims Act and Adult Survivors Act; the Jose Webster Untraceable Firearms Act that banned ghost guns; the Protect Our Courts Act to prohibit ICE in courtrooms; LGBTQ human rights laws such as the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA) and banning so-called “conversion therapy.”

Brad was the lead sponsor of legislation to legalize gestational surrogacy for LGBTQ people and individuals struggling with infertility. He led the fight in the State Senate to ban flavored e-cigarettes in New York State and pass legislation that helped eliminate the toxic chemical PFAS from our drinking water and clothing. Brad has led initiatives to improve traffic safety by requiring the use of backseat seatbelts in taxis, giving New York City more control over its streets, and reducing the speed limit along the West Side Highway.

Brad is a longtime grassroots activist, serving previously as a Democratic District Leader and three-term chair of Manhattan Community Board 2. He is the past president of the Gay and Lesbian Independent Democrats and a former board member of Tenants & Neighbors and Citizen Action.

Brad has deep roots in Manhattan but was raised in rural West Virginia, where he attended public schools through college. Brad graduated from Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar, and Harvard Law School.

Brad and his husband David, a filmmaker, are the parents of two young daughters, Silvia and Lucy. The family are members of Congregation Beit Simchat Torah, the LGBTQ synagogue.
