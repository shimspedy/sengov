Kevin Thomas was elected in 2018 to represent the 6th District in Nassau County, becoming the first Indian-American in New York history to serve in the State Senate. Senator Thomas currently serves as Chairman of the Consumer Protection Committee and Assistant Majority Leader on House Operations. He is a member of the Rules, Finance, Health, Judiciary, Local Government, and Agriculture committees.

Kevin immigrated to the United States at 10 years old.  His parents never forgot nor took for granted the freedom and opportunities the United States gave them and their children. Their experience motivated Kevin to be an active participant in our democracy, and to give back through public service. Prior to his election, Kevin served as an attorney and civic leader who spent his career fighting for families across New York State. As an appointee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to the New York State Advisory Committee, Kevin worked tirelessly to advance civil rights and expand opportunities for all New Yorkers.

As Chairman of the Consumer Protection Committee, Kevin has been the driving force behind several groundbreaking efforts to strengthen consumer protections and safeguards, including the New York Privacy Act, which aims to make New York the national leader in consumer data protection. In the Senate, Kevin has successfully championed legislation to protect consumers’ private information from exploitation, expand economic opportunities for Long Island families, and combat the growing student loan debt crisis.

Kevin’s public service is rooted in his belief that all New Yorkers should have the opportunity to pursue the American dream, further their education, participate in our economy, and shape our democracy. Kevin is honored to fight for these opportunities each and every day in the New York State Senate.

Senator Thomas lives with his wife, Rincy, his daughter Layla, and their beloved family dog, Sirius.
