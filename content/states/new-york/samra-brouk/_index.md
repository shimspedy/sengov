Samra Brouk is an American politician from the state of New York. Born on May 20, 1986, she is a member of the Democratic Party and has been representing the 55th district of the New York State Senate since January 2021. The 55th district is based in Rochester and its eastern suburbs.

Brouk is the daughter of Ethiopian immigrants and was born and raised in Rochester and nearby Pittsford. After completing her early education, she went on to earn her B.A. in Psychology at Williams College.

Following her graduation, Brouk's dedication to public service led her to join the United States Peace Corps. She worked as a health educator in rural Guatemala, contributing significantly to the community there.

Before her election to the Senate, Brouk spent a decade building educational, environmental, and senior services initiatives in her own community and across New York State. She worked for organizations that protect the environment, help seniors age in place, and address education inequities.

In November 2019, Brouk launched her campaign for the 55th district of the New York State Senate, running against the then-incumbent Republican Rich Funke. However, Funke chose to retire rather than seek a fourth term. Brouk faced no opposition in the Democratic primary and won the general election over Republican Christopher Missick, flipping the seat.

As a senator, Brouk serves as the Chair of the Senate Mental Health Committee and is a member of several other committees including the Aging Committee, the Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Committee, the Education Committee, the Elections Committee, the Health Committee, and the Women's Issues Committee.

She is working to revolutionize New York State’s mental health and substance abuse crisis response so that those in need receive compassionate, therapeutic care. In her first term, the Senator passed legislation to create a 9-8-8 substance abuse and mental health crisis lifeline, improve maternal mental health screenings, and maintain diagnostic authority for thousands of mental health practitioners.

Brouk lives in Rochester with her husband, Brian. She continues to be a strong and active Upstate voice in Albany, fighting for the rights and welfare of her constituents.
