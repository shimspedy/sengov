Anthony Howard Palumbo was born on September 14, 1970, in Brookhaven, New York. He is an American Republican Party politician who currently represents the 1st district of the New York State Senate. Before this, he served as a member of the New York State Assembly.

Palumbo attended high school at Patchogue-Medford High School where he excelled as a baseball player, earning an athletic scholarship to Lafayette College. In 1992, Palumbo was named to the All-Patriot League baseball team. He graduated in 1994 with a bachelor's degree in Government and Law from Lafayette College.

After his undergraduate studies, he attended the St. John's University School of Law. Upon his graduation in 1998, he immediately began his career in public service as an assistant district attorney. He was eventually promoted to the position of trial supervisor to the five eastern Suffolk County towns under District Attorney Thomas Spota.

In 2004, he left the District Attorney's office to open a small law practice in Mattituck, New York. Palumbo resides in New Suffolk, New York with his wife Tracy and their two children.

In 2013, in his first political campaign, Palumbo defeated Democrat John McManmon with 57% of the vote for the open 2nd Assembly District seat. In 2014 he ran for re-election against Democratic challenger Thomas Schirilo and won with 63% of the vote. He was re-elected again in 2016 and 2018.

In 2020, after Senator Kenneth P. LaValle announced he would not be running for reelection after 44 years in the New York State Senate, Palumbo entered the race and won against Democratic challenger Laura Ahearn.

During his tenure, Palumbo introduced a bill that would allow the towns of East Hampton, Riverhead, Shelter Island, Southampton, and Southold to establish community housing funds that would help provide financial assistance to first-time home purchasers in the form of a grant or loan. The bill was signed by the governor.
