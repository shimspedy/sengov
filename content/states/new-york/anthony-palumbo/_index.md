Anthony H. Palumbo represents the 1st Senate District, which includes the northern portion of the Town of Brookhaven, and the Towns of Riverhead, Southold, East Hampton, Southampton and Shelter Island. Previously, Senator Palumbo served in the New York State Assembly for several years, first being elected to the 2nd Assembly District in 2013.

Senator Palumbo is known as being an outspoken advocate for Suffolk County taxpayers and a strong proponent of law enforcement and the area’s first responders. As the Ranking Minority Member on the Senate Code's Committee, he has led the fight against the dangerous bail reform laws that have made our communities less safe and has been steadfast in his opposition to the anti-police rhetoric and policies coming out of Albany.   

Throughout his tenure in the State Legislature, Senator Palumbo has worked closely with former State Senator Ken LaValle and Assemblyman Fred Thiele to protect our natural resources and clean drinking water, and is a champion for the region’s tourism, agriculture, fishing and spirits industries.

Prior to serving in the State Legislature, Senator Palumbo worked as a Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney, where he prosecuted major crimes and drug traffickers. He has taken that background to Albany, where he’s fought to keep our communities safe, hold public officials accountable and enhance the quality of life that makes Suffolk County unique.

Senator Palumbo has continued to show the drive and vision families on Long Island need and deserve in state government. His very first piece of legislation was a massive tax-cut bill that would save the average Suffolk County resident over $2,500 annually. That same year, he accomplished a rare feat for a freshman GOP Assemblyman by sponsoring and passing major legislation that helped first-time homebuyers and younger residents save thousands.  In his first term in the New York State Senate, Senator Palumbo passed the Peconic Bay Region Community Housing Act—bi-partisan legislation to help make the dream of homeownership on Long Island more affordable.  

In addition to his proven record as a tax reformer, Anthony hasn’t shied away from tackling the tough quality of life and public safety issues Long Island families face. He was a leader of the movement to reform and repeal Common Core, supported and passed a constitutional amendment stripping corrupt politicians of a taxpayer-funded pension and supported significant investment in improving our water quality and environment.  He has also made education a top priority and is a strong advocate in the battle to ensure Long Island taxpayers receive their fair share of school aid and infrastructure funding.

Currently, the Senator’s top priorities are getting our economy back on track post-pandemic so our small business can thrive, and repealing the controversial bail and discovery reforms harming our residents and local law enforcement. Senator Palumbo will continue to lead and maintain his commitment to defending Suffolk County values and enhancing the quality of life on the East End.  As a lifelong resident of Suffolk County, Senator Palumbo loves our communities and will continue to build on his record of protecting and serving them.

Senator Palumbo attended Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania on a baseball scholarship and earned a degree in Government and Law.  He received his law degree from St. John’s Law School in Jamaica, New York.

Today, Anthony and his wife, Tracy, reside in New Suffolk with their two children.
