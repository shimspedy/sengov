Stacey Pheffer Amato is proud to represent the New York State Assembly's 23rd District, encompassing the Queens neighbourhoods of Ozone Park, Lindenwood, Howard Beach, Hamilton Beach, Broad Channel, Breezy Point, Roxbury, Neponsit, Belle Harbor, Rockaway Park, Rockaway Beach, Arverne, Edgemere, Bayswater and Far Rockaway since 2017.

 Assemblywoman Pheffer Amato has never shied away from stepping up to advocate for causes she feels passionate about. In Albany, she is an outspoken champion for our hardworking families, first responders, Veterans and seniors. She is always fighting to bring additional resources to South Queens and the Rockaway Peninsula. Being recognized for her efforts in the legislature and fighting for public employees, Stacey was appointed Chair of the Governmental Employee Committee, being only the second woman to ever hold this role in New York State history. As Chair she will work to facilitate the best possible legislative policies for public employees that range in pensions, retirement benefits, and health insurance. She also serves as a leading member of the Education, Veterans’ Affairs, Corporations, Authorities & Commissions, and Racing & Wagering Committees. In addition, she is a member of the Legislative Women’s Caucus, the Women’s Issues Task Force and the Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force.

The Assemblywoman is responsible for ground-breaking legislation and for providing funding that has positively impacted her district. She has passed over twenty pieces of legislation, often with bipartisan support. She has focused on helping to improve women’s health, expanding the rights of the disabled and elderly, bringing new resources to veterans and 9/11 first responders, improving the local environment and Jamaica Bay, and raising the profile of drowning and the importance of swim safety. She has also been credited for bringing millions of dollars for STEM education funding, as well as working with the NYPD on public safety.

Assemblywoman Pheffer Amato and her team pride themselves in their commitment to constituent services working under the notion that "people are the most important and government should work for you." Stacey and her office have been recognized and heavily praised for their commitment to helping resolve a variety of issues by cutting the "red tape" and getting answers for the residents of the 23rd Assembly District.

Assemblywoman Pheffer Amato’s mother, Queens County Clerk Audrey I. Pheffer, previously held this Assembly seat for over twenty-five years, and upon the Assemblywoman's election, they became the first mother-daughter team in NYS history to be elected to the State Legislature. Stacey and her husband, Frank, proudly live in Rockaway Beach with their two children, Sam and Isabella along with their cat Sugar.
