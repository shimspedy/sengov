Andrew Joseph Lanza, born on March 12, 1964, is an American lawyer and Republican politician. He was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Great Kills, Staten Island. He graduated from Monsignor Farrell High School in Oakwood in 1982. He attended St. John's University, receiving a B.S. in Accounting. He obtained his Juris Doctor degree from Fordham University School of Law.

Before entering politics, Lanza was Managing Member and General Counsel Partner of Mercury Securities LLC, a Wall Street software development and stock trading firm. Previously, he was an Assistant District Attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and prosecuted street crimes, felony cases, New York State Welfare fraud, and procedural and constitutional issues. Lanza also was a senior auditor with KPMG Peat Marwick, where he audited public and private firms, banks, importers, and hospitals.

Lanza was first elected to the New York City Council as a Republican in 2001. At the time, he was one of three Republicans on the 51-member council. He was re-elected in 2003 and 2005. Lanza lives in Great Kills with his wife, Marcele, a public middle school administrator, and their three children. He is a childhood friend of former U.S. Congressman Vito Fossella of Staten Island.

Lanza was elected to the New York State Senate in 2006, replacing Senator John J. Marchi, who retired after holding the seat for 50 years. Since his initial election, he has won by large margins and been unopposed three times. After Democrats took control of the state senate in the 2018 elections for only the third time since World War II, Lanza was the only Republican representing part of New York City.

On June 21, 2007, Lanza and Assemblyman Michael Cusick announced the enactment of a law establishing the 13th Judicial District, consisting solely of Richmond County and separating Staten Island from Brooklyn’s 2nd Judicial District.
