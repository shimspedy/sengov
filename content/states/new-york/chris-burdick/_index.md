Christopher W. Burdick, born on September 1, 1951, is an American politician and attorney. He is currently serving as a member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 93rd district.

Education and Early Career:
Burdick graduated from the University of California at Berkeley, where he received a B.A. in economics and history. He later obtained a master's degree in international studies from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Finally, Burdick earned a Juris Doctor from Seton Hall Law School, in Newark, New Jersey. Before being elected as Bedford Town Supervisor, Burdick held a senior counsel position at Stewart Title Insurance Company of New York.

Political Career:
Burdick's personal political career first started in 1977 when he ran as a Democratic candidate for New Jersey's 40th State Assembly District, at age 26. Burdick gained the most votes in the Democratic Primary but lost to Republican Party candidates William Cary Edwards and Walter M. D. Kern, Jr in the General election. Burdick had previously been a legislative aid to New Jersey State Assemblymember Andrew Maguire.

Burdick was first elected to public office in 2007, when he won a seat on the Bedford Town Board, running as a Democrat. Burdick was re-elected to his position on the town board in 2011. In 2013, Burdick was elected as the Bedford Town Supervisor.

In 2020, Democratic incumbent Assemblyman David Buchwald announced he would not seek re-election for the 93rd Assembly District, to pursue a bid for the New York's 17th congressional district. Burdick won the Democratic primary for the 93rd Assembly race, and went on to win in the General election, defeating Republican candidate John Nuculovic. Burdick took office as a member of the New York State Assembly on January 1, 2021, leaving his position as Bedford Town Supervisor to Bedford Town Board Member and Deputy Supervisor MaryAnn Carr.

The 93rd Assembly District includes the towns of Bedford, Harrison, Lewisboro, Mount Kisco, New Castle, North Castle, North Salem, Pound Ridge and White Plains.
