James Skoufis and his family moved to the Town of Woodbury from Queens in 1995 for many of the same reasons we all choose to live in the Hudson Valley: a better quality of life, an education that strives for nothing short of excellence, and a strong, friendly, and caring community.

After graduating from Monroe-Woodbury High School, James went on to become the first in his immediate family to attend college. He earned a Bachelor's Degree from The George Washington University and Master's Degree from Columbia University. Along with the fortunate help of scholarships and student loans, he worked his way through college, holding a job every semester.

Having spent the first many years of his life in New York City Public Housing and being only one generation removed from food stamps, James understands what the uncertainty of tomorrow feels like. He knows the experience of living paycheck to paycheck and is committed to creating opportunities that allow everyday New Yorkers to thrive.

During his six years in the State Assembly, James fought for the Hudson Valley's working- and middle-classes. He's been a champion of better schools, stronger infrastructure, leveling the playing field, and fighting corruption. James was first elected to the State Senate in 2018, and soon took over chairmanship of the Investigations and Government Operations Committee, where he continues to deliver results for his Hudson Valley constituents while serving with integrity.

James lives in Cornwall and has a loving daughter, Ava, born in 2021.
