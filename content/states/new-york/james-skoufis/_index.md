James Skoufis, born on October 18, 1987, is an American politician of the Democratic Party. He is currently representing the 42nd District of the New York State Senate since 2023. Prior to this, Skoufis represented the 39th District from 2019 to 2022.

Skoufis began his political career on the Woodbury town board in Orange County. In 2012, he was elected to the New York State Assembly, becoming its youngest member at the age of 25. He was re-elected in 2014 and 2016.

Born in Flushing, Queens in 1987, Skoufis is the son of a Greek immigrant. His family moved north to the town of Woodbury in the Hudson Valley in 1995. He graduated from Monroe-Woodbury High School in 2005. He has a bachelor's degree from The George Washington University and a masters from Columbia University.

Skoufis worked at an electronic security firm and was on the Woodbury Town Board. After redistricting in 2012 following the decennial census, long-time Republican Assemblywoman Nancy Calhoun decided to retire, leaving the seat vacant. Skoufis received the Democratic nomination for the seat, defeating Larry Delarose at the party's county convention. In the November general election, he defeated Republican Goshen Mayor Kyle Roddey with 56% of the vote. At age 24, he became the youngest member of the Assembly.

Skoufis introduced his first two bills within a week of being sworn in; both were inspired by the aftermath of Hurricane Irene in 2011. Both bills passed the Assembly a few months later. Skoufis was an outspoken supporter of increasing the minimum wage. Early in 2014, Skoufis introduced Tuition-Free NY, a proposal to make SUNY and CUNY in New York State tuition-free as long as students fulfill community service and residency requirements.

In 2018, longtime Senator William J. Larkin Jr. retired at age 88. He had served in the seat since 1991. Prior to Larkin's retirement, Skoufis was floated as a potential challenger. After Larkin announced his retirement, Skoufis entered the race. In a good year for Democrats, Skoufis defeated Republican Stony Point Councilman Tom Basile, 54 percent to 46 percent. Democrats also took the majority in the Senate in the same election.

James Skoufis lives in Cornwall and has a loving daughter, Ava, born in 2021.
