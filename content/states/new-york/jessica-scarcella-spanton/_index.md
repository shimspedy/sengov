Jessica Scarcella-Spanton is a dedicated public servant representing New York's 23rd District, which covers the North and East Shores of Staten Island and Southern Brooklyn. She is the Chair of the Veterans, Homeland Security and Military Affairs Committee and also serves as a member of several other committees including Civil Service and Pensions, Cultural Affairs, Tourism, Parks and Recreation, Disabilities, Insurance, Labor, and Women's Issues.

Born and raised on Staten Island, New York, Jessica is the proud daughter of two school teachers. Her journey to public service began in 2009 when she started her career in government as an intern with the New York State Assembly. She was quickly hired as Legislative Director before even completing her Bachelor's degree. One of her proudest moments was when she was awarded by an advocacy group for her legislative efforts to help families that experienced the tragedy of stillbirth. She worked with the group to organize families from each district to speak to their own Assemblymembers and garnered 148 sponsors for the legislation; that bill is now law today.

In 2012, Jessica moved to Colorado Springs, where her now-husband Josh was serving in the United States Army. Their daughter Emily was born just two weeks before he deployed to Afghanistan for the second time. After her husband completed his military service, they returned to New York and now reside in West Brighton with their two children, Emily and Jack.

Jessica went to work for Senator Diane Savino in 2017 as her Director of Operations, where she worked for 4.5 years. Some of her major accomplishments were getting over 1000 families across Staten Island and Brooklyn their vaccines when there were no appointments available and successfully fighting to get an Executive Order passed which would require hospitals to allow women in labor a support person when hospitals prevented this during COVID.

After a brief stint at the MTA as the Assistant Director of Government and Community Relations, Jessica decided to return to the world of politics. Encouraged by Senator Diane Savino, she ran for election to the New York State Senate to represent District 23 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. Since then, she has been serving her constituents with dedication and commitment, striving to make a positive impact in their lives.
