Edward C. Braunstein is an American politician from Bayside, Queens. He was born on April 21, 1981, and is a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly representing the 26th Assembly District in Queens, New York.

Braunstein received a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from the State University of New York at Albany. After college, he worked as a legislative assistant in the New York City office of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, while also attending evening classes at New York Law School. He graduated magna cum laude in February 2009 and subsequently passed the New York State bar exam that same month.

He has served on Queens Community Board 11 and was a member of its Parks Committee and Education Committee. Braunstein won a September 2010 Democratic primary election to replace retiring Assembly member Ann-Margaret Carrozza. In the November 2010 general election, he defeated the Conservative-Republican candidate by a vote of 15,264 to 11,043.

Braunstein was born and raised in Bayside and now resides in Bay Terrace with his wife, Stephanie, and their three children. He was elected to the New York State Assembly in 2010 to represent the 26th District in Northeast Queens, which includes the neighborhoods of Auburndale, Bay Terrace, Bayside, Bayside Hills, Broadway-Flushing, Douglaston, Floral Park, Glen Oaks, Little Neck, New Hyde Park, North Shore Towers, Oakland Gardens, and Whitestone.

Assemblyman Braunstein is the Chair of the Cities Committee and is a member of the committees on Health, Judiciary, Rules, and Ways and Means. He has introduced numerous bills, including legislation to cap the increase in property tax assessments for co-ops and condos; provide tax credits for small businesses that hire senior citizens; prohibit price gouging during emergencies; protect consumer privacy; prevent sex offenders from residing within 1,000 feet of a school; and expand the availability of naloxone to help prevent drug overdose deaths.

In July 2011, Assemblyman Braunstein�s first bill to be signed into law banned so-called �bath salts�. His legislation protecting New Yorkers from fraudulent attorneys by making the unlicensed practice of law a felony was signed into law in December 2012. His legislation requiring campuses to notify local law enforcement of on-campus violent crimes and missing persons was signed into law in December 2014, and his bill establishing the crime of unlawful dissemination or publication of an intimate image, also known as �revenge porn,� was enacted in July 2019.
