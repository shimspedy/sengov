Jeffrey Dinowitz was elected to the New York State Assembly to represent the 81st Assembly District in the Bronx on February 15, 1994. He led a team of reformers that swept into party office in 1986 and built a strong and vibrant party in the 81st A.D. The district includes Riverdale, Kingsbridge, Van Cortlandt Village, Kingsbridge Heights, Marble Hill, Norwood, Woodlawn and Wakefield.

Assemblyman Dinowitz chairs the Assembly Committee on Codes. He also serves on the Rules, Ways and Means, Health and Election Law committees. He previously chaired the Committees on Judiciary, Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, Consumer Affairs and Protection, Aging, and Alcoholism and Drug Abuse. He is an outspoken supporter of addressing historic funding inequities in New York’s public education system by increasing aid to New York City schools, protecting tenants' rights and supporting homeowners, supporting mass transit, and taking substantial climate action to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Assemblyman Dinowitz has authored numerous laws throughout his tenure, including the Anti-Human Trafficking Act (2007), National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (2014), the MTA Lockbox (2018), Non-Medical Vaccine Exemption Repeal (2019), and the COVID-19 Emergency Eviction and Foreclosure Prevention Act (2020/21).

Jeffrey Dinowitz believes elected officials should pay particular attention to neighborhood issues and individual constituent problems. His district office has helped thousands of people cut through government red tape with city, state and federal agencies. Whether it was leading the fight against the multi-billion dollar boondoggle water filtration plant, helping to spearhead the creation of a business improvement district in Kingsbridge or being a major force in the creation of two new middle/high schools in Riverdale and Kingsbridge, Assemblyman Dinowitz has always been outspoken on every issue important to his constituents.

He has represented his community in a number of political capacities. He was elected as a State Committeeman* in 1978 and served as a District Leader from 1986 to 1994. He served as a Delegate to his party’s* National Convention in 1980, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020, Chair of his party’s County Committee in the Bronx from 2008 to 2016, and Secretary of his party's County Committee in the Bronx from 2018 to present.

Born in 1954, Jeffrey Dinowitz has lived in the Bronx all of his life. He is a graduate of Brooklyn Law School, Herbert H. Lehman College of the City University of New York, the Bronx High School of Science and Bronx public schools. He has been married to Sylvia Gottlieb since 1978. They have two children and four grandchildren. Prior to his election to the Assembly he served as an Administrative Law Judge for the State of New York.
