Christopher J. Ryan is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the New York State Senate. He represents the 50th District, which includes parts of Onondaga and Oswego counties. Senator Ryan assumed office on January 1, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 1, 2027.

Senator Ryan's career in public service is marked by a deep commitment to his community and a strong focus on advocacy for workers' rights and economic development. Before joining the State Senate, he served as the Minority Leader in the Onondaga County Legislature, where he was a member since 2011. During his tenure, he chaired the Public Safety Committee, working to enhance operations within the Sheriff's Office, Emergency Management, and the District Attorney's Office. He also served as Vice Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, showcasing his expertise in fiscal matters.

Ryan's journey in public service began even earlier when he was elected to the Geddes Town Board in 2005. There, he served as Deputy Supervisor for two years and chaired the Zoning & Planning Committee, demonstrating his dedication to local governance and community planning.

Beyond his legislative roles, Senator Ryan has a rich history as a trade unionist. He trained with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) to become a lineman and worked for a telephone company. His leadership skills were recognized early, and he was appointed union Shop Steward in 1997. Over the years, he rose through the ranks, serving as Executive Vice President and later as President of CWA Local 1123. In this capacity, he advocated tirelessly for workers' rights, negotiated contracts, and played a pivotal role in attracting and retaining jobs for nearly 800 union workers in Central New York.

Senator Ryan's educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice from Buffalo State College and an Associate of Applied Science in Criminal Justice from Onondaga Community College. He is also an alumnus of Westhill High School, where he laid the foundation for his lifelong commitment to learning and service.

A lifelong resident of Central New York, Christopher Ryan grew up on the west side of Syracuse in the town of Geddes. He currently resides there with his wife, Erin, a dedicated public school teacher. Together, they have four children: Maeve, Aidan, Molly, and Declan. Senator Ryan's personal and professional life reflects his unwavering dedication to his family, his constituents, and the values he holds dear.
