A lifelong Western New York resident, Assemblyman Joseph Giglio has dedicated his professional career to public service.

Giglio is the Chairman of the Assembly Minority Conference’s Committee on Standing Committees, part of the leadership team in Albany. Assemblyman Giglio’s current committee assignments are as follows: Ethics and Guidance (Ranking Minority Member); Correction (Ranking Minority Member); Codes; and Rules.

In addition, the Minority Conference of the New York State Assembly has set up task forces to gather input and ideas that can be used to craft legislation. Assemblyman Giglio’s background in corrections led him to be selected to co-chair the Assembly Minority Task Force on Preventing Domestic Violence, the Assembly Minority Task Force on Heroin Addiction & Community Response, and the Assembly Minority Conference Criminal Justice Reform Study. He was also co-chair of the Assembly Minority Statewide Forum on Workforce Issues in the Correctional System; a member of the Medicaid Waste, Fraud and Abuse Task Force; the Agriculture, Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Task Force; and the Crime in our Communities Task Force. Assemblyman Giglio was the Assembly Minority’s appointment to the Public Authorities Control Board and the Medicaid Redesign Team. The team reviewed the Medicaid program for two years, uncovering approximately $2.5 billion in savings enacted as part of the State budget.

As State Deputy Inspector General, Giglio conducted investigations of alleged criminal activity, fraud, waste and abuse within state agencies, and those private individuals and/or companies that do business with New York in a region stretching from Buffalo to Syracuse to the Pennsylvania border. Giglio’s efforts to root out corruption saved taxpayer dollars and eliminated government waste.

Prior to joining the Inspector General’s Office, Assemblyman Giglio served as a special assistant in the State Attorney General’s office, with responsibility for coordinating efforts with all branches of government. The experience gained through these positions has helped the assemblyman to be an effective advocate for our Southern Tier communities.

Assemblyman Joseph Giglio brings a wealth of law-enforcement experience gained by serving in the sheriff’s departments of Cattaraugus and Erie counties. He knows what it takes to defend our community and understands what our law enforcement agencies need to successfully fight crime. As a former small-business owner, Giglio also understands the challenges our job creators face.

Assemblyman Giglio has been recognized by the New York State Farm Bureau as a member of its “Circle of Friends” group for having a perfect voting record in support of agricultural issues. He received the Community Partners Award from the Cattaraugus County Council on Alcoholism & Substance Abuse as well as the Friends of Families Award from the Cattaraugus County Mental Health Association.

The decennial redistricting process created the new 148th Assembly District that Assemblyman Giglio now represents. The district includes all of Cattaraugus and Allegany counties, and six towns in Steuben County. The district has 67 towns, 19 villages, two cities, all or parts of three territories of the Seneca Nation of Indians, and numerous school districts, fire departments, libraries and community organizations.

Joseph Giglio earned a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from the State University of New York at Buffalo.

Joe and his wife, Ann, live in Gowanda, Cattaraugus County, and have four grown children and two grandchildren.
