Luis R. Seplveda is an American attorney and politician who currently serves as the New York State Senator from the 32nd Senate District, which includes parts of the Bronx. He was first elected to represent the 32nd Senate District in April 2018. His diverse district covers central areas of the Bronx. He previously served for three terms as the Assemblyman for the 87th Assembly District.

A staunch advocate for his constituents and the people of the state of New York, Senator Sepulveda has been a champion of bolstering economic opportunity, diversity, and social service reforms, especially as they affect middle and working class families. As Senator, he has been a leader in criminal justice reform, working to change the culture of distrust between communities of color and the police, and to correct inherent racial biases in the justice system.

During the 2019 Legislative Session, he oversaw the historic criminal justice reforms in ending cash bail, early discovery, and speedy trial. He continues to lead on legislation supporting rehabilitation and reentry, ending solitary confinement, creating civilian oversight of the state correctional system, and more. His efforts as Assemblymember included sponsoring a bill to create a board to review civilian deaths and near-deaths involving police officers, a bill requiring videotaping of all engagements between uniformed officers and individuals in the community, and advocating for Raise the Age legislation to prevent 16- and 17-year-olds from being charged as adults.

Senator Seplveda has become a recognized leader in Albany as an advocate for immigrant rights in New York, as the lead sponsor of two of the states most impactful and historic immigration bills: the NY State Jose Peralta DREAM Act and the Green Light Bill, which respectively expanded access to higher education and drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants.

Senator Seplveda has continuously advocated for increased funding for community health and mental health services. His efforts to raise the visibility among legislators and key opinion leaders of the alarming suicide rate in the Latina teen population proved fruitful most recently when Governor Cuomo announced the formation of the New York State Suicide Prevention Task Force. The Senator also worked closely with Mayor de Blasio in 2014 to secure funding for universal pre-kindergarten in New York City.

Senator Seplveda earned his bachelors from Hofstra University and his law degree from Hofstras Maurice A. Deane School of Law. He is one of two Latinx attorneys in the New York State Legislature. In 2022 Senator Luis Sepulveda became the first New York State Senator to be granted Dominican Citizenship.
