Steven H. Stern, born on October 30, 1968, is a dedicated public servant and a member of the New York State Assembly representing the 10th district. This district includes portions of the towns of Babylon and Huntington in Suffolk County. A Democrat, Stern was first elected in 2018 through a special election.

Stern hails from Holbrook, New York. He pursued his higher education at Tulane University and later received his law degree from Western Michigan University. After his studies, he became a partner at Davidow and Davidow in Islandia, New York, where he focused on elder law.

In 2005, Stern ran for the Suffolk County Legislature and was reelected five times, serving until 2018. When Congressman Steve Israel retired in 2016, Stern ran in the open Democratic primary to represent New York's 3rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, but lost the primary election.

In 2018, Stern was recruited to run and won a special election to succeed Chad Lupinacci in the New York State Assembly, becoming the first Democrat to win the district in 40 years. He was re-elected in the 2018 general election with 59.9% of the vote. He ran for re-election again in the 2020 general election and was re-elected to his second full term with 56.4% of the vote. He was again re-elected in 2022.

Stern sits on the Aging, Banks, Economic Development, Job Creation, Commerce and Industry, Energy, Insurance, and Veterans' Affairs committees. He currently resides in Dix Hills, New York.

Throughout his career, Stern has been a strong advocate for public safety, environmental protection, and veterans' affairs. He co-sponsored New York�s �Red Flag Law� which helps keep guns out of the hands of those who should not have them and allows immediate intervention when individuals demonstrate dangerous or violent behavior that poses a risk to public safety.

With our Long Island environment facing unprecedented threats, Steve is working to protect the air we breathe, the water we drink and our environment from the dangers of a rapidly changing climate. In just his first legislative session, Assemblyman Stern co-sponsored and passed initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and incentivize renewable and sustainable energy; prohibit offshore drilling in our Long Island coastal waters; ban products that contain 1,4 dioxane that contaminate our sole-source aquifer; and secured vital funding for clean water infrastructure to protect our water quality.

Stern has also authored several legislative initiatives that have been the first in New York State and even in the nation. He introduced and passed the Housing Our Homeless Heroes Act, an important legislative initiative to end veteran homelessness and ensure that our veterans and their families always have a place to call home. He also created New York State�s first Silver Alert system, which � like an Amber Alert � assists in the safe return of our loved ones with Alzheimer�s and other cognitive disorders.
