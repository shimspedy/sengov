Latrice Monique Walker is the Assembly member for the 55th District of the New York State Assembly. She is a Democrat. The district includes portions of Brownsville in Brooklyn.

Walker was born and raised in Brownsville, Brooklyn in Prospect Plaza Houses, a NYCHA development. She attended New York City Public Schools, including Brooklyn Technical High School, prior to receiving her bachelor's degree at SUNY Purchase College, and her J.D. from Pace University.

Prior to her election to the Assembly, Walker served as chief counsel to United States Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, who represents much of the same area in Congress. Currently, she resides in Ocean Hill-Brownsville with her daughter, Nile. Walker is an active member of Zeta Phi Beta sorority.

In 2014, Assemblyman William F. Boyland Jr. was found guilty of corruption and was therefore forced to resign. As a result, the seat became open and Walker as well as six others entered the race. In a seven-way primary, Walker secured the nomination with just under 40% of the vote. She would easily win the general election. Walker was sworn into office on January 1, 2015.

Walker is the chair of the Assembly�s Election Law Committee. And she�s a member of the Housing, Judiciary, Codes and coveted Ways and Means Committees. She is a leading voice on voting rights, criminal justice reform, environmental justice, affordable housing, tenants� rights, and a host of other issues that are important to New Yorkers.

While she has compiled an impressive legislative record, she is probably best known for being the engine behind the 2019 bail reform law which eliminated cash bail for most misdemeanors and non-violent felonies. The intent was to stem mass incarceration and to dismantle the two-tier system of cash bail where people who could afford to pay bail were able to wait for their trials at home. Those who couldn�t afford to pay � the majority of them Black or brown � were jailed pretrial. When recent rollbacks were proposed near the end of the budget process earlier this year, Walker went on a hunger strike for 19 days in protest. Some of the rollbacks were beaten back, while others succeeded. She has vowed to keep fighting. Her display of courage drew praise from Buffalo to Brownsville.

In her beloved 55th District, she is a mentor to young people and is beloved by seniors. She is a familiar face in churches, businesses and in the courtyards of public housing developments that no doubt remind her of the Prospect Plaza Houses where she was raised. When Assemblywoman Walker is not in Albany, she mentors young people, spends time with seniors and is a dedicated mother to her daughter, Nile Anderson. She�s an active member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. She lives in Ocean Hill-Brownsville and belongs to Wayside Baptist Church.
