April N.M. Baskin is a Democratic member of the New York State Senate, representing the 63rd District. She assumed office on January 1, 2025, and her current term is set to end on December 31, 2026.

Senator Baskin has a rich history of public service and leadership. Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, she is deeply connected to the community she represents. A graduate of Buffalo Public Schools and Empire State College, Baskin began her political career in 2017 when she was elected to the Erie County Legislature. She quickly rose to prominence, becoming the youngest legislator and the first freshman to serve as Chairwoman of the Erie County Legislature in 2019.

During her tenure in the Erie County Legislature, Baskin championed policies aimed at addressing racial and economic inequities, improving infrastructure, and empowering small businesses. One of her notable achievements was the creation of the Erie County Urban Initiative Program, which invested over $13 million in historically underserved communities. This initiative brought much-needed resources to neighborhoods in Buffalo, Lackawanna, and Tonawanda, addressing long-standing infrastructure inequities.

As a State Senator, Baskin continues to advocate for systemic reforms and lasting opportunities for her constituents. She has been a tireless advocate for affordable housing, passing Erie County's first-ever Affordable Housing Law and directing funds to emerging developers in Buffalo. Her efforts have ensured that smaller-scale projects led by underrepresented developers receive the support they need to succeed.

Baskin's leadership extends beyond housing and infrastructure. She has been a vocal proponent of economic empowerment, securing significant funding for community development projects. Following the tragic May 14, 2022, terrorist attack in Buffalo, she led efforts to secure $4.5 million for Jefferson Avenue housing and mixed-use developments. This funding revitalized a historic hub of Buffalo's Black economy and laid the foundation for a more equitable future.

Throughout her career, Senator Baskin has demonstrated a commitment to advancing economic equity, affordable housing, and systemic justice for underserved communities. Her dedication to public service and her transformative achievements have made her a respected leader in New York State politics.
