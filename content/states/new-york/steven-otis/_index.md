Since the creation of WIIA, the program has provided almost $1.8 billion in water grants: creating jobs, making environmental projects possible and making these projects more affordable for local taxpayers.

Otis, who serves on the Assembly Education Committee, has been a strong advocate in the Assembly for increased state funding to school districts, especially for increasing Foundation Aid to school districts receiving a low percentage of the aid they are due. 2021 represented a watershed year on the Foundation Aid issue with a record statewide increase and a commitment to full funding by 2023.
