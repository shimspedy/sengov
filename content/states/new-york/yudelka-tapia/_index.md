Early Life and Education

Tapia was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Raised in what she described as "a family of organizers", Tapia described her father as "a revolutionary" who "fought in the civil war against the invasion of the Yankees in 1965." Tapia became involved in social activism at O&M College, where she founded and led the Uni�n Democr�tica de Mujeres as the group's president. She immigrated to the United States at age 19, settling in the West Bronx, and attended Bronx Community College in the 1990s. Tapia later earned a master's degree in urban policy and leadership from Hunter College.

Career

Tapia worked as an auditor for the City of New York for 23 years. She served as a local Democratic district leader and as president of the parent teacher association at Theodore Roosevelt High School. In the 2021 New York City Council election, Tapia unsuccessfully ran to represent the 14th district, losing to Pierina Sanchez. Following assemblyman Victor Pichardo 's resignation announcement, Tapia announced her candidacy to replace him. Tapia was nominated as the candidate of the Democratic Party and won the special election to succeed Pichardo. Tapia has endorsed Kathy Hochul 's campaign in the 2022 gubernatorial election.
