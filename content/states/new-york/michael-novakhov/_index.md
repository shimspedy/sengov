Michael "Misha" Novakhov is an American radio host and politician who serves as a member of the New York State Assembly from the 45th district. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, succeeding Steven Cymbrowitz.

Born in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, Soviet Union (now Azerbaijan), Novakhov immigrated to the United States with his family. His father was fortunate enough to escape along with Michael and the rest of his family to America. His Soviet passport showed "Baku" as his place of birth and "Ukrainian" as his nationality, indicating that he has at least one ethnic Ukrainian parent. In an interview, he called himself a "secular Jew". He currently resides in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn.

Before his political career, Novakhov worked in the radio business since 2003. In 2019, he co-founded "Freedom FM", a Russian-language radio station in Brooklyn where he served as a host.

In the November 2022 elections, Novakhov defeated incumbent assemblyman Steven Cymbrowitz by 19 percentage points. As an Assemblyman, Novakhov plans to work to combat rising crime, especially against the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) and Jewish communities, make health care and housing more affordable, and protect the overall quality of life for his constituents and residents across New York State.

Novakhov made headlines when he introduced bill A.7612, which, if passed, would outlaw public smoking of Marijuana, citing both the nuisance created by the smoke and the potential health hazards of second-hand smoke. His proposed bill would largely treat Marijuana smoking like Tobacco smoking, which is banned in Public places in New York City, but the ban is rarely enforced.
