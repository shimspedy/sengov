David G. McDonough is a distinguished member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 14th district, which includes portions of the town of Hempstead in Nassau County on Long Island. He is a member of the Republican Party and was first elected through a special election in 2002.

Born on March 31, 1937, McDonough has had a rich and varied career. He formerly served in the United States Coast Guard and the United States Air Force. After his military service, he pursued higher education and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from Columbia University. He also graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

Before his elected office, McDonough served as the past president of the Nassau County Council of Chambers of Commerce. From 1994 to 1998, he served four terms as president of the Merrick Chamber of Commerce. In 2001, Assemblywoman Kate Murray was elected as clerk of the town of Hempstead, vacating the Assembly seat. As a result, a special election was called, and McDonough was nominated by Republicans as their candidate. In a competitive election, he defeated Democrat Steve November.

In the Assembly, McDonough is the chairman of a Task Force on Public Safety, and is the ranking member on the Assembly Transportation Committee. He and his wife, Carolyn, reside in Merrick, New York and have three children and four grandchildren.

McDonough's contributions to his community extend beyond his political career. He was an original member of the Development Committee for the Merrick Downtown Revitalization Project and was at the forefront in the design and implementation of the programï¿½s various components. He was responsible for developing a four-screen movie theater in the downtown Merrick area. He was a founding member of the Bellmore-Merrick Community Wellness Council, an organization working with various community, business and religious organizations to help prevent substance abuse and improve the quality of life for families and individuals.
