Joseph Angelino was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 3, 2020. His district is comprised of parts of Broome, Chenango, Delaware, Madison, Otsego and Sullivan counties.

As an Assemblyman, Joseph works to protect the interests of New York’s incredible law enforcement agents, ensure veterans have every opportunity to thrive upon returning from service, and fight for the state’s struggling middle class.

Joseph is a lifelong resident of Central New York. From a young age, his parents taught him the value of honesty, hard work, and compassion toward others. These traits helped Joseph to become an exceptional police officer, a police sergeant, and ultimately, Chief of Police of the Norwich Police Department for nearly 20 years.

While serving as the Chief of Police, Joseph was tapped to simultaneously act as the city’s Fire Chief, thus making him responsible for more than half of the city’s budget and personnel from 2006 to 2008.

During a leave of absence from the Norwich Police, Joseph enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1985. It was in the Marines that his natural leadership abilities catapulted him upward through the ranks. A three-time combat veteran over two wars, Joseph served as a tank commander in Desert Storm and an infantry 1st Sgt. during the Iraq Invasion in 2003, and again in 2005, for which he received two Purple Heart medals. Joseph retired from the Marine reserves as a Sergeant Major, the highest enlisted rank, in 2008.

Joseph is active in several other activities outside of his public service. These include past board member, and past president of the Northeast Classic Car Museum and past member of the Norwich Housing Authority. He was also a past member of the Chenango County Traffic Safety Board. Joe currently serves as a volunteer firefighter with the G.L. Rider Hook & Ladder Company of the Norwich Fire Department. In addition to his service medals, he has been awarded the Chenango County Bar Association Liberty Bell Award and the Distinguished Citizen Award for Chenango County.

Joseph is married to Kendall Saber and they reside in Norwich.
