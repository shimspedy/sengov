Amanda Septimo is an American politician from the state of New York. A Democrat, Septimo is the Assemblymember for the 84th district of the New York State Assembly, based in the South Bronx. Her term began in January 2021.

Septimo was born and raised in the South Bronx. She attended Vanderbilt University on a full Posse Foundation scholarship in 2008. With one semester left at Vanderbilt, Septimo moved back to the Bronx to work for Congressman Jos� Serrano. She plans to complete her degree in political science in December 2020.

In 2018, Septimo ran for the New York State Assembly's 84th district, challenging incumbent Carmen Arroyo from the left. Despite receiving high-profile endorsements from 1199SEIU and former City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, Septimo lost in the Democratic primary, 63-37%.

Septimo announced a second run against Arroyo in 2020. Before the Democratic primary could be held, however, Arroyo was removed from the ballot for petition fraud, leaving Septimo as the de facto Democratic nominee. Although Arroyo ran in the general election on the Proven Leader Party line, Septimo defeated her easily and began her term the following January.

Amanda Septimo is a lifelong Bronx resident with a long, rich history of service to the community. Her spirit of activism and community leadership began in her adolescence and can be traced through the entirety of her career. At just 12 years old, Amanda became aware of the prevailing social, economic, and environmental injustices within our community, and soon began to organize around these causes throughout the South Bronx.

While still in her teens, Amanda began working with The Point Community Development Corporation in its teen activist program, A.C.T.I.O.N. It was during this time that Amanda was able to gain the fine-tuned understanding of what advocacy means for people in The Bronx. Playing an integral role in preventing the new jail at Oak Point, getting the Floating Pool to Barretto Point Park, and extending six bus services exposed Amanda to the power of community activism, and the power of a dedication to change.

In these same years, Amanda volunteered with various local and international groups, including the New York City Parks Department. There, she concentrated her efforts on tutoring local youth: teaching them to read, write, and offering vital mentorship and guidance. While volunteering with the International YMCA, Amanda traveled to West Africa and helped plant more than 300 various fruit juice trees, creating a much-needed boost to the ailing local economy. These public service efforts would gain Amanda the recognition of Community Board 2 and the New York Yankees, who awarded her the 2005 Youth Leadership Award.

Amanda went on to receive the prestigious Posse Scholarship, which earned her a full-tuition scholarship to Vanderbilt University. There, she remained actively involved on campus and used the skills and knowledge that she learned at home in The Bronx towards correcting the injustices within her surrounding community. Throughout her college years, Amanda served as an intern with the Legal Aid Society fighting cases of domestic violence, with an emphasis on Spanish-speaking immigrants. Amanda also volunteered with the Metro Public Defenders where she operated as an intern case-work investigator; this work allowed Amanda to plant herself within the community, and tackle cases where defendants were often times victims of a criminal justice system stacked against them.

After her years at Vanderbilt, Amanda brought the work of her youth full circle and went on to work with Congressman Jose E. Serrano � whom she interned with for two years in high school � as a Community Liaison, before being promoted to District Director at 23 years old. In these four years, Amanda was able to observe the powerful connection between policy and opportunities for progress for people in The Bronx. With this expanded experience and sharpened perspective of government, Amanda went on to work with the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators (CSA) to ensure that school leaders and students have the resources they need to transform every school into a thriving learning environment.
