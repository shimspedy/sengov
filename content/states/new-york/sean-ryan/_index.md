Sean M. Ryan is an American attorney and politician serving as a member of the New York State Senate from the 61st District. A Democrat, he previously served as a member of the New York State Assembly from 2011 to 2021, and the 60th District from 2021 to 2022.

Born on March 4, 1965, Ryan earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the State University of New York at Fredonia and a Juris Doctor from Brooklyn Law School. He was then admitted to the New York State Bar Association. As an attorney, Ryan has specialized in anti-discrimination and labor law cases.

On September 13, 2011, Ryan was elected during a special election to the New York State Assembly, succeeding longtime assemblyman Sam Hoyt. In 2012, he was elected to the 149th district. He was supported by the 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East. In 2020, he was elected to New York's 60th senate district. Due to redistricting following the 2020 U.S. census, Ryan successfully ran in the newly-drawn 61st senate district in the 2022 election.

As a member of the State Senate, Ryan championed legislation to prohibit non-compete clauses in New York, which passed both houses of the state legislature in 2023. He also served as the Chairman of Committee on Commerce, Economic Development, and Small Business.

Ryan proudly grew up in Lackawanna, where he learned the value of hard work from his father, who was a firefighter, and his mother, who was a teacher. Western New York is his home, and Western New York values are a part of who he is. As a kid, Sean was taught if you work hard, you will be secure, you will have a place in the economy, and you can live the American dream.

During his senior year in high school, that abruptly came to an end as Bethlehem Steel closed down. Thousands lost their jobs, and family, friends, and neighbors were all displaced in the economy. For generations, Western New York struggled to get back on its feet. In the State Assembly, Sean worked to transform the Western New York economy during his time in office. He learned the lessons of Bethlehem Steel and used those lessons to guide his work to create progress for Buffalo and Western New York.

His legal career highlights include a record award for a victim of housing discrimination, a successful challenge to a school district’s denial of special education services to children enrolled in parochial schools, and an action to compel enforcement of Buffalo’s Living Wage Ordinance. In 2008, Sean began working with People United for Sustainable Housing, Inc. to create a non-profit development entity called the Buffalo Neighborhood Stabilization Company, Inc. (BNSC). Sean served as the Executive Director and General Counsel of BNSC and worked to create a redevelopment plan for a section of the West Side of Buffalo.
