Robert Jackson, born on December 18, 1950, is an American politician based in New York City. He is a member of the Democratic Party and currently serves as the Senator for the New York State Senate's 31st district on the West Side of Manhattan. Prior to this, he served in the New York City Council from 2002 to 2013, representing the 7th district in Manhattan. He is recognized as the first Muslim New York State Senator.

Robert Jackson was born in Harlem, the son of Zelma Jackson and Chinese immigrant Eddie Chu. He grew up in Manhattan and The Bronx, attending P.S.186 in Washington Heights, and P.S. 146, Junior High School 120, and Benjamin Franklin High School in The Bronx. As a child, he sold newspapers. Jackson graduated from the State University of New York at New Paltz in 1975. After college, he worked for the New York State Department of Labor and the Public Employees Federation, a labor union. In 1986, he was elected to New York City Community School Board 6.

In 1992, while serving as the elected president of Community School Board 6, Jackson sued the state, accusing it of under-funding New York City public schools. He sought assistance from the school board's attorney, Michael A. Rebell; they founded the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, and in 1993 filed suit in CFE v. State of New York. The lawsuit argued that the State of New York's method of allocating funds for public education did not provide adequately for children in New York City, and therefore violated the New York State Constitution and the federal Civil Rights Act. On June 26, 2003, the New York State Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) ruled in favor of plaintiffs, and gave the State until July 30, 2004, to implement changes.

Born and raised in Manhattan, Robert and his family have lived in Washington Heights since 1975. He attended New York City public schools and graduated from the State University of New York at New Paltz. He is married and a dedicated father of three daughters, and has run in at least three marathons and climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro with his wife.
