Jose Marco Serrano, born on June 19, 1972, is a lifelong resident of the South Bronx. He is the son of U.S. Congressman Jose Serrano. He graduated from Manhattan College in the Bronx. Before his political career, Serrano worked with the New York Shakespeare Festival, deepening his love for the arts and culture.

In 2001, Serrano was elected to the 17th district of the New York City Council, representing Melrose, Mott Haven, Longwood, and Hunt's Point. He was re-elected in 2003. As Chair of the Councils Committee on Cultural Affairs, Serrano was an outspoken proponent for the arts, libraries, and cultural institutions. He resisted budget cuts to programs in New York City libraries, and, with his colleagues in the Council, restored an average of $20 million each year to maintain library service during the citys fiscal crisis. He also fought to restore $40 million over three years to cultural organizations, especially small, neighborhood-based groups that nurture local artists.

In November 2004, Serrano was elected to the New York State Senate, defeating Republican Olga Mendez, a 26-year incumbent in the district. His district, the 29th Senate District, represents neighborhoods in the South and West Bronx, and Manhattan, including Highbridge, Mott Haven, Port Morris, Hunts Point, Clason Point, Randall's Island, East Harlem/El Barrio, and Yorkville. Since 2019, he has served as the Chair of the Senate Majority Conference, the third highest-ranking member of the Senate.

Serrano serves as the Chair of the Committee on Cultural Affairs, Tourism, Parks and Recreation. His other committee assignments include: Aging, Environmental Conservation, Libraries, Social Services, Veterans, Homeland Security and Military Affairs, and Women's Issues. He has introduced a wide variety of bills championing the arts, keeping housing affordable, protecting public health, fostering economic development, defending immigrant rights, closing the income inequality gap, and preserving the environment.
