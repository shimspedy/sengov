Inez E. Dickens was born on July 15, 1949, and she is currently serving as the Assemblymember for the 70th district of the New York State Assembly. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district she represents includes portions of El Barrio, Hamilton Heights, Harlem, and Morningside Heights in Manhattan.

Before her current role, she served on the New York City Council from 2006 to 2016, representing the 9th district. She is a lifelong resident of New York City. Her father, Lloyd E. Dickens, was a Democratic District Leader and a member of the New York Assembly, and her uncle Thomas K. Dickens was an assemblyman and a justice on the New York Supreme Court.

Inez attended P.S. 133 and Julia Richman High School, and later did undergraduate studies in real estate and land economics at New York University and later at Howard University. She continued her education for graduation in Chicago.

Dickens was first elected to office in 1974 as a State Party Committeewoman, and served in that capacity for 32 years. In the 2004 presidential election, she served as one of New York's 33 presidential electors, casting her ballot for John Kerry.

After Bill Perkins opted to run for the New York State Senate in 2005, Dickens entered the primary for City Council to replace him, and won. She won re-election handily in 2009 and again in 2013. Inez became the councilmember for the 9th New York City Council District in 2006, serving the communities of Central Harlem, Morningside Heights, East Harlem and parts of the Upper West Side. As a newly elected council member, Inez was appointed majority whip and chair of the Committee on Standards and Ethics.

She became the first African-American woman in the history of the New York City Council to be appointed to the positions of deputy majority leader and chair of the Subcommittee on Planning, Dispositions and Concessions. In August 2013, she had $265,000 in unpaid code violations dating as far back as 2004, earning her a spot on the Public Advocate's "Worst Landlord's Watch List." She had previously voted to improve "slumlord accountability."

In 2016, Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, who had served in the Assembly for over 25 years, announced he would run to succeed long-time Congressman Charlie Rangel. Inez E. Dickens is a respected, lifelong resident of the 9th Council District, the daughter of the late Harlem businessman and NYS Assemblyman Lloyd E. Dickens, and the niece of the late NYS Assemblyman and state Supreme Court Justice Thomas K. Dickens. A passion for people and community is in her blood.
