Michelle Hinchey is an American politician serving as a member of the New York State Senate for the 41st district. She was born on November 3, 1987, and is the daughter of former Congressman Maurice Hinchey and Ilene Marder Hinchey.

Hinchey grew up in Saugerties, New York. After graduating from Saugerties High School, she went on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree from Cornell University. Before entering politics, Hinchey worked as a communications executive and served on the board of the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development.

In 2020, Hinchey announced her candidacy for the 46th district of the New York State Senate, which was being vacated by retiring Republican George Amedore. After winning the Democratic primary unopposed, Hinchey narrowly defeated Richard Amedure, her Republican opponent and George Amedore's distant cousin, by a margin of 51–49%.

Hinchey took office in January 2021 as part of the first Democratic Senate supermajority in decades. As a result of 2022 New York redistricting, Hinchey ran for reelection in the newly drawn 41st Senate district, against fellow incumbent Sue Serino. In November 2022, Hinchey won reelection, defeating Republican Serino with 52.5% of the vote to Serino’s 47.6%.

Hinchey serves as chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee and introduced legislation establishing a farm soil health program advocated by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at her alma mater, Cornell University. After Congressman Antonio Delgado was selected to serve as lieutenant governor of New York in May 2022, Hinchey was mentioned as a possible candidate in a special election to fill his vacant House seat.
