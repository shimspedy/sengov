Jeremy Cooney is an American politician from the state of New York. Born on August 1, 1981, Cooney is a member of the Democratic Party and represents the 56th district of the New York State Senate. His district covers parts of the City of Rochester, the Town of Brighton, and the western suburbs of Monroe County.

Cooney was adopted from an orphanage in Kolkata, India, by a single mother in upstate New York. He was raised in Rochester and attended schools in the Rochester City School District, graduating from School of the Arts. Cooney earned his B.A. from Hobart College and his J.D. from Albany Law School, where he served as executive editor of the Albany Law Review.

Before running for elected office, Cooney served as an aide to U.S. Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, a law clerk to New York Governor David Paterson, worked for Empire State Development under Andrew Cuomo, and was the first chief of staff to Mayor Lovely A. Warren of the City of Rochester.

Cooney ran for the 56th Senate District in 2018 and lost to 20-year incumbent Joseph Robach. He ran again in 2020 and won a 3-way primary election before winning the 2020 general election by a margin of 12.6%. He made history as the first Asian to be elected to state office from upstate New York. In November 2022, he defeated Republican Jim VanBrederode and was re-elected to a second term.

As a senator, Cooney serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Procurement and Contracts and is a member of several other committees. He also serves as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Cannabis. In 2022, Cooney sponsored the Green CHIPS Act, legislation that provides state tax incentives to attract semiconductor and high-tech chip manufacturers to New York. The bill was signed into law by Governor Kathy Hochul in August 2022.

Cooney lives in the City of Rochester with his wife, Diane Lu, a urological surgeon at the University of Rochester Medical Center.
