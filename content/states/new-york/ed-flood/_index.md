Ed Flood is an American politician who is currently serving as the assemblyman for New York's 4th assembly district. He is a member of the Republican party and resides in Port Jefferson Station, New York.

Ed was first elected to the New York State Assembly on November 8, 2022. The 4th Assembly District includes parts of Suffolk County including Brookhaven and the villages of Old Field, Poquott, Belle Terre, Port Jefferson, and Lake Grove.

Before his political career, Ed worked as Chief of Staff to Assemblyman Dean Murray and currently owns his own law firm in Port Jefferson. He has pledged to fight to fix New York�s recently-enacted crime measures, including bail reform, Raise the Age, and Less is More legislation. He supports term limits and firmly believes in reversing COVID mandates.

As an Assemblyman, Ed works tirelessly for the constituents within his district, including fighting for funds to help fix crumbling infrastructure. He hopes to bring common-sense legislation back to Albany.

Ed graduated from Comsewogue High School before obtaining his bachelor�s degree from St. Joseph�s University and his law degree from the Western New England University School of Law. He is a lifelong resident of the 4th Assembly District and is eager to get to work for his community.

In his first year in office, Ed publicly criticized Stony Brook University's new proposed parking plan, a plan that would create a tiered system in which lots closest to the University would cost more than those that are farther away.

Ed currently sits on the Committee on Banks, Committee on Children and Families, Committee on Codes, Committee on Environmental Conservation, Committee on Higher Education, and the Committee on Judiciary.
