Kristen Gonzalez is a former tech worker and community organizer, born and raised in a working-class family in Queens. She represents District 59, covering parts of Western Queens, Northern Brooklyn and the East Side of Manhattan. As the youngest woman ever elected to the NYS Senate and Chair of the Internet and Technology Committee, she passed legislation protecting our state’s critical infrastructure from cyber attacks and helped safeguard the right to an abortion by protecting private health data. She believes every New Yorker deserves to life a dignified life, which is why she champions workers’ rights, a Green New York, deeply affordable housing and tenant protections.Before being elected to the NYS Senate, Senator Gonzalez worked in the New York City Council, the Obama White House, and Senator Chuck Schumer’s office. She has also organized in her community with the Western Queens Community Land Trust, served on her community board, and helped launch a citywide campaign for public internet.
