Assembly Member Chantel Jackson, LMSW, stands at the forefront of progressive change, representing District 79 with unwavering dedication and a tireless commitment to her constituents. Serving the neighborhoods of Concourse Village, Melrose, Morrisania, Claremont, Belmont, and East Tremont, she has become a beacon of hope and empowerment for the diverse communities she serves.

Born in the heart of Harlem among six siblings, Chantel's journey to public service was shaped by her upbringing in a close-knit family deeply rooted in their community. Her mother, who immigrated from Belize, instilled in her the values of resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity. Chantel draws inspiration from her father, a business-savvy Workshop and Business Opportunity CEO who started and ran multiple companies. Their entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to community service serve as guiding lights in Chantel's pursuit of social justice and economic empowerment for all.

After earning her bachelor's degree in psychology from City College and completing her graduate studies at Adelphi University, Chantel dedicated nine years to assisting low-income, first-generation students in navigating college admissions and securing vital financial aid. For four years, Chantel was an NYC public high school social worker, assisting students with their mental and physical wellness.

During the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Chantel demonstrated exceptional resilience and compassion as she served her community. In addition to running for office, Chantel balanced providing essential mental health services to her students through teletherapy and distributing food to her community seven days a week.

In her first term in the Assembly, Chantel achieved a significant victory with the passage of a bill requiring a license to purchase or possess a semiautomatic rifle, a crucial step in addressing gun violence in communities across the state. Since assuming office, she has allocated $80,000 in funding toward entrepreneurship initiatives within her district. Additionally, Chantel has dedicated $133,000 towards bolstering mental health programs. She is the chair of the subcommittee on Micro Businesses and serves on the Alcohol and Drug Abuse, Cities, Education, Housing, Small Business, and Mental Health committees.

Beyond her legislative work, Chantel is deeply invested in fostering health, wellness, and entrepreneurship in her community. Through initiatives such as "Strolling for Life," an advocacy event focused on combating infant mortality, and "Secure The Bag: Small Business Resource Fair," she empowers residents to take charge of their well-being and economic futures.

As she enters her second term and fourth year in office, Chantel remains steadfast in her commitment to serving as a voice for the voiceless and a champion for progress. Her dedication to her role and experience as a licensed social worker, college professor, author, and devoted mother to her daughter, Skye, and son, TJ, informs every aspect of her work, driving her relentless pursuit of health, wellness, education, and generational wealth for her community.
