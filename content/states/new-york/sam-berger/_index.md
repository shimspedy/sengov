Sam Berger is an American politician who is currently serving as the representative for New York's 27th State Assembly district. He was elected in a special election in 2023 to replace Daniel Rosenthal, who resigned to take a position at UJA-Federation of New York. Berger is a member of the Democratic Party.

Born and raised in District 27, Sam is deeply ingrained in the community. His father serves as the president of a local elementary school, and his mother, a teacher, also acts as a local district leader. Sam is a product of the very community he represents in Albany. After studying abroad in Israel, he returned to his roots, earning his bachelor's degree and then studying law at St. John's University in Queens.

Assemblymember Berger is a proud husband, and father of two young daughters. Their presence fuels his determination to make Queens a haven where children of any background can prosper. His personal and professional experiences have equipped him with the knowledge and the desire to work tirelessly for his community.

Sam's decision to run for the Assembly in 2023 stems from his belief in the power of the law and how it can affect lives. With Sam's legal background and community-focused perspective, he has successfully navigated the complexities of Albany and enacted laws that benefit his community.

His vision for District 27 is grounded in addressing three key issues: education, public safety, and affordability. Sam believes that education is the bedrock of a prosperous community. Raised in a family that valued education, Sam aims to improve the quality of both public and private education, while also advocating for after-school programs.

Sam passionately advocates for policies that make New York an affordable place to live, nurturing personal growth for all. He will push back against Albany�s high taxes, and New York�s nickel and diming of working-class families. Sam recognizes the pressing need for well-paying jobs that can sustain families, reinforcing the fabric of our local community.

Public safety, a significant concern, is also a priority for Sam. He will fight for your family like they are his own, because he is raising his family alongside yours in the neighborhood. His experiences in the Queens County Supreme Court Criminal term, particularly with gun crimes, underscore his commitment to this issue.
