Joe Sempolinski was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 5, 2024. His district comprises Allegany and Cattaraugus counties and parts of Steuben County.

A former member of the United States House of Representatives and New York State Assembly chief of staff, Joe brings a wealth of federal and state government experience to his elected role in Albany. He is a proud constitutional conservative seeking to defend the principles outlined in our nation and state’s founding documents. This includes a fierce defense and belief in both the First and Second Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.

As a lifelong New Yorker, Joe is aware of the economic difficulties facing the state and will seek to strengthen controls on government spending and foster partnerships with the business community to encourage job creation across all sectors including agriculture. He firmly believes in reducing government mandates and seeks to restore common-sense energy policy that does not jeopardize the state’s future.

Joe previously served as a member of the U.S. House Committee on Education and Labor and will continue to promote an educational environment where students can learn the skills needed to be productive citizens. As a father, he recognizes the importance that including strong parental involvement in curriculum discussions has on the success of the overall learning experience.

Additionally, he believes addressing public safety and support for the law enforcement community must be of greater importance at all levels of government. Joe will work tirelessly to protect crime victims and law-abiding citizens from the violence plaguing New York.

Joe completed a Bachelor of Arts at Georgetown University and later earned a Master of Arts and a Master of Philosophy at Yale University. Joe served as district director for Congressman Tom Reed. He also served as Director of Development at Archbishop Walsh Academy in Olean. Prior to being elected, Joe served as chief of staff for Assemblyman Joseph M. Giglio.

Joe is a lifelong resident of the Southern Tier and lives with his wife, Angie, and their daughters, Joselyn and Madelyn.
