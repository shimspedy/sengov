On November 3, 2020, Keith P. Brown emerged victorious in the New York State Assembly election to represent parts of Suffolk County, encompassing the vibrant towns of Huntington, Babylon, and Islip.

Leveraging his extensive legal insight and background in small business, Keith has embarked on steadfast efforts to bolster the small business community and propel economic growth across Long Island. His work addresses present challenges and paves the way for a future marked by prosperity.

With a family deeply rooted in law enforcement, Keith possesses a unique insight into the complexities associated with New York’s recent criminal justice reforms and the growing push to “defund” the police. In his dedication to ensuring community safety, he has voted to reinstate greater judicial discretion and repeal bail reform measures.

Keith’s commitment extends beyond law and order. He is resolute in his pursuit of lowering taxes, fostering a cleaner Long Island Sound, and attracting increased state investment to tackle water and sewer infrastructure needs. Keith has accomplished this by championing the much-needed Environmental Bond Act and co-authoring a paper about the need for updated sewers.

A proud graduate of SUNY Albany, Keith’s journey includes a pivotal internship with former New York State Senator Norman J. Levy. His legal prowess was honed at Touro College Law Center, where he currently serves on the Advisory Board for the Institute on Land Use and Sustainable Development Law.

Before establishing his law firm, Keith made significant contributions as a litigator. He held a distinguished role at the New York State Office of the Attorney General, serving as Assistant Attorney General in the Litigation Bureau and defending the state in federal and state courts.

As a founding partner of Brown & Altman, LLP, Keith is pivotal in representing diverse corporate clients in complex real estate matters like zoning and land-use regulation.

In his personal life, Keith, alongside his wife Barbara and their three children, calls Northport home—a place where aspirations and accomplishments converge. Together, they are committed to shaping a brighter future for their cherished community.
