Keith P. Brown, born on July 17, 1968, is an American politician from the state of New York. A member of the Republican party, he is currently serving in the New York State Assembly, representing the 12th district. This district encompasses portions of the towns of Babylon, Huntington, and Islip within Suffolk County. He assumed office in January 2021.

While a college student, Brown was an intern for then-state senator Norman Levy. Brown was selected by Suffolk County Republicans as their nominee for a special election scheduled for April 28, 2020, that was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Brown defeated Democratic challenger Michael Marcantonio in 2020, and Marcantonio, who believed mail-in ballots could hand him a tight victory, conceded the race 16 days after election day. The final vote total was 35,190 for Brown and 33,027 for Marcantonio.

In his personal life, Brown is a graduate of SUNY Albany and Touro Law Center. He is a resident of Northport, New York, and lives with his wife, Barbara, and their three children.

On November 3, 2020, Keith P. Brown emerged victorious in the New York State Assembly election to represent parts of Suffolk County, encompassing the vibrant towns of Huntington, Babylon, and Islip. Leveraging his extensive legal insight and background in small business, Keith has embarked on steadfast efforts to bolster the small business community and propel economic growth across Long Island. His work addresses present challenges and paves the way for a future marked by prosperity.

With a family deeply rooted in law enforcement, Keith possesses a unique insight into the complexities associated with New York�s recent criminal justice reforms and the growing push to �defund� the police. In his dedication to ensuring community safety, he has voted to reinstate greater judicial discretion and repeal bail reform measures. Keith�s commitment extends beyond law and order. He is resolute in his pursuit of lowering taxes, fostering a cleaner Long Island Sound, and attracting increased state investment to tackle water and sewer infrastructure needs.

Keith has accomplished this by championing the much-needed Environmental Bond Act and co-authoring a paper about the need for updated sewers. A proud graduate of SUNY Albany, Keith�s journey includes a pivotal internship with former New York State Senator Norman J. Levy. His legal prowess was honed at Touro College Law Center, where he currently serves on the Advisory Board for the Institute on Land Use and Sustainable Development Law. Before establishing his law firm, Keith made significant contributions as a litigator. He held a distinguished role at the New York State Office of the Attorney General, serving as Assistant Attorney General in the Litigation Bureau and defending the state in federal and state courts.

As a founding partner of Brown & Altman, LLP, Keith is pivotal in representing diverse corporate clients in complex real estate matters like zoning and land-use regulation. In his personal life, Keith, alongside his wife Barbara and their three children, calls Northport home�a place where aspirations and accomplishments converge. Together, they are committed to shaping a brighter future for their cherished community.
