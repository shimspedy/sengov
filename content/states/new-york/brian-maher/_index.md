Brian Maher is an American politician who is a member of the New York State Assembly from the 101st district. He was first elected in 2022 and has since been serving his constituents with dedication and commitment.

Before his tenure in the Assembly, Maher served as the Town Supervisor of Montgomery, New York. His political career began when he was elected as the Mayor of the Village of Walden, a position he held from 2009 to 2015. After his tenure as Mayor, he ran for Supervisor of the Town of Montgomery, the area in which the Village of Walden is located in. He later won the race.

In addition to his political roles, Maher has also worked in various capacities in the public sector. He served as a communications director for the office of State Senator Bill Larkin. His dedication to public service is evident in his decision to join the United States Navy Reserves in 2018.

Maher first ran for the 101st State Assembly district in 2012, placing second in the Republican primary to then-incumbent Claudia Tenney. In early 2022, Maher announced his second campaign for the same district. After winning the election, he was sworn in on January 3, 2023.

As an Assemblyman, Maher focuses on addressing years of wasteful spending in Albany and pushes for a permanent state spending cap to reduce taxes and the financial burden crippling New York families and small businesses. He understands the importance of prioritizing the health and safety of citizens and works to address spikes in crime to allow neighborhoods and businesses to prosper.

Steadfast in his commitment to New York�s veterans, he advocates for expanded outreach and educational opportunities. Especially important to the Assemblyman, Brian works to address the issue of youth flight, advocating for more workforce development opportunities and working with healthcare agencies and community organizations to curb opioid and drug abuse.

Brian Maher originally attended Post University on a basketball scholarship before transferring to Brooklyn College where he found his passion for advocacy and public service. Inspired by Sen. Larkin�s military experience and leadership, Brian joined the United States Navy Reserves in 2018. Additionally, Brian is the co-founder of Hudson Valley Honor Flight and Big Apple Honor Flight which honor the service of local area veterans.

Brian resides in Montgomery with his wife Rebecca and their three children.
