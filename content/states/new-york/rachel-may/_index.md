Rachel May is an American academic, university administrator, and politician. She is a member of the New York State Senate, representing the 48th district since 2023, and the 53rd district from 2019-2022. The district comprises Syracuse, New York and surrounding communities.

Senator May represents Central New York’s 48th District, including the City of Syracuse, parts of Onondaga County, and Cayuga County. She is the chair of the Cities 2 Committee and the Legislative Commission on Rural Resources. She is a member of the committees on Aging, Agriculture, Elections, Environmental Conservation, Health, Housing, Construction & Community Development, Joint Senate Task Force on Opioids, Addiction & Overdose Prevention, Legislative Women's Caucus, and State-Native American Relations.

As a freshman legislator in the 2019 session, Senator May was instrumental in passing transformative legislation, including comprehensive election reforms, tenant-centered housing reforms, unprecedented criminal justice reform, and the nation’s most ambitious climate legislation. She has worked hard to bring the people of Central New York into the process of decision-making in Albany by holding a record number of legislative hearings in the region on issues including the Climate Leadership and Community Preservation Act, rural broadband, farm labor rights, health care for all, and Upstate nursing home issues during the COVID-19 crisis.

In addition, she has brought her Downstate colleagues to Central New York for roundtables on opioid addiction treatment and prevention, minority and women-owned businesses, and childcare and child welfare. She sponsored and passed into law a bill to create the first regional STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) school for Central New York, which is currently under construction in the City of Syracuse.

As former chair of the Senate Committee on Aging, she vigorously supported home care workforce initiatives, expanded funding for in-home care programs, the Long-term Care Ombudsman Program, and nursing home accountability. She sponsored bills to create a Reimagining Long Term Care Task Force, authorize a family caregiver tax credit, and create a home care jobs innovation fund to support workforce growth.

As chair of the Cities 2 Committee, Senator May focuses on New York State’s many vibrant cities outside of New York City. Since her first election in 2018, Rachel has fought hard for the people of Central New York. During her time in office, the Legislature has passed early voting and other significant election reforms, protected New Yorkers' reproductive rights, and passed the strongest climate protection legislation in the country.
