Bill Weber is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the New York State Senate from the 38th District since 2023. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Weber's political journey began with a significant victory. He defeated incumbent Democrat Elijah Reichlin-Melnick in the 2022 election, marking the start of his tenure in the State Senate. His district includes the towns of Clarkstown, Haverstraw, Orangetown, and Ramapo in Rockland County.

Before his political career, Weber was deeply involved in the business sector. He graduated from Pace University in 1991 with a degree in public accountancy. He then worked as the Chief Financial Officer for a medium-sized, family-run business. His experience in the business world provided him with valuable insights and skills that he would later bring to his political career.

In addition to his business and political roles, Weber has also been active in community service. He has served as a Cub Scout leader and a board member for both the Mental Health Association and the Rockland County Youth Bureau. These roles reflect his commitment to serving his community and making a positive impact on the lives of those around him.

Weber's work in the Senate is marked by his involvement in various committees. He is the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Budget and Revenue. He also serves on several other committees, including Consumer Protection, Disabilities, Education, and Elections. His work on these committees allows him to influence and shape policies in a wide range of areas.

On a personal note, Weber is a lifelong resident of Rockland County. He and his wife, Lisa, are the proud parents of four children. As a family man, a businessman, and a public servant, Weber's life is marked by a commitment to his community, his family, and the principles of his party.
