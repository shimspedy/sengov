Robert G. Ortt was sworn into office as a New York State Senator for the 62nd District in January of 2015. From January 1st, 2010 to December 31st, 2014, Rob served as Mayor of North Tonawanda. In that role, he developed executive experience with an in-depth understanding of local government. Prior to becoming Mayor, he served as the City Treasurer and then, Clerk-Treasurer of North Tonawanda. On April 3rd, 2007, Rob was appointed as City Treasurer by the Common Council. On November 6th, 2007, he was elected to serve a four-year term by his fellow citizens, which began on January 1st, 2008, after he was officially sworn in at City Hall. On November 4th, 2008, the people of North Tonawanda voted to eliminate the position of City Clerk and combine the offices of the City Clerk and City Treasurer to form one position of Clerk-Treasurer, making Rob the first-ever City official to hold that title.

Rob enlisted in N.Y. Army National Guard in October 2001 in direct response to the attacks on September 11th. He is a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, where he served from March 2008 until December of the same year. His mission was to serve as a combat mentor/advisor to the Afghan National Police in Kandahar City, the second-largest city in Afghanistan. As the Executive Officer /Unit Movement Officer for an infantry company, he was responsible for ensuring that all the logistical needs of the company were met to facilitate operational readiness, coordinate and run all company meetings, and act as the commander in his absence. He successfully moved $10 million worth of equipment to Afghanistan and back to the United States.

He is the recipient of the Bronze Star, the Army Commendation Medal, the Afghan Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge in recognition of his service.

Prior to entering public service, Rob served as an independent personal financial analyst with Primerica Financial Services. There, he held multiple licenses, including the series 6 & 63 investment licenses, mortgage broker license, and NYS life insurance license. He specialized in assisting middle-income families to reduce their debt and save enough to be able to retire with dignity.

At the start of the 2019 Legislative session, Rob became the Ranking Member of the New York State Senate Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Veterans, Homeland Security, and Military Affairs. One of the accomplishments he is most proud of was introducing and expanding the Joseph P. Dwyer Program across western New York. The program provides peer-to-peer support program for veterans facing the challenges of post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injuries, and reintegration into civilian life.

In June of 2020, Rob was elected the Minority Leader by his colleagues in the Republican Conference.

Rob lives in North Tonawanda with his wife, Meghan.
