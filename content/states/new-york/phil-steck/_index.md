Born on July 8, 1959, Phil Steck is a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly representing Assembly District 110, which comprises the eastern portions of Schenectady and northern portions of Albany County.

Early Life and Career:
Steck is the son of Ernest, a high school athletic director, and Roselyn, a middle school teacher. He played varsity football and graduated as the valedictorian of his class from The Albany Academy in 1977. He earned a degree in Government from Harvard University in 1981 and a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1984. In college, he interned on the staff of Congressman Ben Rosenthal. For several years after college, he worked as an assistant district attorney in New York and Rensselaer Counties. He then entered private practice for the Capital District law firm of Cooper Erving & Savage where he has worked ever since.

Political Career:
Steck's political career began in 1999 when he was elected to the Albany County Legislature; he served three terms there. In 2008, he ran for Congress in New York's 21st congressional district, but lost in the Democratic primary. In 2012, Steck won a seat in the New York State Assembly. He endorsed Bernie Sanders for the 2020 Primary.

His major legislative interests include single-payer health insurance (Medicare for All), expanding membership in County self-insured health plans to embrace all municipalities so as to reduce health insurance costs funded by taxpayers, reducing heavy-handed practices of State administrative agencies, raising revenue through the stock transfer tax to support rebuilding the infrastructure of Upstate New York, increased funding for public education to meet levels promised in prior legislation, and oversight of the Office of Court Administration.
