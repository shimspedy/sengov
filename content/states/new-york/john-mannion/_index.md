Senator John W. Mannion is a lifelong Central New Yorker and the grandchild of Irish immigrants. His mother worked at New York Telephone and his father for New York Central Railroad, raising John and his siblings on Syracuse's famous Tipperary Hill. He now resides in Geddes with his wife, Jennifer. They have three children, two in college and one recently graduated.

John is a graduate of the SUNY System, attending Binghamton and Oswego. He brings to the Senate nearly three decades of classroom experience as a teacher in the public school system. He spent twenty-one years as an Advanced Placement Biology and Chemistry teacher at the West Genesee School District in Onondaga County.

He has been a strong advocate for teachers and students, negotiating labor contracts and representing educators in his capacity as President of the West Genesee Teachers’ Association.

He has been embedded in his community for decades, volunteering with many organizations while coaching and refereeing soccer, basketball and baseball. The Mannion family loves the people and places of Central New York and they enjoy the diverse cultures and historical significance of the region.

Elected to his first term in 2020, Senator Mannion proudly serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Disabilities. As Chairman, he has built a strong legislative record advocating for the state’s most vulnerable citizens. Senator Mannion has secured the first cost of living increase for DSPs, expanded the preferred source program to boost employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, mandated a report by OPWDD on the agency’s pandemic response, and continues to work towards solutions to address the critical workforce and housing shortages.
