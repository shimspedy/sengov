Andrew Molitor was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 5, 2024. The 150th Assembly District serves all of Chautauqua County.

Andrew was previously a prosecutor and Chautauqua County’s first assistant district attorney. He is also the former president of the Bar Association of Northern Chautauqua. He brings extensive experience and expertise to the Assembly with his profound knowledge of the state’s legal system. He is deeply committed to increasing public safety and believes there is a great need to enact change to the state’s bail laws. He is determined to see further rollbacks of current criminal justice reforms while equipping law enforcement with the tools needed to protect law-abiding citizens and hold criminals accountable.

As a father of five, Andrew recognizes the financial challenges families face daily. He is committed to lowering the cost of living by cutting wasteful spending and reducing taxes. Andrew will champion efforts to reduce utility costs and fight against proposed bans on natural gas and appliances. Additionally, Andrew knows the critical importance of strong schools and will fight to ensure the education system receives top-tier funding.

Andrew has been a long-time advocate of business growth. Raising his family in Chautauqua County, he is deeply invested in his community and believes that fostering economic prosperity requires reducing burdensome regulations and lowering taxes. He is a staunch advocate of creating a stronger economy by supporting policies that help businesses thrive.

Andrew shares serious concerns with proposed Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) wetland regulations and their impact on Chautauqua Lake. Andrew wrote to the DEC expressing concerns about how the regulations might impact Chautauqua Lake, as lakes are excluded from the wetland designation.

Andrew runs a men’s ministry and is a catechist at the Chautauqua Family of Catholic Churches. He lives in Westfield with his wife Celia, and their five children.
