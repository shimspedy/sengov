Joaquim "Jack" M. Martins was born on June 19, 1967, in Queens, New York. He is a first-generation Portuguese American, born to parents who emigrated to the United States in the 1960s. He has two brothers and two sisters and was raised in Mineola.

After graduating from Chaminade High School, he pursued his higher education at American University, where he received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1988. He then went on to complete a Juris Doctor from St. John's University School of Law in 1991.

Martins started his political career as the mayor of the Village of Mineola, New York, a position he held from 2004 to 2010. In 2008, he ran for Congress against incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative Carolyn McCarthy but was defeated by a wide margin.

In 2010, Martins won the election to the New York State Senate as the representative for New York's 7th State Senate district. He defeated incumbent Democratic senator Craig M. Johnson by 451 votes. The election results were not certified until December 4, 2010. Johnson challenged the results and demanded a hand recount, but the New York Court of Appeals rejected his appeal on December 20, 2010.

As a Senator, Martins voted for the law creating New York State's property tax cap, voted to cut income taxes for middle-class homeowners, voted to repeal the MTA payroll tax for small businesses and schools, and supported repealing the MTA payroll tax in its entirety. He authored laws reducing busing costs for school districts, creating a truss notification system to improve safety for volunteer firefighters, and establishing a new state fund to help homeless veterans.

In 2011, Martins voted against allowing same-sex marriage in New York during rollcall for the Marriage Equality Act, which narrowly passed, legalizing it by 33 to 29. Martins was highly critical of the New York State Education Department's implementation of the Common Core standards and called for the resignation of the State's Commissioner of Education for cancelling public forums on the issue with parents and teachers.

Martins is currently serving as a member of the New York State Senate for the 7th district since January 1, 2023.
