Brian D. Miller is an American politician and mechanical engineer, currently representing the 122nd District in the New York State Assembly. The district includes portions of Herkimer, Madison, Oneida, and Otsego counties.

Miller is native of Utica, New York. A graduate of Mohawk Valley Community College, Miller has worked as a mechanical engineer for over 30 years. In 1999, Miller was elected to the Oneida County Legislature, and later served as its chairman of the Public Works Committee, assistant majority leader, and as a member of the Ways and Means Committee. He also was Bridgewater Town Supervisor for eight years.

After Assemblywoman Claudia Tenney was elected to United States House of Representatives in 2016, Miller opted to fill her vacant seat in the New York State Assembly. He defeated Maria Kelso in the Republican primary, winning the nomination by a 54 to 46 percent margin. In the general election, Miller defeated Democrat Arlene Feldmeier and Kelso again, with over 54 percent of the vote in the three-way race. He was sworn into office in 2017 to succeed Tenney.

Miller resides in New Hartford, New York with his wife and son. In March 2020, he was hospitalized with COVID-19, the fourth Assemblymember to be diagnosed.

Miller was assigned to the following committees: Agriculture Committee, Consumer Affairs and Protection Committee, Higher Education Committee, Real Property Taxation Committee, and Transportation Committee.
