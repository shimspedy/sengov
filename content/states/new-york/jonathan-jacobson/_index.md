Jonathan Jacobson is a multi-faceted personality in the world of film and television production. He grew up in the small town of Chester, Connecticut, where he was literally surrounded by movies. His parents owned and operated a local video store, which sparked his interest in films from a young age.

After exhausting the narrative possibilities that directing his friends with his camcorder allowed, he decided to take his passion for filmmaking to the next level. He attended NYU's Tisch Film School, one of the most prestigious film schools in the world, to hone his skills and knowledge in filmmaking.

While a student at Tisch, he worked on Larry Clark's infamous feature "Kids" (1995). This experience led him to production work on other New York City indies and music videos. He has been working in New York's film and television production industry ever since, contributing to the vibrant and diverse media landscape of the city.

Despite his busy schedule, Jonathan never stopped writing screenplays. In 2022, he sold his original spec screenplay, "The Kill Room". The screenplay went into production in May of 2022, starring renowned actors Uma Thurman and Samuel L Jackson. This achievement marked a significant milestone in his career, showcasing his talent not only as a producer and director but also as a writer.

Jonathan's work spans various roles in the film industry, including producer, director, writer, cinematographer, and editor. Some of his notable works include "Joke Man" (2023), "David Chase: A Sopranos Session" (2020), "The Last Supper: A Sopranos Session" (2020), and "The Broken and the Bad" (2020).

In addition to his work in film and television, Jonathan has also made significant contributions to the field of antitrust law. He was appointed by Congress in 2002 to serve on the Antitrust Modernization Commission, which is dedicated to studying the nation's antitrust laws and considering potential changes. He also serves as the editorial chair of the American Bar Association's Antitrust Law Developments and has chaired a number of ABA Antitrust Section committees.

Jonathan Jacobson's journey is a testament to his passion for storytelling and his commitment to his craft. His work continues to inspire and entertain audiences around the world.
