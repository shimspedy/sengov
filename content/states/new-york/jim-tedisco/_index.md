Before his current role, Tedisco served in the New York State Assembly from 1983 to 2017. During this time, he held the position of Assembly Minority Leader from November 2005 until his resignation from that post in April 2009.

While at Union, he played varsity basketball for three years, setting 15 scoring and assist records, and left as Union's all-time leading scorer with 1,632 points. Tedisco earned multiple athletic awards during his college career, and was inducted into the Union Athletics Hall of Fame in 2002. In 1997, he was given the Silver Anniversary Award from the NCAA.

After completing his undergraduate studies, Tedisco obtained a graduate degree in Special Education from the College of Saint Rose. From 1973 to 1982, he worked in education; he served as a guidance counselor, basketball coach, and athletic director at Notre Dame-Bishop Gibbons High School in Schenectady, and later worked as a special education teacher, resource room instructor and varsity basketball coach at Bethlehem Central High School in Delmar, New York.
