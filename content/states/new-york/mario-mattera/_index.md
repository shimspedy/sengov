Mario R. Mattera, born on August 18, 1963, is an American politician. He is a member of the Republican party and is currently serving in the New York State Senate. He represents the 2nd district, which includes a sizeable portion of the north shore of central Long Island, including all of the town of Smithtown and portions of the towns of Brookhaven and Huntington.

Before running for office, Mattera served as the business agent of the United Association Plumbers Local 200, and was a member of the organization for four decades. He was first elected to the state senate in 2020, defeating former state trooper Michael Siderakis with 57.7% of the vote. He was sworn into office on January 5, 2021.

In the Senate, Mattera is a ranking member of the Consumer Protection and the Corporations, Authorities, and Commissions committees, and is a member of the Labor and Transportation committees.

Mattera and his wife, Terry, live in St. James, New York, and have two daughters, named Jessica and Jayme. He is a lifelong resident of Smithtown and has lived and worked in the 2nd Senate District his entire life. As a longtime union leader in the Plumbers Local Union #200, he has cultivated a keen understanding of the needs of hard-working men and women and how a good economic climate is essential to helping local businesses create much-needed jobs that provide workers with decent pay and benefits.

As a father and husband, he is personally aware that the key to achieving all of this is ensuring that everyone has access to a quality education. His understanding and local experience is essential to his ability to serve the residents of the 2nd Senate District and bring their voice to Albany.

In his role as a member and leader of the Plumbers Local Union #200 union for over 39 years, Mario has dedicated himself to working to protect the needs of Long Island�s workers and their families. During his time with Local #200, he has helped create brighter futures for the over 1,300 working men and women of the union and manage over $250 million in benefit funds to protect their futures. It has also provided him with the opportunity to help his fellow union brothers and sisters gain access to good paying jobs while ensuring that they have safe work environments, strong benefits and a proper retirement.

For his work on behalf of his fellow members, Senator Mattera has been presented with the Order Sons of Italy in America�s Golden Lion Award as 2019�s Labor Leader of the Year as well as the PBA Columbia�s 2012 Labor Leader of the Year. Mario has also led the way for the younger generation of union employees by serving 25 years as a board member on the apprenticeship program at Plumbers Local Union #200 to improve the opportunities of our young workers and to ensure that our region has a qualified workforce.
