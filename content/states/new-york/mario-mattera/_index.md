Senator Mario Mattera was first elected to the 2nd Senate District of the New York State Senate in November of 2020 and sworn into office on January 5, 2021. He won reelection in November of 2022 and is now in his second term representing the residents of the Towns of Huntington and Smithtown.

As someone who has lived and worked in the 2nd Senate District his entire life, Mario understands the needs of local families and the need to reduce the impact Albany’s tax burden is placing on our way of life. As a longtime union leader in the Plumbers Local Union #200, he has cultivated a keen understanding of the needs of our hard-working men and women and how a good economic climate is essential to helping local businesses create much-needed jobs that provide workers with decent pay and benefits. And as a father and husband, he is personally aware that the key to achieving all of this is ensuring that everyone has access to a quality education.

Senator Mattera’s understanding and local experience is essential to his ability to serve the residents of the 2nd Senate District and bring their voice to Albany.

In his role as a member and leader of the Plumbers Local Union #200 union for over 39 years, Mario has dedicated himself to working to protect the needs of Long Island’s workers and their families. During his time with Local #200, he has helped create brighter futures for the over 1,300 working men and women of the union and manage over $250 million in benefit funds to protect their futures. It has also provided him with the opportunity to help his fellow union brothers and sisters gain access to good paying jobs while ensuring that they have safe work environments, strong benefits and a proper retirement.

For his work on behalf of his fellow members, Senator Mattera has been presented with the Order Sons of Italy in America’s Golden Lion Award as 2019’s Labor Leader of the Year as well as the PBA Columbia’s 2012 Labor Leader of the Year. Mario has also led the way for the younger generation of union employees by serving 25 years as a board member on the apprenticeship program at Plumbers Local Union #200 to improve the opportunities of our young workers and to ensure that our region has a qualified workforce.

Mario works just as hard for his fellow Long Islanders by dedicating his time to his community. To ensure that all have a better quality of life, he has dedicated himself to helping local organizations and has served on the St. Catherine’s Health And Wellness Advisory Board, the Suffolk County Water Authority, the Community Association of Greater St. James and the Smithtown Advisory Board for new construction projects.

Mario was also recently honored by the Paige Keely Foundation for his work to protect the young residents of Long Island and by the Celebrate St. James for his work in his hometown.

Mario’s work with the Smithtown Advisory Board was part of their successful effort to work with former Senator John Flanagan to secure millions in state funding for sewers in the area. This funding will soon help deliver sewers in the Smithtown, Kings Park and St. James business districts to protect our environment while also enhancing business opportunities for local business owners, leading to more jobs for those in the area.

Additionally, Mario has joined efforts with the Work Force Housing Committee, Helmets to Hardhats for our returning veterans and the Long Island Housing Partnership where he assisted in their Superstorm Sandy relief program to help people in trying times.

While Mario has undertaken these efforts for the betterment of his community, he is proud to have been recognized by the Children’s Museum at Hallock Farm, St. Catherine of Siena Medical Center and the Ward Melville Heritage Organization for his efforts.

Senator Mattera lives in St. James with his wife Terry and their daughters Jessica and Jayme.
