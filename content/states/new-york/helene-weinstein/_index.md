Helene E. Weinstein is an American politician who represents District 41 in the New York State Assembly. The district comprises Sheepshead Bay, Flatlands, East Flatbush, Midwood, and Canarsie.

Born on September 6, 1952, in Brooklyn, New York, Weinstein was educated in the New York City public school system. She received her Bachelor's degree in economics from American University and a law degree from the New England School of Law.

Weinstein was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 1980. She currently chairs the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee and is a member of the standing committees on Aging, Codes, and Rules. She previously chaired the Assembly Committee on Governmental Employees, Election law, and Judiciary, and the Assembly Task Force on Women's Issues for seven years.

Weinstein is renowned for her advocacy work on behalf of veterans, crime victims, and the disabled. Throughout her career, she has secured funding for various community, senior youth, and school organizations that provide essential services to residents in the 41st Assembly District.

She is the first woman in New York State's history to be appointed to the position of Chair of the Assembly Standing Committee on Judiciary. The Judiciary Committee presides over virtually all legislation affecting the state's judicial system, Family and Domestic Relations Law, Trusts and Estates, as well as civil practice in the courts.

Weinstein has sponsored major reforms in the state's jury system and is the leading proponent of ensuring civil legal services for low-income New Yorkers. She led the successful effort to increase 18B and Law Guardian rates. Weinstein is also a member of the Court Facilities Capital Review Board.

She has been involved in the drafting and passage of several key pieces of legislation, especially with respect to family law. She is the sponsor of the Family Protection and Domestic Violence Intervention Act, as well as the Child Support Standards Act. Weinstein has previously served as an appointee of former Governor Mario Cuomo to the New York State Child Support Commission and the Governor's Commission on Domestic Violence.

Over her political career since 1998, the two groups contributing the greatest amounts to her campaigns have been trial lawyers/lobbyists and public sector unions.

Weinstein holds a B.A. in Economics from American University as well as a degree from the New England School of Law. She is of counsel to her family's personal-injury law firm, Weinstein, Chase, Messinger & Peters, P.C. She has been licensed to practice law in New York since 1977.
