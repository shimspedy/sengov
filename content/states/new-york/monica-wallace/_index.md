Monica P. Wallace is an esteemed member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 143rd Assembly District. This district includes the Erie County towns of Cheektowaga and Lancaster, along with the villages of Depew, Lancaster, and Sloan.

Born and raised on Long Island, Monica was the first person in her family to earn a college degree, embodying the values of hard work and education instilled in her from a young age. She worked her way through college and law school, earning her undergraduate degree with honors from SUNY Binghamton, and her J.D., cum laude, from SUNY Buffalo Law School.

Before her election to the Assembly in 2016, Monica spent much of her legal career as a law clerk in federal court, where she helped ensure that justice was served and that laws were applied equally to all parties appearing before the court. She also served on the faculty at her alma mater, SUNY Buffalo Law School, teaching students how the law can be used as a vehicle for positive social change.

In addition to her legal career, Monica is an active member of her community. She served as a local and state director for the Western New York Chapter of the Women’s Bar Association of the State of New York, an organization dedicated to advancing the status of women and children in New York. She also served as a member of the Lancaster YMCA Board and served on the Legal Writing Institute’s Bar Outreach Committee.

Monica’s legislative priorities include strengthening public education, standing up for working families, creating jobs by supporting economic development, upgrading local infrastructure, and restoring integrity to government.

Monica resides in the town of Lancaster with her husband, John, and their two children, Jack and Claire.
