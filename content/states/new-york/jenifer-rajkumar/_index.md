Jenifer Rajkumar is an American politician and a member of the Democratic party. She represents the 38th district in the New York State Assembly, which includes the Queens neighborhoods of Glendale, Ozone Park, Richmond Hill, Ridgewood, and Woodhaven. She made history as the first Indian-American woman ever elected to a New York State Office.

Born on September 1, 1982, in New York City, Jenifer is the daughter of immigrants from India who first settled in Queens. She attended Hackley School as a teenager and later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School. At Penn, she received the Alice Paul Award for exceptional community service to women and families.

Before her political career, Jenifer served as an adjunct professor of political science at CUNY's Lehman College in the Bronx. In 2011, she became the first Indian American elected as the District Leader of the 65th District of the New York State Assembly, defeating a 28-year incumbent with over 70% of the vote. She was re-elected to that office two more times, in 2013 and 2015. As district leader, Rajkumar led the effort to bring M9 bus service back to Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan.

In 2013, Rajkumar ran for the New York City Council in the Democratic primary in New York City's first Council district, losing to incumbent Margaret Chin. Rajkumar's campaign championed affordable housing and community-friendly development. She was endorsed by various organizations and unions, such as The Sierra Club, and local Allied Craftworkers and Ironworkers groups.

She ran for the New York State Assembly in the 65th District, as the seat was occupied by Alice Cancel, the winner of a special election on April 19, 2016, to replace Sheldon Silver, who was convicted of corruption and expelled from the Assembly in 2015. Rajkumar finished second in a six-way Democratic primary; the winner, Yuh-Line Niou, went on to win in the general election in November.

Jenifer Rajkumar's legislative achievements are nationally recognized. She passed a milestone legislative package that gives domestic workers the full protections of New York State Human Rights Law. She passed a landmark bill establishing New York Stateï¿½s first-ever Asian American & Pacific Island (AAPI) Commission. As a strong advocate for public safety, Jenifer passed a bill to expand compensation for victims of crime, which the Governor signed into law.

Jenifer also has the distinction of serving as Senior Advisor to the Transition Team of New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Previous to her election to the State Legislature, she served as Director of Immigration Affairs for New York State. In this role, she built and led a first-in-the-nation $31 million project to assist immigrants in obtaining legal services. Jenifer also practiced as a civil rights lawyer at a national law firm, where she litigated class action cases on behalf of workers, tenants and women.
