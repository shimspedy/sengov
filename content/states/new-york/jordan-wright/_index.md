Jordan J.G. Wright is a dedicated public servant and the Assemblyman for New York’s 70th District in Harlem. A lifelong New Yorker and resident of Central Harlem, Jordan graduated from Syracuse University in 2017 with a degree in psychology. 

After college, Jordan worked as an educator in multiple Manhattan schools, serving as a trusted mentor to countless students, with many of whom he continues to stay in close touch. Jordan’s time as an educator has informed the great emphasis he puts on strengthening our education system through his work in the Assembly.

Jordan also served for a number of years on his local community board, honing his passions for affordable housing, healthcare access, and public safety for his community. Jordan’s tenure coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic, which highlighted the need for responsive local government for all Harlem residents. 

More recently, Jordan served as Chief of Staff for New York City Council Member Yusef Salaam, an exonerated member of the Central Park Five. In that capacity, Jordan focused on delivering strong constituent services before resigning to take his seat in the Assembly in January 2025. 

Jordan is the son of former Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright and the grandson of former New York Supreme Court Judge Bruce Wright. He is a member of St. Phillip’s Episcopal Church and is a longtime Knicks, Jets, and Yankees fan.
