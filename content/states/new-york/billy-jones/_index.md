Billy Jones is a dedicated public servant and a member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 115th District. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district he represents includes Clinton and Franklin counties, as well as a portion of St. Lawrence County.

Born on November 8, 1974, Jones is a lifelong resident of the North Country. He grew up on a dairy farm, which instilled in him a strong work ethic from a young age. After graduating high school, Jones ran his family’s dairy farm and began work as a corrections officer with the New York State Department of Corrections, where he served for nearly twenty years.

Jones first entered public service in 2009 when he was elected as the Mayor of Chateaugay, New York. He served in this role for four years. In 2010, he was elected to the Franklin County Legislature, where he served as the Chairman from 2013 to 2016. During his tenure, Jones was known for his commitment to government transparency and successfully reformed ethics laws.

In 2016, Jones was elected to the New York State Assembly, succeeding Janet Duprey. He was the first Democrat to represent Clinton County in the state legislature in over half a century. Jones was sworn in for his first term on January 1, 2017. He ran unopposed and was reelected in 2018 for a second term.

Outside of his political career, Jones is active with various organizations throughout the North Country, including the Chateaugay Rotary Club and the Malone Elks Lodge. He was a board member of the United Way of the Adirondack Region and is also a member of the North Country Economic Development Council, where he has supported numerous projects that help local businesses grow the region’s economy.

In the Assembly, Jones’s legislative priorities include lowering taxes for middle-class families, improving the education system, rooting out government corruption, and creating good-paying jobs so North Country families can thrive for generations to come.

Jones is the proud father of a daughter, Ella Liberty Jones, born on July 4th. His personal and professional experiences have shaped his approach to public service, and he continues to work tirelessly for the people of the North Country.
