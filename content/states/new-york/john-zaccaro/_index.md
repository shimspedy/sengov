John Zaccaro Jr. is a dedicated public servant representing the 80th District of the New York State Assembly. Born and raised in the Bronx by a single mother, John has firsthand experience with the challenges that face his community every day, including housing insecurity, rising crime rates, subpar public education, and a decreasing quality of life.

John's journey in public service began as an intern for the New York City Council, where he learned the functions of government and its role in the local community. His lived experiences led him to become a Housing Organizer, where he fought against poor living conditions and unwarranted rent increases. He worked with local community-based organizations to take on abusive landlords in court and defend the rights of tenants.

Following his work at the Council, John was appointed to serve as the Bronx Director for Intergovernmental Affairs under Chancellor Carmen Farina. In this role, he used his voice to highlight the inequalities of the failing public school system.

John's commitment to service and his community continues in his capacity as a Member of the Pelham Parkway Neighborhood Association and former Board Member at Bronx Community Board 7. He resides in the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx with his wife, Daniella, and their three beautiful children, Judah, Miah, and Ethan.

John's career in public service took a significant turn when he decided to run for election to the New York State Assembly to represent District 80. He won in the general election on November 8, 2022, and assumed office on January 1, 2023. His current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Throughout his career, John Zaccaro Jr. has shown a deep commitment to uplifting the communities he grew up in and providing opportunities for his neighbors. With over 14 years of local service to the Bronx community, including his stellar tenure as Chief of Staff for Councilmember Rafael Salamanca, John brings a sense of rejuvenation and vigor to the 80th District of the New York State Assembly.
