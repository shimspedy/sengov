Ken Blankenbush is an American politician and a Republican member of the New York State Assembly. He was born on September 14, 1947, in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, U.S. He is a longtime resident of Black River, New York, U.S.

Blankenbush graduated from Rush-Henrietta High School in Henrietta, New York. After completing two years at Monroe Community College, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in history from the State University of New York at Plattsburgh.

He served in the United States Air Force from 1968 to 1976, during which he was deployed and served in Vietnam and was then stationed at Plattsburgh Air Force Base. In 1976, Blankenbush began his professional career with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and worked his way up to branch manager of the regional office in Watertown. After a successful tenure at Metropolitan, he left to start BEL Associates, his own insurance and financial services business in Watertown.

A town councilman for the town of Le Ray for eight years, Blankenbush went on to serve his community as a member of the Jefferson County Board of Legislators, and served two terms as chairman. In November 2010, he was elected to the State Assembly.

His district includes Lewis County and parts of Oswego, Saint Lawrence and Jefferson Counties. He succeeded former assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava, a liberal Republican who retired. His proposal, “Upstate Strong,” would put government back in the hands of taxpayers. The plan also would make government more fiscally responsible, elections more equitable, and would invest in job creation, strengthen education, and promote the North Country’s agricultural heritage.
