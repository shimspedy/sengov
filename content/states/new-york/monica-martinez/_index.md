New York State Senator Monica R. Martinez came to this country at the age of three and witnessed her parents sacrifice so much and worked hard to give her and her siblings the opportunity to succeed.  Her strong family values and foundation has led her to a life of public service.  She has dedicated her life to the belief; if individuals are given the opportunity to thrive through education and information, every dream can become a reality.  Senator Martinez is a proud Brentwood High School alum and a graduate of Binghamton University, having earned a Bachelor of Arts in History.  She later attended New York University, obtaining a Master’s degree in Secondary Education with a concentration in Social Studies and obtained her administrative degree at Stony Brook University in 2008.

  In 2010, Senator Martinez was selected to lead the administration of Brentwood’s East Middle School as Assistant Principal where she dedicated much of her time enriching the lives of her students. From there, Senator Martinez began her career in government as the County Legislator for Suffolk County’s Ninth District in 2014, where she faithfully served for five years. In collaboration with the County Executive, Martinez offered FREE summer programs for four (4) consecutive years in Brentwood, Central Islip, and North Bay Shore.

Moreover, she funded numerous anti-gang/anti-violence programs through local non-profit organizations which offer safe environments and mentorship programs to the youth. In 2016, Ms. Martinez established the first Suffolk County Child Care Commission, dedicated to equipping parents, educators and elected officials with information on the importance of early learning during the first 0-5 years.

Monica’s devotion to educational initiatives can be exemplified by her efforts in securing a $125K grant to create a STEM research program where seven students from Brentwood and Central Islip High School have been recognized as semi-finalists in the Siemens Competition.

Monica remained committed to enhancing the areas she represented through various legislative actions such as opening two resource centers, sponsoring and co-sponsoring resolutions for women, wage equality, expanding legislation to protect the rights of individuals affected by sexual harassment, banning smoking in multi-dwelling apartment complexes, strengthening county animal laws, and barring contractors in Suffolk County if found guilty of illegal toxic dumping. Ms. Martinez was appointed Chairwoman to the Public Safety Committee at the Suffolk County Legislature for the 2018-2020 Legislative term. Ms. Martinez was committed to eradicating the opioid epidemic through collaboration with local law enforcement officials to reduce the widespread use of heroin and prescription medication abuse in Suffolk County.

Monica’s legislative accomplishments prompted her to seek higher office by running for the New York State Senate in 2018, successfully winning and making history as the first woman and woman of color to represent the Third Senatorial District respectively and the first Salvadoran woman elected in the state of New York.

In her first term as Senator, Ms. Martinez supported legislation to make Long Island a more affordable place to live by making the 2% Property Tax Cap permanent which will save the average Suffolk County homeowner roughly $60,000 over the next ten years. She has fought for and secured record funding for our schools ensuring Long Islanders get their fair share from Albany.  She has supported common sense gun-safety measures, authored legislation protecting and expanding a woman's right to quality health care, advocated for and restored funding to programs that support our seniors, veterans and their families as well as co-sponsored one of the most progressive pieces of Climate Change legislation in the country. For years, she has fought to ensure our communities are safe by working with local law enforcement officials and providing them with the tools they need.  

In 2021, Ms. Martinez ran for newly drawn Fourth Senatorial District and successfully won and returned to Albany to continue the work of and for the people.  Senator Martinez serves as the Chair of Local Government where her role is to listen to the priorities of the state’s local governments and municipalities as well as passing meaningful legislation to help local governments and the people they serve. Senator Martinez is a member of a number of committees, including the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus, Women’s Legislative Caucus, Education, Insurance, Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, Elections, Environmental Conservation, Racing, Gaming, Wagering and is Co-Chair of the New York Legislative Aviation Caucus.

Senator Martinez remains committed to her work in assisting constituents and implementing beneficial policies for all New York State residents.
