A decorated military veteran and law enforcement official who has dedicated his life to serving his town and his country, Patrick Chludzinski was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 5, 2024. The 143rd District includes the Erie County towns of Cheektowaga and Lancaster, the villages of Depew and Sloan, and portions of the Ellicott, Fillmore, and Lovejoy Districts in the City of Buffalo.

Pat joined the Cheektowaga Police Department in 1999 as a Patrolman, and through his work ethic, dedication, and professionalism, has steadily risen through the ranks over the last 25 years. He became a Patrol Sergeant in 2008, was promoted to Lieutenant in 2013, and accepted his last assignment as Detective Lieutenant of the Youth and Family Offense Unit in 2022. Pat was especially proud of being named Commander of the Cheektowaga Police Honor Guard Unit in 2014, a post he held until his election to the Assembly.

Pat’s commitment to excellence was evident in his successful completion of 26 law enforcement training courses over his career. His exceptional service to the residents of Cheektowaga has been recognized with numerous Letters of Commendation and six Distinguished Conduct Awards, two of which were presented for his apprehension of armed robbers.

Pat is a veteran of the United States Army and served in the Army National Guard. After the devastating attacks of September 11, Pat was activated and assisted in the search and rescue efforts at the World Trade Center. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Pat served as a machine gunner in Baghdad conducting counter-insurgency and high-value target search missions, as well as serving with a quick response force to suppress enemy activity. His service has been recognized with two Army Commendation Medals with Combat Valor Device, a National Defense Service Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, an Armed Forces Reserve Medal, and a Combat Service Badge.

Public safety and public service have been Pat Chludzinski’s passions, and they have informed his views on the importance of state government in the day-to-day lives of his constituents. Intimately aware of the challenges and needs of the residents of the 143rd Assembly District, Pat is uniquely qualified to serve in the State Assembly and committed to making New York State a safer and more affordable place to live, work, and raise our families.

Prior to joining the Cheektowaga Police Department, Pat received an associate degree in Science Humanities from Erie Community College and studied Psychology and Criminal Justice at Buffalo State College. Pat and his wife, Tanya, are the proud parents of three daughters, Ava (16), Kendra (14), and Reyha (8).
