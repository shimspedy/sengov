Christopher "Chris" Tague is an American politician, farmer, and businessman from the state of New York. A Republican, Tague has represented the 102nd district of the New York State Assembly, covering parts of the Hudson Valley, since 2018.

After graduating from high school in 1987, Tague ran a dairy business, selling it in 1992. From 1992 until 2017, Tague worked at Cobleskill Stone Products, eventually becoming the company's general manager. He also served as Schoharie Town Supervisor between 2016 and 2018.

In April 2018, upon the resignation of Republican Assemblyman Pete Lopez to become a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, a special election was held in the Assembly's 102nd district. After a closely fought campaign, Tague defeated Democrat Aidan O'Connor 46-44%, with Reform Party candidate Wesley Laraway taking the remainder.

Both Tague and O'Connor ran for a full term that following November. In a much higher turnout election, Tague defeated O'Connor by a wide margin, 56-44%.

Tague was born and raised in Schoharie, New York, along with 2 siblings. He continues to live in Schoharie. He attended Schoharie Central School, graduating in 1987. He also played seasonal sports, was involved in the Key Club, was Student Council President, and a member of the Future Farmers of America.

After graduation, Chris started his own successful dairy farm business in 1987, growing from 25 cows to 75 cows, before selling the business in 1992. Soon thereafter, Chris joined Cobleskill Stone Products and he fell in love with the hard work of the laborer position. He was quickly promoted to foreman, then again promoted to supervise the maintenance shops and trucking division. He earned the title of Superintendent of the quarry, overseeing the entire operation until becoming promoted to General Manager. He was then responsible for company-wide health and safety compliance, environmental compliance, government affairs, education, and community outreach. Chris left his 25-year career at Cobleskill Stone Products in 2018 to work for us as our full-time Assemblyman and fight for our values in Albany.
