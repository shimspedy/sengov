Steve Chan is a Republican member of the New York State Senate, representing the 17th district. He assumed office on January 1, 2025, and his current term is set to end on December 31, 2026.

Born in Hong Kong, Steve Chan immigrated to the United States at the age of 11, settling in Brooklyn, New York. Growing up in the culturally rich neighborhood of Bay Ridge, he was surrounded by diverse communities that shaped his perspective on public service. Chan's early life was marked by hard work, as he took on various jobs, including working in a sweatshop and a plastic factory, before graduating high school.

Chan proudly served as a U.S. Marine for six years, an experience that instilled in him a deep sense of duty and patriotism. After his military service, he joined the New York Police Department in 1993, dedicating 27 years to fighting crime and building relationships within the community. He retired as a sergeant in 2020, leaving behind a legacy of commitment and integrity.

In addition to his career in law enforcement, Chan was a small business owner, operating a retail florist in Sunset Park for a decade. His entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to community service extended to providing free notary services to his neighbors. A strong advocate for education, Chan has been actively involved in public schools as a parent leader, serving as an SLT Parent, Title 1 Chairperson, and PTA president.

Chan's journey to the New York State Senate was driven by his desire to preserve the values of his community and address pressing issues such as crime, education, and fiscal responsibility. As a senator, he aims to ensure that children receive unbiased education, reduce wasteful government spending, and create a better environment for families and businesses in his district.

A devoted family man, Chan is married with two daughters who attend public schools. He believes in the American Dream and has instilled in his children the values of hard work, personal responsibility, and respect for others. Chan's life story is a testament to his belief that with dedication and perseverance, anyone can achieve their dreams in the United States.
