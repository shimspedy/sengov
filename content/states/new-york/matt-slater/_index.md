Matt Slater is an American politician who was elected to represent New York State�s 94th Assembly District in November 2022. The 94th Assembly District includes parts of Putnam and Westchester counties, including the towns of Kent, Patterson, Putnam Valley, Carmel, Southeast, Somers, and Yorktown, as well as the village of Brewster.

Born and raised in Yorktown, Matt is a graduate of Yorktown High School. He furthered his education at St. Anselm College, where he received his bachelor's degree in 2008, and Marist College, where he received his Master's in Public Administration in 2010.

Before joining the New York State Assembly, Matt served as the Town Supervisor for Yorktown. He was first elected to this position in 2019 and was reelected in 2021. As Town Supervisor, Matt balanced Yorktown�s budget through spending cuts and economic growth. He managed to cut town taxes for the first time in three decades. His economic development plan was hailed as a model for the rest of the state by the Business Council of Westchester County. This plan helped attract major investments by Trader Joe�s, Uncle Giuseppe�s, and several other transformative projects throughout Yorktown�s five hamlets.

Prior to his election as Yorktown Town Supervisor, Matt served as Chief of Staff to former state Sen. Terrence Murphy for four years. In that role, he partnered with Sen. Murphy to enact dozens of local and statewide laws. He secured millions of dollars in state funding for area projects and led local relief efforts for the victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Maria. Matt played an integral role in the state Senate�s Task Force on Heroin and Opioid Abuse, helping to write a new law limiting opioid prescriptions to combat the region�s heroin epidemic and provide $45,000 to combat the drug crisis in our region.

In 2022, Matt received a Presidential Direct Commission as an officer in the United States Navy Reserves and is currently assigned to Navy Cargo Handling Battalion 8 based in Lakehurst, NJ.

Matt is committed to making his state, his community, and his Assembly District a better place to live, work, and raise a family. He currently resides in Yorktown with his wife and two children.
