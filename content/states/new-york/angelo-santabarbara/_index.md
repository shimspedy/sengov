Angelo Santabarbara PE, is a source of inspiration for his family, friends and colleagues, as he is deeply committed to enhancing the well-being of his community. Angelo's upbringing was rooted in the values of hard work and determination as the son of immigrant parents who believed that success would follow diligent effort. He was born in the city of Schenectady and lives in the town of Rotterdam with his wife, Jennifer, where they are nurturing their two children, Michael and Marianna.

Angelo's educational journey took him through public schools and furthering his academic pursuits. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from SUNY Albany to become a licensed professional engineer. Angelo assumed the role of President of the Capital District Chapter New York State Society of Professional Engineers and contributed to various boards, including the Autism Society of the Greater Capital Region, Family and Child Service of Schenectady and Cornell Cooperative Extension in Schenectady County.

Angelo's commitment to serving his country and community is evident through his eight years of honorable service in the United States Army Reserve. He remains actively engaged with local veterans' service organizations and proudly founded the first AMVETS Post in his hometown of Rotterdam, where he served as post commander.

When his son Michael was born, he was diagnosed with autism. This life-altering event prompted Angelo to transition from his more than 15-year career as a civil engineer to embark on a path of public service and advocacy for people with disabilities.

In 2007, Angelo Santabarbara was elected to the Schenectady County Legislature, where he held the responsibilities of Chairman of the Transportation Committee and Vice Chairman of the Veterans Committee. He devoted five years to public service as a Schenectady County Legislator before achieving a significant milestone in his career. In 2012, he was elected to the New York State Assembly, making history as the first representative of the newly created 111th District, which includes areas of Montgomery County and Schenectady County. As a member of the New York State Assembly, Angelo assumes key leadership roles, including Chairman of the Libraries and Education Technology Committee and memberships on various committees, including Energy, Governmental Employees, Mental Health and Racing & Wagering Committees. His unwavering dedication to public service and passion for being a voice for people with disabilities continues to make a positive impact on his community and beyond.
