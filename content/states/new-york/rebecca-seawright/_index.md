Rebecca Seawright is a prominent member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 76th District. She assumed office on January 1, 2015. The district she represents includes portions of the Upper East Side, Roosevelt Island, and Yorkville in Manhattan.

Born on April 24, 1962, in Texas, Seawright is affiliated with the Democratic Party. She is known for her strong voice for over 133,000 constituents and has secured over $17 million in funding for public schools, senior centers, parks, and non-profits.

Before her political career, Seawright served as the New York State Director of the National Women's Political Caucus and a staffer in the New York State Assembly. She also worked in Washington, D.C., including for United States Representative Lloyd Bentsen.

In 2014, Assemblyman Micah Kellner decided not to seek re-election, and Seawright entered the race to succeed him. She defeated three other candidates to receive the Democratic nomination. Seawright would go on to win the general election with nearly 67% of the vote.

Seawright was sworn into office on January 1, 2015. She is a member of the Banking, Consumer Affairs and Protection, Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, Judiciary, and Tourism, Parks, Arts, and Sports Development Committees. She is the Chair of the Subcommittee on Consumer Fraud Protection and also sits on the Assembly's Work group on operations. She is a member of the Legislative Women's Caucus and Bipartisan Pro-Choice Legislative Caucus.

In August 2020, Seawright's electoral office was vandalized with paint and an anti-Semitic note. The incident led to a collaboration with Speaker of the New York State Assembly Carl Heastie to create the Museum of Tolerance in New York City.

Seawright is a leading advocate for affordable housing and landmark housing reform laws to abolish vacancy decontrol and restrict rent hikes. A proponent of strong democratic values, Rebecca strongly supports reforms to run elections efficiently, accurately, and with integrity to protect our voting rights.
