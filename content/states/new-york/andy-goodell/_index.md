He received the Business First “40-under-40” award in 1993 for being one of the top 40 leaders under the age of 40 in Western New York.

Andy has been repeatedly recognized by the New York Farm Bureau as part of its “Circle of Friends” for his tireless support of agricultural legislation and programs. He also consistently receives one of the highest rankings of any Assembly Member by the Business Council of New York State, Inc. and other business organizations. In 2014, he received the “Disability Advocate of the Year” award from The Resource Center, recognizing his legislative advocacy on behalf of those with disabilities. Previously, he received recognition awards for establishing the Fire Service Enhancement Program and the Chautauqua Child Care Council. In 1996, he was a recipient of the highest award from the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC) for his welfare and Medicaid reform work, and was appointed by former Governor George E. Pataki to serve on a State task force to restructure employment, health, and social services.
