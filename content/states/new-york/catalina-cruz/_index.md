Catalina Cruz is a Colombian-American attorney from the borough of Queens in New York City. She is a member of the Democratic Party and a former undocumented immigrant minor (DREAMer). Cruz has worked as an advocate for immigration rights, including as Director of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's 2016 Exploited Task Force.

Cruz was born in Medellï¿½n, Colombia. In 1992, when she was nine years old, Cruz and her mother came to the United States under a six-month tourist visa. They remained in the U.S. and she was undocumented for over 10 years after her initial tourist visa expired. Cruz grew up in Brooklyn and Queens. She has five siblings, three of whom are U.S. citizens. Cruz became the first former undocumented immigrant who identifies as a DREAMer to be elected in New York state. She is also the first Colombian-American in the district, and only the third DREAMer to serve in an elected position in the United States.

In 2001, Cruz graduated from John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens. In 2005, Cruz received a bachelor's degree with honors in forensic psychology from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In 2009, Cruz received a J.D. from the City University of New York School of Law.

After law school, Cruz worked as a Volunteer Assistant Attorney General for the New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo, where her case work included focusing on fraud related to immigration services and working on prosecution efforts. From 2009 to 2012, Cruz was counsel at the Goddard Riverside SRO Law Project at the Goddard Riverside Community Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. From 2012 to 2014, Cruz was counsel to the Division of Immigrant Policies and Affairs at the New York State Department of Labor. In 2014, Cruz was counsel to the Immigration Committee for the New York City Council, where she worked to improve coverage of issue related to domestic worker trafficking. She worked on the Unaccompanied Minors Initiative and the IDNYC program. She also oversaw the Key to the City program.

Cruz was elected as the Democratic candidate in the Fall 2018 election for the 39th district of the New York State Assembly, representing Corona, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights, Queens.
