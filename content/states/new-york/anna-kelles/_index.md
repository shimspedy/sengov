Anna Kelles, born on April 11, 1974, is an American Democratic politician who currently represents the 125th district of the New York State Assembly. This district includes Tompkins County and parts of Cortland County, encompassing the metropolitan areas of Ithaca and Cortland as well as 17 smaller municipal towns and villages in both counties.

Kelles spent her childhood in Trumansburg, New York. She earned a bachelor's degree in biology and environmental studies from Binghamton University in 1997. Between her degrees, she worked in Ecuador as a high school biology teacher and Amazon basin ecological guide. In 2008, she earned a Ph.D. in nutritional epidemiology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

After earning her Ph.D., she taught nutritional science at Ithaca College and Cornell University before starting a private practice in nutrition and wellness. She also served as the Administration Manager for the Certifying Examination for Nutrition Specialists and Chair of the Examination Development Council of the Board of the Certification for Nutrition Specialists (BCNS) for 8 years prior to running for the State Assembly.

Before becoming a state Assembly member, Anna served in the Tompkins County Legislature from 2015 to 2020. She served as chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, the Planning, Development and Environmental Quality Committee, and, for the last several years, as the chair of the Housing and Economic Development Committee.

In her tenure on the County Legislature, Anna crafted legislation and effectively championed many public health issues, including access to affordable housing in walkable communities, immigrants’ rights, expanded use of alternatives to incarceration, restricting youth access to tobacco and funding to end homelessness, expand rural broadband access and support child care initiatives.

She also authored environmental legislation, such as an initiative to block state permitting of a proposed trash incinerator on the shore of Cayuga Lake. She served on the Community Housing Development Fund board, the Downtown Ithaca Alliance, the Strategic Tourism Planning Board, Ithaca Area Economic Development and Southern Tier 8, a regional economic development council.

Kelles was elected November 12, 2020, defeating Libertarian Matthew McIntyre in the general election race to represent New York Assembly District 125. Kelles considers herself a progressive democrat. Her platform includes universal health care, racial justice, economic recovery, universal child care, universal housing, criminal justice reform, and food security. She also supports mandatory vaccination, having campaigned in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Kelles visited the Auburn Correctional Facility in February 2021 in order to "bear witness" to conditions at the prison, one of the oldest in the United States. She criticized the small cells and the mental health implications of extended solitary confinement. She and other legislators advocated for the Justice Roadmap, which includes measures to reform solitary confinement and ensure fair and timely parole. She joined several advocacy groups in this position, including New York Communities for Change.

Kelles was among a number of New York State politicians to criticize Governor Andrew Cuomo after allegations were published that he had sexually harassed several women, first calling for him to resign if found guilty by an investigation led by State Attorney General Letitia James, then calling for him to resign immediately, signing on to a letter along with 58 other Democrats in statewide elected offices. She and others also criticized Cuomo for the New York COVID-19 nursing home scandal, as it had been found that data on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes had been altered.

Kelles is proposing a Earned Time act to shorten sentences for good behavior of prisoners and a Save Journalism Act to combat monopoly practices and to promote local media and newspapers across New York.
