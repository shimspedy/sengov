Steven D. Rhoads is an American politician who currently represents New York's 5th State Senate district in the New York State Senate. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Rhoads was elected to the State Senate in 2022. His election was a significant event as he defeated the incumbent Democrat John Brooks, who was redistricted from the 8th district. This victory marked a shift in the political landscape of the district.

Before his political career, Rhoads was a firefighter and an attorney for first responders. His commitment to public safety has been a cornerstone of his career, with over 30 years of service as a volunteer firefighter. This experience has deeply influenced his legislative priorities.

As a senator, one of Rhoads' main priorities has been to fight against dangerous bail laws that free killers, gang members, drug dealers, and other violent felons from jail. His advocacy in this area stems from his background in public safety and his commitment to the wellbeing of his constituents.

Rhoads resides in Bellmore, New York. His connection to his community is evident in his dedication to public service, both as a firefighter and as a senator. His work continues to impact the lives of the people in his district and the state of New York.
