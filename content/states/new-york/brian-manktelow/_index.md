Brian Manktelow is an American politician and farmer from the state of New York. A Republican, Manktelow has represented the 130th district of the New York State Assembly, based in Wayne County along Lake Ontario, since 2019.

After graduating high school, Manktelow served in the U.S. Army, achieving the rank of sergeant. When he returned, Manktelow took classes at the University of Chicago and Finger Lakes Community College, but did not attain degrees from either. Manktelow has also been the owner and operator of Manktelow Farms for 30 years.

In 2009, Manktelow was elected Lyons Town Supervisor, a position he held until 2018. Manktelow ran in 2016 for New York's 54th State Senate district, vacated by retiring Republican Michael F. Nozzolio. He came in third in the primary, behind Floyd Rayburn and eventual winner Pam Helming.

After longtime State Assemblyman Bob Oaks announced his retirement in 2018, Manktelow launched his campaign for the 130th Assembly district. He won the primary uncontested, and defeated Democrat Scott Comegys in the general election with 67% of the vote.

Manktelow lives in Lyons with his wife, Crystal, and their five children. As supervisor of the Town of Lyons, he worked to protect the interests of his fellow residents during the dissolution of the village of Lyons in 2015, ensuring a positive impact on the municipality’s future. Now, Brian is determined to bring his breadth of experience in the military and civilian life to serve his neighbors and community, fighting the opioid crisis, lowering taxes, improving veteran services, and ensuring the American Dream and upstate values continue to thrive in Albany.
