Judy Griffin was elected to serve the 21st Assembly District on November 5, 2024. Judy previously served in the NYS Assembly for two terms from 2019-2022. She was the first woman elected to represent the district, and the first majority member elected to represent AD21 since 1974. Her victory in 2018 was her first run for public office.

As an Assemblywoman, Judy was a strong suburban voice committed to public safety, public education, protecting the environment and a champion of labor unions, law enforcement, and a woman’s right to choose. Through determination and persistence, Judy demonstrated a steadfast ability to advocate, lead and deliver effectively for her district. After building consensus on key issues, she passed gun safety legislation, protected women's rights, fought for safe staffing and prevailing wage, capped property taxes, secured record school funding while also providing first-time funding for Universal Pre-K in suburban schools, advocated for increased mental health services and brought resources and strategies to address the opioid epidemic. Her first bill passed and signed into law banned schools from arming teachers. She successfully secured over $8 million to fund police and volunteer fire departments, municipalities, schools, libraries, veteran organizations, and valued non-profit organizations in her Assembly District and in Nassau County.

In her first two terms Judy was Chair of the Commission on Toxic Substances and Hazardous Wastes and a member of the following Committees: Alcoholism and Drug Abuse; Economic Development, Job Creation, Commerce and Industry; Environmental Conservation; Governmental Employees; and Higher Education. She also was a member of the Legislative Women’s Caucus and Taskforce on Women’s Issues.

Judy is grateful to bring a fresh perspective, centrist voice and tenacious approach back to the Assembly majority to deliver real results for the district while advocating for a cleaner, safer, kinder and more affordable Long Island and New York State. She will continue to fight for essential services for seniors, veterans, and our most vulnerable residents as well as our fair share of funding and focus on helping residents build a path to prosperity, decreasing taxes and bringing resources to revitalize communities and help small businesses thrive.

Judy’s top priorities for AD21 are equitable school funding, safer neighborhoods, strengthening the local economy, protecting our environment, inclusivity, equal justice and equal rights.

She aims to: fight for a Foundation Aid Formula that reflects the changing demographics and vital needs of Long Island; pass the Peer support program for police; advocate for increased investment in infrastructure on Long Island to strengthen our local economy; increase vital state aid to our municipalities and schools; stand up for women’s rights, the hard-working men and women of labor and our police officers; advocate for a comprehensive approach to address mental health and the opioid epidemic; prioritize public safety, strengthen gun safety measures and focus on supporting victims of crimes; build upon previously passed legislation to establish the Nassau County South Shore Water Authority to improve quality, lower cost and enhance service; make our waterways pristine, address coastal flooding and increase coastline resiliency; advocate for workforce development, vocational training and pre-apprenticeship programs in high school and beyond; reestablish excellent constituent service and effective outreach.

Judy was born and raised on Long Island and has been married to her husband, Mike, for 35 years. They have resided in Rockville Centre for over 30 years, where they raised four children, welcomed two sons-in-law, and have a beautiful 3-year-old granddaughter.

Judy is a graduate of SUNY Oneonta, where she earned her degree in Business Economics and Political Science, then began her career in the financial industry. She later attended the Institute for Integrative Nutrition and became an Integrative Health Coach, founded businesses related to health and corporate wellness, and authored a book entitled Flourish Beyond 50. Judy then served as Director of Community Outreach and Senior Advisor to State Senator Todd Kaminsky.

Judy’s commitment to the community is reflected in her years of civic engagement, volunteerism and advocacy where she served as the President of the Rockville Centre Newcomers Club, as a Brownie and Girl Scout Leader, member of the RVC Mercy League, an educational advocate chairing numerous PTA and school district committees, and worked in solidarity with grassroots leaders in the "Opt-Out" movement to eliminate standardized testing practices. She was thrilled to sponsor and pass legislation which delinked teacher evaluations from standardized test scores.
