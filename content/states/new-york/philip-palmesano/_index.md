Philip A. Palmesano is an American politician and a member of the New York State Assembly. He was born on April 25, 1969, in Hornell, New York. He graduated from Hornell High School in 1987 and earned a bachelor's degree in political science from St. Bonaventure University in 1991.

After college, Palmesano worked as an aide to several federal and state lawmakers, including former State Assembly members Donald Davidsen and Jim Bacalles, who both represented parts of the district that Palmesano now represents. He also worked as the district director for former Congressman Randy Kuhl before joining the staff of former State Senator George Winner.

In 2009, Palmesano was elected to represent the city of Corning in the Steuben County Legislature. He served on the Agriculture, Industry and Planning Committee, and the Human Services, Health and Education Committees. In 2010, he was elected to the State Assembly as a Republican, defeating Independent democrat Jason Jordon.

Palmesano represents the 132nd Assembly District which includes parts of Steuben, Seneca and Chemung counties and all of Schuyler and Yates counties. He was appointed Assistant Minority Leader in 2020 and currently serves on multiple committees in the state Assembly. He serves as the Ranking Minority Member on the Energy Committee. He also serves on the Rules, Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, Correction, Insurance, and Ways and Means committees.

His top priorities include improving the state's business climate, advocating for tax, regulatory, and unfunded mandate relief, investing in local infrastructure, promoting organ and tissue donation, and standing up for our most vulnerable New Yorkers, the developmentally disabled.

Philip Palmesano resides in Corning with his wife, Laura, and their two children.
