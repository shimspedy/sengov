She currently serves on the following committees: Higher Education, Economic Development, Rules, and Transportation.

Her other leadership positions include Chair of the Legislative Women's Caucus, Co-Chair of the New York Legislative Aviation Caucus, and Past-President of the New York Conference of Italian-American State Legislators.
