Prior to joining the New York State Assembly, Dr. Marianne Buttenschon was the Dean of Public Service and Emergency Preparedness at Mohawk Valley Community College. Her 2018 campaign for the Assembly was her first attempt at elected office. Marianne is married to Don Buttenschon, a retired public-school psychologist. They have three grown children and six grandchildren.

For over 30 years, Don and Marianne have operated the Buttenschon Christmas Tree Farm in the Town of Marcy in Oneida County. Marianne is a career-long educator and a lifelong learner. She earned an AAS from Mohawk Valley Community College, a BA in Public Justice from SUNY (IT) Polytechnic Institute, an MA in Public Policy from Binghamton University and a Doctorate of Education from Northeastern.

The Assemblywoman knows the value of hard work intimately; even in her spare moments, you'll find her tending to her beloved farm and cherishing moments with her family and grandchildren. Her dedication is unwavering, and her presence is felt in every aspect of her life.

She is grateful for her education for equipping her with the skills to help others. Her priorities include protecting and educating the people of the Mohawk Valley, which is dear to her heart, as well as bringing good jobs to the area. Marianne’s objectives as a public servant are reflected in her high level of civic and professional engagement. Assemblywoman Buttenschon proudly serves as a member on the NYS Assembly Agriculture, Banks, Economic Development, Education, Higher Education and Veterans Affairs committees. In addition, she is the chair of the Committee on Export Trade. Apart from her committee membership, she is also a dedicated member of the Legislative Women’s caucus, the Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force, Asian Pacific American Task Force and the Task Force on Women’s Issues. Recently, she attended a convention in Puerto Rico to see firsthand the need and value of Puerto Rico to New York State and the United States.

Through her membership on Assembly committees, Assemblywoman Buttenschon works every day to enhance her communities’ development, education, and public safety along with ensuring food is distributed to those in need through local food pantries. Her community service includes serving as Vice President of the Utica Community Food Pantry and as member of the League of Women Voters, International Association of Chiefs of Police, the New York State Association of Fire Chiefs and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. Based upon her long commitment to public safety and the improvement of New York State’s first response capability, Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie chose Marianne to be the Assembly’s representative on the Interoperable and Emergency Communications Board. Marianne values transparency, accountability and fairness, believing every citizen has the right to be heard and to know how their government functions.

Marianne represents one of the most economically and demographically diverse districts in Upstate New York. The growing City of Rome, with Griffiss Business and Technology Park and Griffiss International Airport, holds great promise for the development of drone technologies and other cutting-edge manufacturing. The City of Utica is a city on the upswing due to its local officials and a growing refugee and immigrant population. Utica has always been a welcoming immigrant city starting in the late 1880s. Agriculture remains a constant, indispensable driver of the local economy.

The 119th AD is currently comprised of the cities of Utica and Rome as well as the suburban and farming communities of Floyd, Marcy, Whitestown and Deerfield. She is proud of her area and her contribution to its growth and future through her efforts as an Assemblywoman.
