Daniel George Stec, born on February 21, 1969, is an American politician currently serving as a member of the New York State Senate for the 45th district. He represents all of Clinton, Essex, Franklin, and Warren Counties, and parts of St. Lawrence County and Washington County. Before this, he represented the 114th district of the New York State Assembly.

Stec was born to George, a Vietnam War veteran and New York State Forest Ranger, and Elsie, a school secretary. He was raised in Queensbury, New York and graduated from Queensbury High School in 1987. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York.

In 2011, Stec became the chairman of the Warren County Board of Supervisors. He was elected to the New York State Assembly in 2012, serving until 2020. He was elected to the New York State Senate in 2020, defeating Clinton County Treasurer Kimberly Davis.

Stec is a North Country native, Navy veteran and Adirondack 46er. After graduating from Clarkson University with a BS in Chemical Engineering, Dan served our nation for eight years in the U.S. Navy’s nuclear power program. After leaving the Navy, Dan returned home to Queensbury and ran for town council. He was then elected Town Supervisor for five terms and chairman of the Warren County Board of Supervisors for two terms.

On November 3, 2020, Dan was elected State Senator. Dan is now putting his passion for public service to work for our families and businesses by fighting for better broadband and cell service, supporting our upstate schools and hospitals and proposing initiatives to help our economy recover from the pandemic. He's also been a strong voice for public safety reforms, calling for a full repeal of bail reform and working with our corrections officers to advocate for a repeal of the HALT Act.

Dan is the Ranking Minority Senator on the Environmental Conservation and Internet and Technology Committees. He also serves on the Senate's Education, Health, Rules, State-Native American Relations and Veterans, Homeland Security and Military Affairs Committees. He uses his voice on these important committees to advocate for our communities' needs.
