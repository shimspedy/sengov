Manny De Los Santos is a dedicated public servant who has devoted his life to advocating and fighting for New Yorkers. He was raised in Northern Manhattan, attended public schools and earned a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology and a Master's Degree in Social Work from the University at Albany (SUNY).

After graduating, Manny embarked on a 13-year career as a Social Worker and Community School Director in New York City public schools. During this time, he helped students overcome academic challenges, homelessness, and substance abuse by advocating for and securing vital resources for families and students that were in need.

Manny's dedication to his community did not stop there. He is actively involved in several community organizations, including as a member of the Neighborhood Advisory Board (NAB) and Community Board 12. He has prioritized voter engagement and education as tools to empower the lives of residents in Northern Manhattan. He has coordinated voter registration and census drives, facilitated tenant, housing, and immigration forums, as well as organized annual turkey giveaways, coat drives, toy drives, and backpack giveaways in conjunction with tenant associations and dozens of minority-owned small businesses.

As an Assembly Member, he has worked to provide record funding for public schools and was proud to see the passage of his legislation to reduce class sizes throughout the state.

Manny believes that every voice in the community deserves to be heard. He and his constituent service team have worked with thousands of residents on issues impacting District 72. In addition to working with residents to resolve government related concerns, his office also takes a proactive approach of working with constituents to tackle more long-term issues – including, spearheading networking events for young professionals, which aim to open doors for those that all too often don’t have a seat at the table.

Manny is committed to ensuring that we have more funding for public schools, promoting public safety, creating more affordable housing options for working New Yorkers, and ending our reliance on fossil fuels to protect our natural environment and our health. These are issues that Manny has been passionate about for a long time, and he is determined to make a positive impact on them during his time in the Assembly.

Manny's story is one of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. He is committed to continuing to work with the community to make the city a better place for everyone. He believes that by working together, we can make a real difference for our community and the people that call it home.
