Pamela J. Hunter is a distinguished member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 128th District. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district she represents includes portions of Syracuse, as well as the surrounding towns of Salina, DeWitt, and Onondaga.

Born on November 4, 1969, in New York, New York, Hunter was raised in upstate New York. She has a commendable military background, having served in the United States Army. For her service, she was honorably discharged with a commendation medal and two achievement medals.

Over the years, Hunter has been significantly involved in a number of Syracuse-based charities, including the Syracuse Community Health Center, Home Aides of CNY, and Catholic Charities. Her commitment to public service extends beyond her military career and charitable work.

In 2013, Hunter made her first foray into politics, running for and winning an At-Large seat on the Syracuse Common Council. During her tenure, she served as the Chair of the Public Safety Committee.

Her journey to the New York State Assembly began in 2015 when Assemblyman Samuel D. Roberts resigned to take a position with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. A special election was called for his seat, and Hunter announced that she would pursue the seat. In a three-way primary, she won the seat and went on to win the three-way general election with a plurality. Hunter was sworn into the seat on November 4, 2015.

Hunter's dedication to her constituents and her commitment to public service continue to guide her work in the New York State Assembly. Her leadership and experience make her a valued member of the Assembly and a strong advocate for the people of the 128th District.
