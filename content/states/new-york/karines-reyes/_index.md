Karines Reyes is a member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 87th district. She has been a Bronxite for nearly 20 years. Born in the neighborhood of Los Minas, Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic, she identifies as an Afro-Latina.

Karines is a registered nurse in the Oncology Department at Montefiore Einstein Hospital. She has two young sons and has been balancing the tasks of being a nurse, union representative, activist and volunteer without neglecting the duties of her most important job � being a mother.

Her family left the Dominican Republic and moved to her father�s homeland of Carolina, Puerto Rico, in her early childhood. She immigrated to the United States with her mother when she was 6 years old. Moving to Corona, Queens, to live with her maternal grandfather, she experienced the culture shock of a place that was different and unknown. The challenge of learning English made her apprehensive, but Karines dove right in and excelled in all areas of her education.

Her love for the arts and music continued to develop as she moved throughout the public school system. At Louis Armstrong Middle school in Queens, she played the clarinet in the concert band and was senior band leader. During her years at the High School of Art and Design, Karines focused on visual arts � creating an array of inspiring works of art. She majored in advertising and served as the account executive for the student-run advertising agency.

After graduating with honors, Karines attended CUNY Baruch College and studied communications. During that time, she began working at Mount Sinai Hospital in the Health Information Management Department. Three years later, she had her first son. The financial demands of raising a family pushed Karines to work a second job. She obtained a position with Aramark at Mount Sinai Hospital and worked as a hospital employee and an outside contractor simultaneously.

Soon after, she moved to the Physical Therapy Department as an admissions coordinator when her second son was born in 2010. While on maternity leave, she decided to return to school and pursue a career in nursing. As a student nurse, Karines volunteered in Haiti after the earthquake and participated in numerous community health fairs in the Bronx.

She acquired her degree in nursing by 2013 � while working full time and managing the demands of being a mother. She graduated with the third-highest nursing average in her class and passed the boards. Shortly after, she began her nursing career at Montefiore Hospital on the In-Patient Oncology Ward.

Karines attained a certification in chemotherapy infusion and worked in the hospital and as an infusion nurse at the Eastchester Cancer Center. She was an active leader and served on the NYSNA Executive Committee at Einstein Hospital as vice chair of the bargaining unit. Additionally, she has participated in lobbying for safer nurse-to-patient ratios and single-payer health care in New York State.
