Elizabeth Krueger, commonly known as Liz Krueger, was born on November 20, 1957, in New York City to Harvey M. Krueger and Constance Krueger. She has two sisters, Abigail and Cathleen. Her brother, Peter, tragically died of AIDS in 1988. Her father was the CEO of the investment bank Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and served as vice chairman of Lehman Brothers following the merger with Kuhn, Loeb & Co. in 1977.

Liz Krueger is a member of the New York State Senate, representing District 28 on the East Side of Manhattan. She was first elected in a special election in February 2002 and is a Democrat. She has made reforming and modernizing New York State’s government, political process, and tax policy the central goals of her legislative agenda. She is one of New York’s most recognized advocates for transformative good-government reforms, from overhauling our outdated, inadequate campaign finance laws to transforming the opaque state budget process.

Senator Krueger is also a strong advocate for tenants’ rights, affordable housing, improved access to health care and prescription drug coverage, social services, more equitable funding for public education – including higher education – and animal welfare. In 2011 Senator Krueger formed the New York State Bipartisan Pro-Choice Legislative Caucus, a group of more than 75 lawmakers which includes members of both political parties and representatives from both houses of the legislature.

Some of Senator Krueger’s other legislative initiatives include: a package of legislation promoting fairness for women in the workplace, such as measures to fight wage discrimination and a measure requiring reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees; a bill to support recycling and expand the bottle bill; a bill repealing the Urstadt Law and restoring local control over New York City housing policy; legislation that would expand access to the Senior Citizen’s Rent Increase Exemption; legislation establishing a breastfeeding bill of rights; and legislation expanding access to food stamps and safety net assistance for needy families and individuals. She was also lead sponsor of the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, which passed in 2021.

Senator Liz Krueger has dedicated her career to issues relating to poverty, and she is a nationally recognized expert on the problems of hunger and homelessness, and the lack of affordable housing, healthcare, and job training. Senator Krueger served as Chair of the New York City Food Stamp Task Force; Co-Facilitator of the New York City Welfare Reform Network; on the board of the City-Wide Task Force on Housing Court; and as a board member of the NYC Federal Emergency Management Agency Emergency Food and Shelter Program administered by the United Way of Greater New York.
