Jake Blumencranz was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 8, 2022. The 15th Assembly District includes portions of the towns of Hempstead, North Hempstead, and Oyster Bay.

Prior to being elected to the Assembly, Jake worked in the private sector as a business executive. He believes this experience will give him an advantage when connecting and advocating for his constituents.

Jake is committed to working with all legislators to create a more affordable and safe New York. His plans include tax breaks for homeowners, cutting income taxes for middle-class families, and eliminating waste within the state budget.

He previously worked for the Nassau County District Court and understands the intricacies of the criminal justice system. This knowledge will be invaluable when making the important decisions pertaining to keeping our communities safe.

In addition to fiscal responsibility and safety, Jake pledges to promote academic opportunities for all students, such as BOCES programs and trade schools, alongside a traditional academic pathway.

Jake earned his Master of Science in Regional Urban Planning and Economic Development at The London School of Economics and holds a dual Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Policy and Religious Studies from Rice University. He is currently a resident of Oyster Bay.
