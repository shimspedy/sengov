Jamaal T. Bailey, born on August 26, 1982, is an American attorney and politician. He is currently serving as a member of the New York State Senate from the 36th district. As a member of the Democratic Party, he represents portions of Baychester, Co-op City, Eastchester, Edenwald, Wakefield, Pelham Gardens, and Woodlawn Heights in the Bronx as well as Mount Vernon in Westchester County.

Bailey was born and raised in the Bronx, where he attended New York City Public Schools, including P.S. 83 in Morris Park and M.S 181 in Co-op City. He later attended the Bronx High School of Science. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University at Albany, SUNY and a Juris Doctor from the CUNY School of Law.

A protege of New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, Bailey began his political career as an intern in Heastie's office. In mid 2016, state Senator Ruth Hassell-Thompson resigned from her seat to take a position with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Bailey ran in the state primary to replace her. Against four other Democratic candidates, Bailey would win an outright majority of the vote with over 55%. Much of his success was attributed to both his roots in the district, as well as the strong support given by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who Bailey formerly worked for. Heastie's district covers a portion of the same area of the Bronx.

Bailey won a second term unopposed in 2018. With Democrats taking the majority in the Senate, Bailey became chair of the Senate Committee on Codes.

On a personal note, Bailey is married and has two daughters.
