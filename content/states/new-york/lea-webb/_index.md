Lea Webb is a distinguished member of the New York State Senate. She represents the 52nd Senate District and is known for her dedication and commitment to public service.

Born and raised in the Southern Tier region of New York, Webb pursued her education diligently. She earned an associate degree in liberal arts and sciences from SUNY Broome Community College. Her thirst for knowledge didn't stop there. She went on to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from Binghamton University. Later, she also earned a B.S. in Psychology from the same university.

Before her political career, Webb worked as an educator at Binghamton University. Her passion for community service and leadership was evident early on. She was appointed to serve as a council member for the City of Binghamton, New York. During her tenure, she addressed critical issues that families face. From removing blighted properties and supporting their redevelopment into homes for her community to addressing food desert issues by establishing community gardens, Webb has improved the lives of those she serves.

Webb's influence extends beyond her local community. She co-founded the Black Millennial Political Convention and was a founding board member of Local Progress. These platforms allowed her to advocate for change on a larger scale.

As a New York State Senator, Webb continues to champion women's issues. She serves as the Chair of the Women's Issues Committee. Her work in the Senate is a testament to her dedication to public service and her commitment to making a difference in the lives of the people she serves.
