Assemblymember Jaime Williams proudly began her first term serving the 59th Assembly District on April 19, 2016. This wonderful, diverse and eclectic district encompasses the neighborhoods of Canarsie, Georgetown, Mill Basin, Marine Park, Bergen Beach and Gerritsen Beach.

Originally from Trinidad and Tobago, she came to the United States and settled in New York City. After graduating from Kingsborough Community College, Jaime next earned her bachelor’s degree in social work at York College, followed by a master’s degree in social work from Fordham University. She then proudly returned to her alma mater, Kingsborough Community College, to successfully earn her CASAC-T certificate as an Alcohol and Substance Abuse Counselor with a specialization in gambling counseling. She has more than 8 years of experience counseling women and children victims of domestic violence along with clients who were HIV+ with a history of substance abuse. She is a past, member of the 69th Precinct Community Council, the Mill Basin Civic Association and Brooklyn's Community Board 18. Those experiences have allowed her to collaborate with faith-based community and civic organizations to promote domestic violence awareness and participate in countless food and toy drives for families in the community. She is currently an active member of the Canarsie Lions Club.

Following Superstorm Sandy, Assemblymember Williams worked with Catholic Charities helping residents in Canarsie, Bergen Beach, Gerritsen Beach and Coney Island. She also served as the Community Project Director for Brooklyn East at Catholic Charities, where she provided outreach programs for the community in Brownsville, East New York, Canarsie and Mill Basin. Through continued outreach, Jaime served as the liaison between Catholic Charities and local elected officials to address social service issues affecting Catholic Charities programs. Following storms and hurricanes in the Caribbean in 2017, Jaime led a humanitarian relief mission to aid several countries and territories in desperate need, dispensing much-needed medical supplies and food. Jaime and her team took home the lesson that disaster can strike at any moment and preparation is a must, so she then graduated from NYC’s CERT program, a volunteer program that prepares members of the community for emergencies by aiding police and fire departments during a crisis. That helped her to spearhead a mission to Kentucky following its devasting tornado in December 2021.

Assemblymember Williams continues to work hard for members of her local community and beyond.
