Jaime R. Williams was born on August 24, 1979, in Trinidad and Tobago. She immigrated to New York City in 1999 and has been a resident of Brooklyn ever since. She pursued her education at Fordham University, where she earned a master's degree in social work.

Before her political career, Williams worked in the community, including for domestic violence prevention. Following Hurricane Sandy, she worked for Catholic Social Services of Brooklyn and Queens to help with relief efforts. She joined the staff of Assemblywoman Roxanne Persaud following her election in 2014 as her Chief of Staff.

Williams is a member of the Democratic Party and represents the 59th district of the New York State Assembly. The district includes portions of Canarsie, Georgetown, Mill Basin, Marine Park, and Gerritsen Beach in Brooklyn.

Assemblywoman Roxanne Persaud was elected to the New York Senate in a special election in November 2015 following John Sampson losing his Senate seat due to a felony conviction. As a result, she resigned from the Assembly to take her seat in the Senate. Brooklyn Democrats soon after chose Williams to run in the special election to serve out the remainder of Persaud's term. She went on to win the special election against Republican Jeffrey Feretti with 82.47% of the vote. Williams was seated in the Assembly on May 10, 2016.

Williams has been assigned to several committees during her tenure, including the Agriculture Committee, Environmental Conservation Committee, Governmental Operations Committee, Real Property Taxation Committee, and the Transportation Committee.

She ran for re-election to the New York State Assembly to represent District 59 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. Her current term ends on January 1, 2025.
