Rob formerly served as Mayor of the City of Poughkeepsie, where he was elected to two consecutive terms. Upon taking office in 2016, Rob inherited a city in severe economic distress. He very quickly and successfully turned the city around â€“ reducing the general fund deficit by $10 million and saving the city from the brink of economic disaster.

Prior to serving as Mayor, Rob was a member of the Dutchess County Legislature for 12 years, representing the City and Town of Poughkeepsie. In 2010, he was elected by his colleagues to serve as Chairman, a position he held for 6 consecutive years. Rob attended Marist College, majoring in Criminal Justice. In 1982 he joined the Town of Poughkeepsie Police Department where he served 12 years in the Patrol Division.

Rob worked his way up the ranks and was promoted to Detective, a post he held for 14 years. Rob is a lifelong resident of Poughkeepsie where he has proudly raised his son, Christopher, and continues to reside with his wife, Lori.
