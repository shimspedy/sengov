Gabriella A. Romero is the Assemblymember for New York State’s 109th Assembly District representing the communities of Albany, New Scotland, and parts of Guilderland.

As the daughter of two proud, unionized state workers, Gabriella grew up with a deep appreciation for public service and the transformative power of collective action.

Gabriella earned her undergraduate degree from Union College where she was selected as a Minerva Fellow post-graduation, serving in Estero de Plátano, Ecuador. She later graduated from Albany Law School distinguishing herself as the Editor-in-Chief of the Government Law Review and as a Pro Bono Scholar.

Following law school, Gabriella served as a public defender working as a felony trial attorney, taking cases to verdict and handling extensive mitigation files, with the goal of contextualizing the root causes of criminal behavior to advocate for fair sentencing and systemic reform. This role deepened her understanding of the systemic criminalization of poverty and housing and food insecurity, inspiring her to champion meaningful changes in these areas.

Gabriella’s career in public service began in 2021 when she was elected to the Albany Common Council representing the 6th Ward. During her tenure she championed tenant rights and criminal justice reform, and she increased youth recreational opportunities, building a reputation as a tireless advocate for her community.

In 2024, Gabriella was elected to the New York State Assembly, where she continues her commitment to equity, justice, and the betterment of the Capital Region.
