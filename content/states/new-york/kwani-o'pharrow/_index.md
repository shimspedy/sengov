Kwani O'Pharrow has an impressive and long-standing record in public service protecting our nation and the great state of New York. He served in the Navy from 1990-1994 as Radioman Petty Officer 3rd Class (RM3)-Intel and retired from the New York City Police Department (NYPD) as a Detective after 25 years of service. His extensive NYPD career brings a wealth of valuable experience, which included: school officer, community patrol officer, domestic violence officer, gang investigations, holding various plainclothes details and assignment to the Chief of Departments office. Notably, Kwani’s final assignment was in the Intelligence Bureau, where he had the privilege of protecting dignitaries such as Presidents Obama and Trump.

Kwani's contributions extend beyond law enforcement. His grandfather, James O’Pharrow, taught him the importance of community building. His grandfather opened Starrett City Boxing in 1978; as a third-generation former president, Kwani utilizes this as an outlet to equip our youth with life skills such as discipline, teamwork and leadership. Kwani is certificated as a USA Boxing Coach and Boxing Fitness Coach.

In 2019, Kwani co-founded Cops N’ Kids Long Island, Inc., an organization focused on mentoring youth and fostering positive relationships between law enforcement and young people. His work included working with local leaders and organizations to administer youth boxing events in the community such as National Night Out, working with youth on Know Your Rights and Responsibilities workshops, financial planning, entrepreneurship, and encouraging young people to join the police department. Kwani created Operation Giveback, an annual program providing essential supplies and toys to families and youth during the holiday season.

His dedication to community relations is evident in his current leadership position in Brentwood, where he oversees a specialized unit called SACRO (Student & Community Relations Officers). Through this role, he forges connections between students, communities, faith-based organizations, local businesses and law enforcement. In addition, Kwani collaborates with SCPD police officer candidates, assisting them with physical training to ensure they meet the initial physical requirements. As a New York State Department of Criminal Justice Law Enforcement Instructor, he imparts essential policing skills and community relations training to new officers at the New York Racing Association Peace Officer Academy.

During the Covid-19 pandemic many families faced challenging times, so Kwani worked with local leaders and organizations to personally fund and deliver food to homebound individuals when Meals on Wheels services were disrupted in Suffolk County. This act of compassion and leadership garnered recognition from reputable sources such as Newsday and News 12, further highlighting his unwavering commitment to serving others.

Kwani and his wife have four beautiful children and five amazing grandchildren. Kwani is committed to building both his Assembly district in Long Island and the state as a whole for all children and families.His platform is rooted in public safety, education, families, veterans, seniors and the environment. He aims to build trust and collaboration between law enforcement and communities, improve access to quality education for all students, and provide support for families through affordable housing and mental health services. Kwani also seeks to honor and support veterans by ensuring they have access to services, and advocate for programs that help seniors age in place with dignity while giving them smooth access to essential services. Additionally, Kwani is committed to environmental protection, advocating for a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for all communities.

Kwani's dedication, integrity, and compassion for Assembly District 11 resonates well with his constituents. He is ready to work tirelessly towards making our community a better place for all.
