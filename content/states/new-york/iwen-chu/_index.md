State Senator Iwen Chu represents New York’s 17th State Senate District, which includes the neighborhoods of Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, Bath Beach, Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, and Kensington. She began her first term in office January 2023 to represent the Asian-majority district and becoming the first Asian woman in the New York State Senate. Senator Chu came to New York with the drive to pursue the American Dream. When studying for her Masters of Sociology from CUNY Brooklyn College, she fell in love with New York’s diverse, vibrant cultures and all our city has to offer. Born and raised in Taiwan, she had dedicated herself to the communities of southern Brooklyn and planted roots with her husband and daughter in Dyker Heights. Senator Chu was a local community journalist focused on amplifying the issues and stories within the AAPI community. Through this role, she found herself bridging the gap between the Asian-American immigrant community and local government. Senator Chu went on to work in the NYS Assembly for ten years, serving neighborhoods in southern Brooklyn. Senator Chu’s dedication to community service included many years serving as a member of local Community Board, Community Education Council, a Board Director of local healthcare center, and as a community partner for the NYPD 68th precinct. The experience and knowledge she gained from working with these organizations has strengthened her commitment and advocacy for southern Brooklyn.

In Albany, Senator Chu is championing the working families and immigrant communities of her district and New York State. She is focused on the top priorities of her constituents: quality education, strong quality of life, support for small businesses, and public safety. During the 2023 legislative season, Senator Chu fought to keep CUNY affordable, restored potential cuts to New York libraries, and delivered $30 million to over 100 AAPI community-based organizations. She is committed to delivering strong constituent services to all in her district and has staff that can speak 10 different languages.
