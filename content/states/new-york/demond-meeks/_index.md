Demond’s educational background includes an Associates from MCC and a BA from SUNY Brockport. He has received additional labor related training and certifications from Cornell University.

Prior to becoming the representative for the 137th NYS Assembly District, Demond worked as an Administrative Organizer with 1199SEIU, representing thousands of healthcare sector employees, and taking on an array of tasks including bargaining contracts and mobilizing workers around workplace and community issues.

Across his two terms in office, Assemblyman Demond Meeks has worked in close collaboration with his state colleagues to secure significant funding and enact transformative legislation in New York State.

Demond’s notable legislative achievements include championing the Fair Access to Victim Compensation Act, eliminating discriminatory barriers and making it easier for victims of violent crime to access compensation and much needed services.
