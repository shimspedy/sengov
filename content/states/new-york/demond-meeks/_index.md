Demond Meeks is an American union organizer and politician who currently serves in the New York State Assembly from the 137th district as a member of the Democratic Party. He is the second African American to represent Monroe County in the Assembly; David Gantt, his predecessor, was the first.

Born and raised in Rochester, NY, Assemblyman Meeks is a dedicated public servant who has worked tirelessly to strengthen our community. Throughout his life, Assemblyman Meeks has been a stalwart advocate for quality education, housing, childcare, fair wages, worker rights, and other key issues facing residents and families.

After graduating from Monroe Community College and SUNY-Brockport, Meeks began working as a labor organizer. He serves as an administrative organizer for 1199SEIU, and is an active member of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists. He has received additional labor-related trainings and certifications from Cornell University.

In 2020, Assemblyman David Gantt announced that he would not seek reelection to the 137th district. Meeks announced his campaign for the seat, and won the Democratic primary against county legislator Ernest Flagler and two other candidates. He faced no opposition in the general election. As Gantt had died over the summer, leaving the seat vacant, Meeks was sworn in early on November 12, 2020.

Meeks lives in Rochester with his wife, Cratrina, and their children. He and his family worship at Aenon Missionary Baptist Church.

Across his two terms in office, Assemblyman Demond Meeks has worked in close collaboration with his state colleagues to secure significant funding and enact transformative legislation in New York State. His notable legislative achievements include championing the Fair Access to Victim Compensation Act, eliminating discriminatory barriers and making it easier for victims of violent crime to access compensation and much needed services. He played a pivotal role in passing the Clean Slate Act into law, which will automatically seal certain criminal convictions for members of our community that have paid their debt to society. This will allow individuals and families to move forward with their lives by creating equitable pathways to jobs, housing, and higher education. Demond has also been a strong supporter of environmental initiatives, co-sponsoring acts to achieve climate justice and emission reduction mandates.
