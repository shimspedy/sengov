Landon Dais is a dedicated community leader, legal expert, and advocate for social justice, with a deep-rooted commitment to The Bronx. His diverse background in law, economic development, and political activism positions him as a unique and powerful voice for his constituents.

Landon is an accomplished attorney who has helped countless small businesses and non-profits expand their influence in New York. His work in the cannabis industry advanced marijuana legalization, workforce development programs, and criminal justice reform. He was honored as the Pro-Bono Attorney of the Year by Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center for his work on marijuana arrests, and his efforts earned him the prestigious NAACP Roy Wilkins Award.

Before embarking on his legal career, Landon served as a Deputy Director at the Police Athletic League and worked at Turner Construction, contributing to projects such as the new Yankee Stadium.

Landon resides with his two sons and wife in Highbridge, where she grew up after immigrating with her family from the Dominican Republic, and now serves on Bronx Community Board 4. Deeply invested in his community, Landon is a member of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, leads the Highbridge Heights Homeowners Association, and contributes his expertise to the Mid Bronx Desperadoes Board (MBD), focusing on building affordable housing in The Bronx.

His passion for youth development is evident through his commitment to coaching baseball twice a week in the Rev. T. Wendell Foster Park (Foster Park) Baseball League, and his founding of a Black and Latino fathers support group called "Brunch of Dads."

Born and raised in New York, Landon began his educational journey at Fordham Prep, laying the foundation for his passion for public service. He went on to earn a B.A. in Business Management from Morehouse College, an M.S. in Real Estate Development from Columbia University, and a J.D. from Hofstra Law School.
