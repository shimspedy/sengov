Leroy George Comrie Jr. was born on August 10, 1958, in New York City. He is an American politician who represents District 14 in the New York State Senate. The district comprises St. Albans, Cambria Heights, Jamaica, Hollis, Rosedale, Laurelton, Kew Gardens, Queens Village, and other neighborhoods within the borough of Queens.

Comrie Jr. is the son of the late Ruby Frith-Comrie and the late Leroy Comrie Sr., both of whom immigrated to the United States from Jamaica. He has one brother. He attended P.S. 116, I.S. 8, Jamaica High School, and the University of Bridgeport, where he developed his passion for politics and government.

Early in his political career, he made much of his living as a photographer for local weddings and community events. Prior to his election to the NYC Council, Comrie served seven years in the office of New York City Council Member Archie Spigner, moving from an aide to Chief of Staff during his tenure. He has also served as a member and eventually president of Community School Board 29.

Leroy Comrie was elected to represent the 27th district in the 2001 elections, succeeding Spigner. After a close election, Comrie won his election for the 27th District by less than 200 votes over his next opponent, local lawyer Helen Cooper-Gregory, in this six-way race. After his first re-election in 2005, Comrie was elected Deputy Majority Leader, also known as Majority Whip, by his Democratic colleagues on the council, as well as head of the Queens delegation, chair of the council's Consumer Affairs Committee, and later chair of the powerful Land Use Committee.

As Deputy Majority Leader, Comrie had access to some of the largest member items, also known as discretionary funding, in the legislative body. These funds went to local organizations throughout Southeast Queens, such as the Black Spectrum Theatre and his local Precinct Community Councils. Comrie also oversaw a sizable capital budget during his tenure allowing him to finance major construction projects in his district, such as the $19 million construction of P.S.36Q. As chair of the Queens Delegation, Comrie worked closely with Borough President Helen Marshall to increase investment into Queens Library allotting tens of millions of dollars annually to the library system through their terms.

Leroy Comrie (Democratic Party) is a member of the New York State Senate, representing District 14. He assumed office on January 1, 2015. His current term ends on January 1, 2025. Comrie (Democratic Party) ran for re-election to the New York State Senate to represent District 14. He won in the general election on November 8, 2022.
