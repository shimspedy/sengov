Kenneth Burgos, born on June 1, 1994, is an American politician from the state of New York. A Democrat, Burgos has represented the 85th district of the New York State Assembly, based in the southeastern Bronx, since November 2020.

Burgos and his three sisters were raised in the Bronx by a single mother. He attended the Bronx High School of Science and graduated from University at Albany, SUNY with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics. Burgos then began working for New York City Council Member Ruben Diaz, Sr., starting as a summer associate and eventually became a deputy chief of staff and budget director. Burgos is a member of Iota Phi Theta fraternity.

In February 2020, Marcos Crespo � Assemblyman for the 85th district and chair of the Bronx County Democratic Party � announced his resignation. Burgos announced he would run for the seat and, with the backing of the Bronx County Democratic Committee, defeated William Moore 62-38% in the Democratic primary. Burgos easily won the general election in the strongly Democratic seat, and was seated on November 12, 2020. In 2024 Burgos was instrumental in preventing New York City from being allowed to set its own speed limits.

A second-generation Bronxite, Kenny grew up in a split-family home and experienced the realities that face so many members of his community. These experiences inspired him to serve the residents of the 85th Assembly District to address these disparities, racial injustice and socio-economic issues. Kenny attended New York City public schools, graduating from the Bronx High School of Science and receiving his Bachelor�s Degree in Economics from the University at Albany.

Throughout his childhood, Kenny split his time between his parents� two respective neighborhoods in the Bronx, often noticing the impact a ZIP code can have on an individual�s resources, opportunities and life. In the New York City Council, Kenny worked firsthand with New York City government agencies, nonprofit organizations and small businesses to solve these disparities and formulate partnerships aimed at improving the communities� local schools, libraries and playgrounds. Kenny also helped host immigration service events, domestic violence aid and programs tackling the food insecurity crisis.

Ultimately, the work of Kenny�s life is to serve, uplift and empower workers, families, young people, tenants, mom-and-pop small business owners and all those left behind by an economy that too often serves the very few at the top. As an Assembly member, Kenny works every day to ensure that the Bronx, New York City and New York State are fairer, more equitable places for all residents. Kenny credits his love for politics, government and advocacy to his big family. He lives in Soundview with his wife and their two dogs, Daenerys and Rhaneyra. He is also an amateur bodybuilder in his free time.
