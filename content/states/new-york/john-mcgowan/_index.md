John W. McGowan is an American attorney, politician, and musician. He is a member of the Republican Party and represents the 97th District of the New York State Assembly. He assumed office on January 1, 2023.

John was born and raised in Rockland County, New York. He graduated from Saint Thomas Aquinas College and later returned to serve as an adjunct professor of criminal law and evidence. He also graduated from New York Law School and was the Managing Editor of the New York Law School Law Review.

After graduation, John served as an Assistant District Attorney in The Bronx and a Senior Assistant District Attorney in his home county of Rockland. He was first elected to public office in 2019, as a member of the Rockland County Legislature from the 15th District. The 15th District included parts of Orangetown, Clarkstown, and Chestnut Ridge.

In late 2022, John announced plans to run for District 97 of the New York State Assembly after incumbent Mike Lawler retired to run for federal congress. He won the election against Democratic challenger Eudson Francois and was sworn in on January 1, 2023.

John is a partner at Bleakley Platt & Schmidt LLP with a focus on representing corporate and individual clients as a member of the Litigation, Labor and Employment Law, Construction Law, and Criminal Defense Practice Groups.

John is not afraid to make tough decisions and seeks to use his legal expertise to prioritize public safety for the residents of the Hudson Valley. He understands that supporting law enforcement personnel is a critical component to ensuring a better and safer New York. Additionally, John focuses on addressing the affordability crisis in this state to preserve the quality of life for those choosing to live and raise their families here, and works to cut wasteful government spending to ease the growing financial burden facing New Yorkers.

He seeks greater support for childrenï¿½s education, to repeal congestion pricing, and to protect local control of zoning and code enforcement. John is involved in many community organizations including serving as President of the Rockland County Ancient Order of the Hibernians.

John currently resides in Pearl River with his wife, Christine, and their two dogs.
