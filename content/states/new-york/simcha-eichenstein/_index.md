Simcha Eichenstein is an American politician from New York. He was born on August 6, 1983, to a rabbi from a prominent Bobover rabbinical family in Borough Park, Brooklyn. He grew up and attended yeshivas in the same neighborhood.

Eichenstein started his career as an aide to political consultant Ezra Friedlander. From 2011 until 2015, he served as the senior adviser to New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. Following this, he was director of political and governmental services to the Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio.

On April 26, 2018, Eichenstein announced his candidacy for the open New York State Assembly District 48 seat, covering most of Borough Park and part of Midwood, Brooklyn, being vacated by Dov Hikind. He won the seat unopposed in the general election, becoming the first Hasidic lawmaker from Brooklyn elected to any level of government. His candidacy was supported by Rebbes of various Hasidic sects, including Bobov, Satmar, Ger, and Belz, as well as by Senator Charles Schumer, former Senator Joe Lieberman, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Eichenstein has strongly opposed the government mandating secular education in Hasidic schools. In March 2020, he co-sponsored a bill promoted by Pamela Hunter that sought to end driver license suspensions for drivers with unpaid fines. In October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Eichenstein said he was "outraged" with the "draconian measures" implemented by Governor Andrew Cuomo to curb the spread of coronavirus in various neighborhoods of New York City.

Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie appointed Eichenstein to serve on a number of committees, including Aging, Cities, Housing, Real Property Taxation, and Social Services.

Eichenstein is a lifelong resident of Borough Park. He and his wife, Pearl, are the proud parents of four children.
