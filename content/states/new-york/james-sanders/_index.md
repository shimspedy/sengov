James Sanders Jr. is a dedicated public servant, community advocate, Marine Veteran, and family man. His life and career are defined by his tireless efforts to uplift others and bring about positive change in his community.

Born in Hammel Houses, a public housing development in the Rockaways, Sanders is a proud product of Southeast Queens. After graduating from Far Rockaway High School, he went on to earn his Bachelor�s degree in history with a specialization in African-American studies from Brooklyn College in 1984.

His passion for community-based initiatives and politics blossomed during his time working for former United States Congressman Floyd H. Flake, an experience which ultimately led to his deep involvement in Southeast Queens communities.

Prior to his time as an elected official, Sanders served Queens School Board District 27 for 10 years, seven of which he spent as the President of the board. He was the first African-American to hold this position. His leadership in the school board inspired his next endeavor as he was elected in 2001 by the people of the 31st district to be their New York City Council Member.

During his time in City Council, Sanders became the first African-American to be voted Chairman of the Economic Development Committee, a vote that was unanimous. Earning this title allowed Sanders the ability to commission studies that allowed for policies of affirmative action, and enhanced opportunities for women and minority owned businesses throughout the city, which were huge wins for the then city council member�s district, and the state of New York as a whole.

Currently in his 6th term, New York State Senator James Sanders Jr. was elected by the people of the 10th senatorial district to the New York State Senate on September 13, 2012. Senator Sanders currently represents the neighborhoods of Breezy Point, Jacob Riis Park, Roxbury, Neponsit, Belle Harbor, Rockaway Park, Rockaway Beach, Broad Channel, Howard Beach, Arverne, Far Rockaway, Wave Crest, Edgemere, Bays Water, Rosedale, South Ozone Park, Jamaica, Richmond Hill, Springfield Gardens, Rochdale, Briarwood, Laurelton, and St. Albans.

Throughout his career, Sanders has emphasized the importance of promoting education, innovation, working-class families, and economic development throughout New York. He continues to approach the legislature with a fresh perspective and promise to bring economic opportunities and resources to the people of Southeast Queens.
