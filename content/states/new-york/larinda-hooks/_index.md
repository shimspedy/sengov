Larinda C. Hooks has spent her life dedicated to uplifting others and transforming communities—work that has defined her service as the newly elected Assembly Member for District 35. A lifelong community organizer and civil rights advocate, Larinda’s focus has always been on improving the quality of life for all. Whether fighting for stronger public schools, more affordable healthcare, safer neighborhoods, or increased economic opportunities, she has simply made it her mission to ensure that every member of the community in Corona, LeFrak City, East Elmhurst, and Rego Park can thrive.

Larinda’s passion for community development took shape early in her career. As President of the Ericsson Street Block Association, she represented her neighbors in the 25th and 27th Avenues area, tirelessly working to improve local quality of life. This commitment only deepened when she joined the East Elmhurst-Corona Civic Association (EECCA), where she eventually served as President of the Executive Board. During this time, she championed equitable civic rights and advocated for initiatives that promoted public safety, community engagement, and access to vital resources.

At the East Harlem Council for Community Improvement, part of the Acacia Network under the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD), Larinda worked to enhance the quality of life for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Her efforts included expanding access to essential support services, improving community integration opportunities, and ensuring resources were directed to programs that uplifted vulnerable populations. This work strengthened her commitment to advocating for inclusive policies and programs that address the needs of all members of society and reinforced her belief that improving the quality of life for any member of the community enriches everyone.

In addition to her grassroots advocacy, Larinda has taken on multiple leadership roles. She served as Vice Chairperson of the Board Members at Elmcor Youth & Adult Activities, Inc., where she helped shape the organization’s mission and strategies. Larinda’s success in this role led to her next career as Vice President of Older Adult Services and Economic Development, a role in which she approached her work holistically, ensuring community members had access to a wide range of resources.

A proud mother of five and grandmother, Larinda personally understands the challenges working families face. She will bring this lived experience to Albany every day, fighting for the fundamental needs of her district—including safe streets, affordable healthcare, and equitable education funding. As Assembly Member for District 35, Larinda C. Hooks continues to be a trusted, proven leader whose commitment to enhancing the quality of life resonates in every neighborhood she serves. She believes that by strengthening our schools, creating economic opportunities, and promoting social equity, we ensure that every resident has the chance to flourish.

Because in the eyes of Assembly Member Hooks, Community is Family—and when we uplift one another, we all rise united as ONE!.
