Joseph A. "Joe" Griffo was born on January 16, 1956, in Rome, New York to Joseph and Betty Griffo. He was educated in the Rome City School District and graduated from Rome Free Academy High School in 1974. He then attended the College at Brockport, State University of New York, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1978.

Griffo started his political career in the Oneida County Legislature, where he served from 1989 to 1991. He was then elected mayor of his hometown of Rome, New York in 1991, and won two subsequent elections in 1995 and 1999. As mayor, Griffo eliminated Rome's special one-quarter percent sales tax. He was able to prevent a tax hike there in all but one of his years in office, despite the crippling loss of Griffiss Air Force Base in 1993 – perhaps the worst single economic blow the county has ever seen. Griffo merged the parks and recreation departments and handed over the city's weights and measures and emergency management departments to the county, resulting in savings. To prevent closures and service cuts, he privatized Rome Hospital, the Erie Canal Village, and city trash collection services.

Griffo was appointed Oneida County executive in June 2003 to serve out the term of his predecessor. He is an American politician serving as a member of the New York Senate from the 53rd district since 2023, and the 47th district from 2007-2022. The 53rd district includes parts of Chenango, Oneida, and Madison Counties. Prior to his election to the Senate, Griffo served as mayor of Rome, New York and as Oneida County executive. A Republican, Griffo serves as deputy minority leader of the State Senate.

Joseph Griffo lives in Rome, New York. His career experience includes working as an intern for New York Assemblyman James Hurley, as an administrative assistant to the mayor of Rome, and as director of community relations for the City of Rome.
