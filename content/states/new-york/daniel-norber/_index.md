Daniel Norber was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 5, 2024. The 16th Assembly District covers Nassau County and is comprised of a portion of the Town of North Hempstead, the Villages of Great Neck, Great Neck Estates, Great Neck Plaza, Kings Point, Lake Success, Manorhaven, Plandome Manor, and Saddle Rock, and the communities of Manhasset, Port Washington, Searingtown, and Williston Park.

Daniel is focused on a common-sense platform that aims to help middle-class working families, reestablish laws that keep crime at bay and residents safe, address the migrant crisis, and improve the access and affordability of education and healthcare.

Daniel is a first-generation American. His grandparents survived the Holocaust, and his mother escaped the injustices of Soviet Union communism. His parents taught him the value of hard work, serving others, sacrifice, and the priceless gift of freedom. These foundational lessons have empowered Daniel to pursue the American dream that so many families pursue for their children and grandchildren.

Daniel was born in the United States and raised in Israel. He was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces at 17 years old, where he served as a staff sergeant in the military police. Work in the military helped shape his character and orient it to help others. Daniel graduated from Reichman University earning a bachelor’s degree in political science and government.

Daniel’s work ethic has driven him to become a successful self-made businessman. Shortly before September 11, Daniel moved to New York City and worked in consumer sales and managed a restaurant group. After transitioning out of the restaurant industry, he established his own moving business, which is now one of the most reputable relocation companies in the region and has created thousands of jobs. In addition, he has successfully invested in industrial real estate throughout the region.

Daniel and his wife, Inbal, have four children: Michelle, Idan, Karin, and Jonathan. He is involved with several religious organizations as well as community groups that support veterans through Samaritan Village and women through Women In Need.
