Angelo J. Morinello is the Assembly member for the 145th District of the New York State Assembly. He is a Republican. The district includes Niagara Falls, North Tonawanda as well as Lewiston in Erie and Niagara counties.

Morinello was born and raised in Western New York, and is a veteran of the War in Vietnam. An attorney, Morinello served as the in-house counsel for his family's business, Certo Brothers Distributing Company. He previously served as an assistant Nassau County district attorney, as well as the counsel to Niagara Falls Community Development.

Before his political career, Morinello served as Niagara Falls City Court judge from 2001 to 2015. In 2016, Assemblyman John Ceretto switched parties, becoming a Democrat after initially being elected as a Republican. While the district was competitive on paper, it historically had supported Republicans. Morinello was drafted by Republicans to run against Ceretto in 2016. The campaign was one of the most expensive Assembly races of the cycle. In a good year for Republicans, he defeated Ceretto 55% to 45%. He was sworn into office on January 1, 2017.

Morinello's diverse background will ensure the citizens of the 145th Assembly District have a strong and skilled representative in Albany who can address the important issues. He is committed to reforming Albany and is ready to address the culture of corruption in state government. Throughout his legal and judicial career, he has been guided by the strictest ethical standards and is ready to question the lack of standards in the Legislature today. He will also work to implement workforce development programs, create more jobs and address the impact of drugs and violence on New York’s families.
