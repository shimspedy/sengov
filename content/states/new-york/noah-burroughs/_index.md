Growing up in Hempstead, Noah Burroughs was surrounded by a community that placed a premium on the transformative power of education. From an early age, his parents instilled in him the belief that education was the key to unlocking a brighter future. They understood the opportunities it could afford and were determined to provide him with the tools to succeed. Alongside his parents, educators in the Hempstead Schools played a pivotal role in shaping Noah’s trajectory. They recognized his potential and were committed to nurturing it, guiding him in mapping out a blueprint for his future.

With their unwavering support, Noah embarked on a journey of personal and academic growth, fueled by a deep-seated passion for learning and a desire to make a meaningful impact on his community. Through their guidance, he cultivated the values of integrity, resilience, and compassion, which would serve as the cornerstones of his public service endeavors. Noah's upbringing in Hempstead laid the groundwork for his commitment to public service, instilling in him a sense of duty and responsibility to give back to the community that had given him so much.

Noah’s dad was a staffer with the SCLC, which was Martin Luther King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference, having a strong family legacy and a belief that education was key for the advancement of minorities. The strong family legacy indoctrinated in Noah’s mother is what led to him to being involved in service to the community. Listening to magical stories from his dad integrating Savannah and Atlanta, Georgia, during the civil rights era is what stimulated the thought of fighting for the rights of others. Noah therefore followed the blueprint created by his parents. He graduated from Hempstead High School and pursued a higher education.

Noah became an educator and has served Hempstead’s children for over 20 years. He is a tireless advocate dedicated to the success of one of our most vulnerable populations. In 2021, Noah successfully ran for Village Trustee. In this capacity, Trustee Burroughs was able to achieve great accomplishments with the current Mayor that improved the quality of life for residents such as revoking business licenses for illegal gambling machines, untaxed cigarettes and illegal prescription drugs; voted to enact legislation to increase the income limits for the village’s senior citizens tax exemption; and helped create a greater police presence in senior housing properties. Noah would now like to use his experience and political knowledge to reach further and serve a larger constituency in the 18th Assembly District.
