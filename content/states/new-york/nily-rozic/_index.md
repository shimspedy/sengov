Nily Rozic is a dedicated legislator from Queens, New York, and a member of the New York State Assembly. Born on March 15, 1986, in Jerusalem, she represents New York's 25th District, which spans the northeast portions of Queens. This includes the communities of Flushing, Queensboro Hill, Hillcrest, Fresh Meadows, Oakland Gardens, Bayside, and Douglaston.

Upon her election in 2012, Assemblywoman Rozic became the youngest woman in the state legislature and the first woman ever to represent the 25th District. She is currently the chair of the Assembly�s Committee on Consumer Affairs and Protection, which works diligently to protect consumers from fraud and discriminatory business practices, ensure data privacy, and regulate credit and pricing practices in New York.

Before her election, Rozic was Chief of Staff to Assemblymember Brian Kavanagh. This role allowed her to help protect senior centers and programs from drastic cuts, increase parkland and open space, expand neighborhood bus service, and bring much-needed reform to Albany by pushing for the revamping of city elections and instituting of public financing for state elections.

In Queens, Nily is focused on serving day-to-day needs and fighting for key quality of life issues in her district. In Albany, Nily is an outspoken advocate for working and middle-class families, immigrant communities, and students. She has already sponsored and passed legislation aimed at revitalizing New York�s environment, expanding government transparency, and strengthening the state�s workforce development system. She is also committed to social justice, equality, and opportunity for all.

Nily was also selected as one of The Jewish Week's 36 Under 36 and was named as a Rising Star on City & State�s annual list of the Next Generation of Political Leaders for becoming an influential force in New York State politics as a young elected official.
