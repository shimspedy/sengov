Edward L. Gibbs, known as Eddie Gibbs, was born on October 28, 1968, in New York, New York, U.S. He is an American politician who is currently representing the 68th district in the New York State Assembly since 2022. He is the first formerly incarcerated New York Assembly member.

Eddie Gibbs was born and raised in East Harlem (El Barrio), Randallï¿½s Island, and parts of the Upper East Side and Central Harlem. His upbringing in East Harlem shaped him into a community organizer. He grew up with limited financial resources and tough prospects for the future. Even before he held an official title, he dedicated his life to serving and supporting his neighbors.

At only 17 years old, Eddie turned himself in after committing a crime. He served time in prison and then returned to the community where he was dedicated to creating positive change. He credits his incarceration with turning his life around and is motivated as an elected official to make sure that everyone has chances in life right from the start, free from violence and poverty.

As a community leader for over two decades, Eddie has held annual coat drives for seniors and people experiencing homelessness, Thanksgiving dinners, Christmas toy giveaways, back-to-school supply drives for underprivileged kids and numerous other events. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Eddie cared for vulnerable seniors and distributed food, water and PPE. He often sat with elderly people in the community to help them find vaccine appointments, sometimes walking neighbors to their appointments.

Eddie Gibbs co-sponsored Assembly Bill A2322 which repeals the ban preventing incarcerated persons from receiving Tuition Assistance Program funding from New York State to pursue higher education. Assemblymember Gibbs served time in prison where he earned a degree from Cayuga Community College.
