Kevin Parker, born on March 6, 1967, is an American politician from the state of New York. He is a member of the Democratic Party and has been serving in the New York State Senate since 2002. He represents the 21st district, which comprises portions of the Brooklyn neighborhoods of East Flatbush, Flatbush, Midwood, Ditmas Park, Kensington, Park Slope, and Windsor Terrace.

Before his political career, Parker held a number of different public sector roles. He served as an intergovernmental aide to New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and as a New York City Urban Fellow under Manhattan Borough President and mayoral candidate Ruth Messinger. He also ran unsuccessfully in the New York City Council District 45 Democratic primary in 2001.

In 2002, Parker defeated former City Councilman Noach Dear in a tightly-contested Democratic primary for a newly drawn, open State Senate seat in Brooklyn. He won the 2002 general election and was elected to the Senate for the first time. In the 2008 Democratic primary, Parker held off a strong challenge from New York City Councilmembers Simcha Felder and Kendall Stewart. He won the primary with less than 50% of the vote.

Parker has been known for his work in the Senate. On June 24, 2011, the State Senate passed the Marriage Equality Act. Parker voted in favor of the legislation, which was signed into law that evening. However, he stormed to the podium where Lieutenant Gov. Robert Duffy was presiding and then left the Senate floor in protest because he was not allowed to speak on the bill.

Despite his achievements, Parker has also been known for his angry outbursts, some of which have been violent. In 2010, he was convicted by a jury of two counts of criminal mischief for attacking a New York Post photographer, damaging their camera and car door, and breaking their finger.

Parker is the son of Sonie and Georgie Parker. He attended P.S. 193, Andries Hudde I.S. 240, and Midwood High School in Brooklyn. Parker received a Bachelor of Science degree in Public Service from Penn State.
