Ramos is the son of a correction officer and a registered nurse. After graduating from Brentwood High School in 1974, he began his career as a therapy aide at the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center. He later became an emergency medical technician. Ramos then joined the Suffolk County police force, where he worked for eight years in the narcotics unit as an undercover officer. He was promoted to detective in 1987 and retired in 1999.

In 2002, Ramos decided to run for the New York Assembly to succeed Republican Robert Wertz, who was retiring after thirty years to seek a seat in the New York Senate. In a close race, he defeated Republican Philip Goglas 53% to 47%.

Ramos represents the 6th District of the New York Assembly as a Democrat. The district includes portions of the town of Islip, including Bay Shore, Brentwood, Central Islip, and Islandia in Suffolk County on Long Island.

Ramos currently sits on the Labor, Local Governments, Ways and Means, Aging, and Education committees. He has been serving as the Deputy Speaker of the New York State Assembly since January 4, 2023.
