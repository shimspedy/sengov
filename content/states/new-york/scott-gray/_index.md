Scott Gray is an American politician from New York who represents the 116th district of the New York State Assembly as a Republican. He assumed office on January 3, 2023, succeeding Mark Walczyk.

Born and raised in Watertown, New York, Gray is the fourth-generation owner of his family's small business, Gray�s Flower Shop. His deep roots in the community and firsthand experience as a small business owner have given him a unique understanding of the challenges of running a business in New York.

Gray served 21 years as a county legislator for Jefferson County and six years as the Chairman of the Jefferson County Board of Legislators. Known for working across the aisle to get the job done, his leadership was instrumental in driving growth and development in the county.

In the 2022 election, Gray faced businesswoman Susan Duffy for the Republican primary. Upon his victory, Duffy refused to concede and continued to run for the Assembly seat, winning the Conservative nomination while the Democrats did not stand any candidate. Despite this, Gray went on to defeat Duffy with 70% of the vote to her 30%.

The first bill that Gray introduced to the assembly would allow the Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority to hire peace officers to work at Ogdensburg International Airport. This initiative showcases his commitment to enhancing the safety and security of his constituents.

Beyond his political career, Gray has served his community in a variety of capacities. He has been a board member of numerous local organizations including the United Way of North New York and the Carthage Area Hospital Board. He is also a recipient of the Secretary of the Army�s Public Service Commendation Medal, which is awarded in recognition of service or achievements that contribute significantly to the accomplishment of an Army activity.

Scott Gray continues to live in Watertown, serving his community and striving to make New York a better place for all its residents.
