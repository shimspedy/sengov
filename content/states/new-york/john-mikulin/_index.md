John Mikulin was elected to the New York State Assembly on April 24, 2018. His district is entirely in Nassau County, New York.

As an assemblyman, John is fighting to lower taxes, reduce outmigration, combat New York’s devastating opioid crisis and make our state more business friendly. He’s working hard to reform New York’s economic development programs and eliminate wasteful spending.

He also supports local control of education and eliminating the haphazardly implemented New York State Common Core Learning Standards.

John was president of the Island Trees Library Board and served as the deputy town attorney in the Town of Hempstead prior to being elected to the New York State Assembly. He has a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in Government and has a Juris Doctor Degree from the Touro Law Center.

Dedicated to making the community a better place, John is an active parishioner at St. James Roman Catholic Church and is also a member of the Levittown Property Association.

John and his wife, Corinne, reside in Bethpage in the Town of Hempstead.
