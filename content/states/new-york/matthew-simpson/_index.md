Matthew Simpson is an American politician who is currently serving in the New York State Assembly. He represents the 114th district, which encompasses all of Essex and Warren counties, and portions of Saratoga and Washington counties. He assumed office on January 6, 2021.

Simpson was born on August 4, 1967. He grew up in Bolton, New York. His father was a teacher and his mother was a nurse at Glens Falls Hospital. After graduating from Hoosic Valley High School in 1985, he started his own dry wall company and worked as a business owner for more than 30 years.

Before his political career, Simpson served on the Horicon, New York Town Board for two years. He then ran unopposed and was elected supervisor of the town. He also served as president of the Adirondack Association of Towns and Villages.

In December 2019, Simpson announced his intentions to run for the 114th Assembly District upon the incumbent, Dan Stec, announcing his desire to represent the 45th district of the New York State Senate. Simpson was elected to the assembly in 2020, defeating Democratic challenger Claudia Braymer and Serve America Movement candidate Evelyn Wood, earning 56.7% of the vote. Upon being elected to the state assembly, he retired his town supervisor seat on December 31, 2020.

Throughout his first term as Assemblyman, he worked to rein in out-of-control spending, fought for lower taxes, eliminated burdensome unfunded mandates, and improved the state’s failing infrastructure. Simpson will continue to advocate for better resources for law enforcement while making public safety a priority; protect the state’s vibrant state parks; gain financial support for local businesses; hold the government accountable for lack of transparency; and work to keep money in the pockets of hard working taxpayers.
