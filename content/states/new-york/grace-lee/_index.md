Grace Lee is a community organizer, small-business owner, mom to three children and first-generation American. She has a proven track record of successfully mobilizing and organizing around local issues, from co-founding Children First, a parent-led coalition demanding the safe cleanup of a mercury brownfield in the seaport, to empowering deaf tenants living in deplorable conditions on the Lower East Side to stand up to their buildingâ€™s management and demand repairs. Grace has also been a prominent voice against anti-Asian hate in New York City. She is the first Korean American woman elected to New York State government.

Alongside her work in community organizing, Grace is the co-founder of Nine Naturals, a toxin-free beauty line for pregnant and new moms. She received her B.A. from Columbia University and her M.B.A. from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Grace is a long-time Lower Manhattan resident where she lives with her husband and three young daughters.
