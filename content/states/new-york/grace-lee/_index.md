Grace Lee, born as Lee Kyung-hee in Seoul, South Korea, is a prominent figure in the Philippine television industry. She is one of the few Korean expatriates who have made a significant impact on Philippine television. Other notable expatriates include Sandara Park, Ryan Bang, and Sam Oh.

Grace Lee was born and raised in Seoul, but moved to the Philippines at the age of 10 due to her father's business, which involved importing Korean cars. She studied from second grade to fourth year high school at St. Paul College in Pasig and graduated from Ateneo de Manila University, where she obtained her Communication Arts degree.

Before becoming a TV host, she had been hosting events for Korean-Filipino communities as well as being an official interpreter for Malaca�ang. Lee planned on becoming a journalist. She sent her r�sum� to major television studios in the Philippines and received a callback from GMA Network.

She landed her first Philippine TV hosting job in March 2007 as a segment host on Q 11�s lifestyle-magazine show The Sweet Life. Among her first assignments include featuring life in Korea where she gets to wear traditional female garb as well as interviewing prominent Korean celebrities such as Yoon Se Ah of Lovers in Prague and The Great King, Sejong drama series.

She stayed with Magic 89.9 from 2007 up to 2012 co-hosting the morning radio show Good Times with Mo with Mo Twister and Mojo Jojo as a replacement for Andi-9. Lee is also a Manila correspondent for YTN in Korea, as well as teaching at the Manila New Life Church's Sunday school for preschool students and takes part in various outreach programs.

In 2015, she left the country to go back home to her native country and serve there. She can speak Tagalog and English in addition to her native Korean.
