Karl A. Brabenec, born on July 12, 1979, is a prominent figure in the New York State Assembly. He represents the 98th District and is a member of the Republican Party. His political journey in the Assembly began in 2014 when he emerged victorious in a special election.

The 98th District, which Brabenec represents, encompasses parts of Orange and Rockland Counties in the Hudson Valley. In January 2023, Brabenec ascended to the role of Assembly Minority Whip, a position he holds after serving as the Deputy Minority Whip since 2019.

Brabenec was born in Manhasset, New York, and spent his early years in Bayside, Queens, before moving with his family to Slate Hill, New York, at the age of 8. He completed his high school education at Minisink Valley High School and graduated from Mount Saint Mary College in 2000. Furthering his education, he received his Masters of Public Administration from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2005.

His parents, Rainer K. Brabenec and Emilie (Popule) Brabenec, both served with the New York City Police Department. They are Czechoslovak refugees from the former Sudetenland who fled from Soviet communist oppression in the late 1940s.

Brabenec's career in public service began at the age of 18 when he was appointed as events coordinator for the City of Newburgh, New York. He later served as executive director of the Downing Park Planning Committee and as a staff assistant to Orange County Executive Edward A. Diana in the early 2000s.

In 2007, Brabenec was appointed by the Deerpark Town Board to serve as a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals. Later that year, he was elected to serve as a Deerpark Town councilman. In 2009, he ran for town supervisor and was elected that November.

Brabenec has been active in various community organizations and has received numerous awards for his service. He currently resides in Westbrookville, New York, and is the proud father of two children, Karl and Kimberlee.
