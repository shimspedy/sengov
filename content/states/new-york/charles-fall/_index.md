Charles Fall (born March 12, 1989) is a member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 61st District since 2019. He is a Democrat. The district includes portions of the North Shore of Staten Island. Charles Fall is the first Muslim elected to the Assembly. He was born and raised on Staten Island following his parents' immigration from Guinea.

Before his political career, Fall served as the Staten Island Borough Director and Citywide Islamic Liaison for the Mayor of New York City. He worked to ensure Universal Prekindergarten and paid sick leave became realities. Fall then became the Chief of Staff to the Staten Island Parks and Recreation Commissioner with the desire to enhance local greenery to encourage community recreation and create safer neighborhoods.

Fall earned his BA from Southwestern College in Kansas and received a Master of Public Administration with honors at Pace University. In his spare time, Charles has always had a passion for running and basketball. He starts each morning with a run, a habit that began in high school. He played college basketball and now extends that love to young kids in his community, hosting basketball clinics with different organizations on the North Shore of Staten Island. Empowering young people to set and reach their physical and mental aspirations is central to who he is.

Today, Charles resides in his childhood neighborhood, Mariners Harbor, with his two daughters, Maimouna and Naila.
