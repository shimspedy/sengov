Timothy Martin Kennedy, born on October 20, 1976, is an American politician and a member of the New York State Senate. He represents the 63rd district since January 2013. Before that, he represented the 58th district from 2011 to 2013. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Kennedy was raised in South Buffalo, one of five children of Martin F. and Mary Kennedy. His father worked as Buffalo's commissioner of assessment and taxation, and his mother is a retired nurse who teaches nursing at D'Youville College. He received his early education at St. Martin's Elementary School, and attended St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute. He earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in occupational therapy from D'Youville College.

From 1999 to 2010, Kennedy worked as a licensed occupational therapist at Catholic Health. In late 2004, at the age of 28, Kennedy was appointed to the Erie County Legislature, representing the 2nd district, after Mark J. F. Schroeder was elected to the State Assembly. In 2005, Kennedy defeated Democratic primary opponent Paul Sullivan by a vote of 65% to 35%. He won 72% of the vote in the general election against his Republican opponent, Julieanne Mazurkiewicz. In 2007, Kennedy ran unopposed for a second full term to the Erie County Legislature.

In 2010, Kennedy challenged incumbent William Stachowski for the Democratic nomination for the 58th district in the New York State Senate. Kennedy also earned the endorsement of the Conservative Party, which had previously supported Stachowski. Stachowski was one of eight Democratic state senators who had voted against a bill allowing same-sex marriage in New York, while Kennedy supported it, earning him the backing of gay rights organizations in the primary. Kennedy ultimately defeated Stachowski by a margin of 63% to 26% amid a wave of anti-incumbent voter sentiment. Stachowski remained on the ballot on the Independence Party and Working Families Party lines. In the 2010 general election, Kennedy defeated Republican Assemblyman Jack Quinn III, gaining 47% of the vote to Quinn's 45%.

Since being sworn into office in January 2011, Senator Tim Kennedy has fought to ensure Western New York sees its fair share of funding and state resources. In March 2019, three months after being named Chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, Tim delivered an unprecedented $100 million for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) to fund a five year capital plan for maintenance and improvements of the Metro Rail. In his role as Chair, Tim has set an aggressive agenda. He sponsored legislation to allow municipalities to install cameras on school buses, in order to more effectively catch drivers who break the law and jeopardize student safety by passing stopped buses. He also spearheaded a package comprehensive limo safety reforms, in order to strengthen the industry standards and better protect New Yorkers who use alternative transportation. Tim drafted these reforms alongside the families of victims involved in limo crashes in Schoharie and Cutchogue. Both houses have passed these transportation priorities, and the Governor quickly signed them into law.

Throughout his time in office, Tim has kept a strong focus on protecting the most vulnerable in our community. He spearheaded the passage of Jay-J’s law, legislation that stiffens penalties for repeat child abusers. The legislation was inspired by Jay-J Bolvin, a young boy who was brutally abused by his father. Sadly, Jay-J’s father received a light sentence due to antiquated sentencing laws, but through Tim’s advocacy, these penalties were strengthened. Tim also penned Jackie’s Law, which protects victims of domestic violence from GPS stalking, and was signed into law in 2014.

Tim knows the importance of growing and protecting Western New York’s workforce, which is why he was a supporter of the creation of the Northland Workforce Center on Buffalo’s East Side. He actively works to connect Western New Yorkers with job opportunities, whether through his jobs website, Kennedy Jobs File, or through his annual Queen City Job Fair, which draws hundreds of employers and job seekers every year. While he regularly works one-on-one with companies to establish roots in Buffalo, he strongly believes in preserving the city’s past. He led the call for $5 million of the Buffalo Billion funding to be dedicated towards the reuse and restructuring of Buffalo’s iconic Central Terminal, and helped to bring the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra to the Terminal for a full day East Side Festival, offering a free concert to thousands of Western New Yorkers.

Tim is a lifelong Western New York resident. He grew up in a blue-collar family in Buffalo, where his parents, Marty and Mary Kennedy, raised Tim and his four siblings to work hard, focus on their education, help their neighbors, and get involved in their community.
