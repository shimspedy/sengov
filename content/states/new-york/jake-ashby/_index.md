Jake Ashby is a dedicated public servant and a respected member of the New York State Senate. He was elected to the Senate on November 8, 2022, representing the 43rd District, which includes all of Rensselaer County and parts of Washington and Albany Counties.

Before his tenure in the Senate, Ashby served in the State Assembly from 2018 to 2022. During this time, he sponsored legislation to make occupational and speech therapy more accessible, a bill that was subsequently signed into law by the governor. He also worked across party lines to pass a bill that would expedite the naturalization process for the family members of service members and veterans.

In addition to his legislative accomplishments, Ashby authored legislation to protect New Yorkers from carcinogenic contaminants in drinking water. Following this, state officials adopted more stringent safety standards. As a senator, Ashby continues to bring his common sense, bipartisan approach to the State Senate. His top priorities include delivering real tax relief, promoting public safety, and expanding mental health care for first responders, law enforcement officials, and healthcare workers.

Ashby is also a strong advocate for veterans, having served as a Captain in the United States Army Reserve. He completed combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq and deployed in support of a humanitarian mission in Africa. He continues to advocate for programming that helps veterans transition to civilian life.

Beyond his political career, Ashby has worked as an occupational therapist and rehabilitation director for the last 20 years. He operated his own community-based practice and has also worked as an instructor at Maria College.

Ashby earned his MBA in Healthcare Management from Union Graduate College in Schenectady, NY, a Bachelor of Science in Occupational Therapy from Keuka College, and an Associate in Arts from Hudson Valley Community College.

He is a communicant of Sacred Heart Church and the past commander of VFW Post 7337. He is also a member of the Castleton Fish and Game Club. Ashby resides in Castleton with his wife, Kristy, and their two children.
