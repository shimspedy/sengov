Brian Patrick Kavanagh, born on January 18, 1967, is an American politician who has been serving the 27th district in the New York State Senate since December 2017. This district represents Lower Manhattan and the western part of Brooklyn. Before this, he served in the New York State Assembly representing the East Side of Manhattan.

Kavanagh is a lifelong resident of New York City. He was born and raised on Staten Island and graduated from Regis High School in Manhattan. He tutored students at the Lower East Side Nativity Mission Center. He graduated with a B.A. in politics from Princeton University in 1989. He then received a Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law. He worked as an attorney at the New York law firms Kaye Scholer and Schulte Roth & Zabel.

While living in Manhattan, Kavanagh lived in many different neighborhoods: the Lower East Side, Murray Hill, NoMad, and Turtle Bay. He was an aide to former New York City Mayors Ed Koch and David Dinkins. He served as chief of staff to New York City Council member Gale Brewer.

Kavanagh began government service as an aide to Mayor Ed Koch and has served in three mayoral administrations. After the Happy Land Social Club fire claimed the lives of 87 people in 1990, Kavanagh helped coordinate the city's response to the tragedy on behalf of Mayor David Dinkins, co-designing a task force that shut down the most grievous fire code offenders. At the Mayor's Office, Brian also played a key role in launching the New York City Department of Homeless Services and he then served as the agency's first Policy Director.

As Chief-of-Staff for then-New York City Council member Gale Brewer, Kavanagh negotiated enactment of the Domestic Worker Protection Act, promoting the rights of housekeepers and caregivers. With then-Councilmember Bill Perkins, Councilmember Brewer, and dozens of their colleagues on the Council, Kavanagh helped to draft and secure passage of Council Resolution 549, opposing the imminent invasion of Iraq.

Kavanagh has served as a counselor, volunteer, and board member at the Lower East Side's Nativity Middle School and community center.
