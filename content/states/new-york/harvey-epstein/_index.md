Harvey Epstein is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the New York State Assembly for the 74th district. He was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on May 20, 2018.

Epstein was born on February 5, 1967, in Wantagh, New York. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree from Ithaca College and later earned his Juris Doctor degree from the CUNY School of Law.

Epstein represents the East Side of Manhattan, including the neighborhoods of the Lower East Side, East Village, Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper Village, Murray Hill, Kips Bay, Tudor City, and the United Nations. He has been a community leader for more than 20 years. Before he was elected to the Assembly, he served on Community Board 3 for 14 years as its board chair, and chair of its Land Use Committee.

As a public-school parent, Epstein is a former president of the District 1 Presidentï¿½s Council and former PTA president at the Neighborhood School (where his children attended). He has engaged in numerous community struggles to protect low-wage workers, local day-care centers, and diversity in admissions at public schools. He is a former Co-President of CoDA (a local political organization) and has worked on numerous progressive campaigns over the past few decades.

Epstein's efforts during his five-year tenure as a tenant member of the Rent Guidelines Board were crucial in successfully orchestrating the first and second rent freezes for one-year leases in the 47-year history of the Rent Guidelines Board. This historic achievement has helped millions of New Yorkers preserve their affordable rent-stabilized apartments.

An experienced leader and advocate for the progressive movement, Epstein has introduced, voted for, and supported legislation that protects the rights of LGBTQIA and non-binary New Yorkers, promotes environmental sustainability, supports public education, and makes voting easier. He has tackled deep inequities in the criminal justice system by fighting to end the excessive use of solitary confinement, to legalize adult use marijuana, expunge records for New Yorkers with marijuana related offenses, reform the parole system, and to make it easier for incarcerated people to earn a college degree.

In his first full term in office, Epstein co-authored and passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 that protects tenants and preserves affordable housing in New York City. He won the passage of legislation to create a dedicated funding stream for public transit, expand early voting for New Yorkers, codify Roe v Wade in the state of New York, and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. He has introduced legislation to tax the ultra-wealthy to fund public housing, as well as legislation to create composting programs in all state agencies and reduce the use of plastic in our State.

Epstein has supported the passage of hundreds of pieces of legislation and has been a progressive leader in the State Legislature. He continues to fight for racial and economic justice and systemic change through legislation.
