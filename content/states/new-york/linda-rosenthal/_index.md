Linda B. Rosenthal, born on November 12, 1957, is a representative of District 67 as a Democrat in the New York State Assembly. This district includes parts of Manhattan's Upper West Side and Clinton/Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods.

Early Life:
Linda Rosenthal was born in 1957 to parents who fled the Nazis in the 1930s. She earned a B.A. degree in history from the University of Rochester in 1980.

Political Career:
In 1993, Rosenthal began working for US Congressman Jerry Nadler, who represented New York's 10th congressional district. She served as Manhattan District Director and Director of Special Projects. Prior to this, she worked in publishing.

New York State Assembly:
Rosenthal was elected to the New York State Assembly in a February 2006 special election for District 67. This election was held to replace Scott Stringer, who left the Assembly to become Manhattan Borough President. Rosenthal won the November 2008 general election with 84.7 percent of the vote, and ran uncontested in the November 2010 general election.

In May 2015, fellow Manhattan Democrat Richard N. Gottfried tried to curb a bill introduced by Rosenthal that would allow customers to bring their dogs to outdoor restaurants. However, the bill passed the Senate in May 2015 by a 60-0 vote. In March 2016, following the State Legislature's passage of her bill, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued an advisory allowing dogs to accompany human diners at restaurants that have outdoor seating.

In March 2019, she introduced a bill, A5040, that will ban a sale of fur in New York, by 2021. New York would follow California, which is in the process of legislating the ban. Also in 2019, New York passed Rosenthal's bill A1303B, the first statewide law to ban cat declawing in the United States. She worked closely with the nonprofit animal advocacy organization, The Paw Project, to pass the bill.
