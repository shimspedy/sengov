Andrea Bailey was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 5, 2024. The 133rd Assembly District is comprised of Livingston County and parts of Monroe, Ontario, Steuben, and Wyoming counties.

A lifelong resident of Livingston County, Andrea lives in Geneseo with her husband, Jon where their three children Morgan, Ryan, and Lyndon also reside. She brings a wealth of experience to her role, having spent eight years in the Livingston County Clerk’s Office where she managed day-to-day operations and played an integral role in leadership decisions. During this time, she gained a deep understanding of legal processes and the complex issues that have come out of Albany.

In addition to her public service background, Andrea has more than 20 years of experience in the private sector, working in operations, human resources, and service equipment. This broad skill set has equipped her with the tools to tackle the challenges facing both the 133rd Assembly District and the State of New York.

As a mother, Andrea is aware of the financial pressures many families face. She is committed to advancing common-sense policies aimed at lowering the cost of living, including affordable childcare, reducing utility bills, and addressing the housing crisis. She is also dedicated to reducing taxes and cutting government spending to put more money back into the pockets of hardworking New Yorkers.

Andrea believes that public safety is a cornerstone of strong communities. She will work to ensure criminals are held accountable and she supports fully funding law enforcement agencies to keep families and neighborhoods safe.

A strong advocate for small-town values, Andrea recognizes that small businesses and local farming are the backbone of New York State’s economy and is committed to supporting these sectors. Additionally, Andrea supports making strong investments in our education system.

Andrea’s experience as a member of the Geneseo Town Board has provided her with a practical understanding of government and public service. She is dedicated to bringing that experience to Albany to serve her district and the state.
