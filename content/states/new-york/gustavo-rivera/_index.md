Gustavo Rivera is a prominent figure in New York politics, currently serving as a state senator representing the 33rd Senate District. This district covers the Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge Heights, Kingsbridge, Fordham, University Heights, Van Nest, Tremont, East Tremont, and parts of Morrisania and Parkchester. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Born on November 19, 1975, in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Rivera moved to New York after completing his B.A. in political science from the University of Puerto Rico in May 1998. He began a doctoral program in political science at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

Before his political career, Rivera taught courses at Hunter College until 2002 and served as an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Pace University until his first election in 2010. He has also served as campaign manager for politicians such as Phil Reed and his future colleagues Jose M. Serrano and Andrea Stewart-Cousins. In September 2010, he was named one of City Hall's "40 under 40" for being a young influential member of New York City politics.

Rivera first assumed office on January 1, 2011, succeeding Pedro Espada, Jr. His election was a significant event, as he defeated the incumbent, Senator Pedro Espada Jr., who had long been a staple in Bronx politics. Espada was later convicted of embezzlement.

In the Senate, Rivera is known as a leading progressive voice. With the Democrats retaking the majority in 2018, Rivera was named Chair of the Senate Health Committee. He has advocated for single-payer health insurance. His goal as the Chair is to collaborate with his colleagues, stakeholders, and constituents to improve health outcomes, increase access to coverage, and ensure a financially viable system for the 20 million New Yorkers he proudly serves.

In addition to his work in the Senate, Rivera launched the Bronx CAN (Changing Attitudes Now) Health Initiative in 2011. The goal of this community-oriented health initiative is to encourage Bronx residents to develop healthy behaviors and to shape policies that help tear down some of the institutional barriers that stand in the way of Bronxites having a healthier lifestyle.

Rivera has also championed and empowered Latino communities across New York State and the United States. In 2018, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) elected Senator Rivera to serve an initial three-year term on the nonpartisan organization's 35-member Board of Directors. NALEO’s mission looks to foster civic engagement in Latino communities, increase the effectiveness of Latino policymakers, and promote policies that advance Latino political engagement.
