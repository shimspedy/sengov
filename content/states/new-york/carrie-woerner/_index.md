Carrie Woerner is a member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 113th District. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district she represents includes portions of Saratoga, Warren, and Washington Counties.

Born on April 7, 1962, Woerner is a graduate of Carnegie-Mellon University and Santa Clara University. Before entering politics, she had a thirty-year career in software development. She founded MeetMax Conference Software, located in Saratoga Springs.

Woerner served as a Round Lake Village Trustee from 2008 to 2012, and was a member of the Town of Malta Planning Board from 2008 to 2014. She has been active in historic preservation efforts throughout Saratoga Springs and the surrounding area.

In 2012, Woerner first ran for the Assembly, but lost to incumbent Tony Jordan. In 2014, Jordan was not a candidate for re-election after winning election as Washington County District Attorney in 2013. Woerner decided to run again and this time prevailed over Republican Steve Stallmer. She was seated on January 1, 2015.

As of January 2023, Assemblywoman Woerner is the Chair of the Assembly Libraries and Education Technology Committee. She has continued to advocate for responsible spending and is focused on improving the business climate for small businesses and farms, strengthening public schools, and protecting the traditions, heritage, and culture of Saratoga and Washington counties.
