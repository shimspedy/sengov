Phara Souffrant Forrest is an American politician, nurse, and tenant activist. She is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and currently serves as the assembly member for the 57th district of the New York State Assembly.

Born on February 5, 1989, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Phara is the daughter of immigrants from Haiti. She is a lifelong resident of the 57th District and a proud product of Brooklyn�s public school system. She attended Philippa Schuyler Middle School and Benjamin Banneker Academy for Community Development.

After high school, Phara went on to attend SUNY Geneseo, where she majored in international relations. She then obtained an associate�s nursing degree at CUNY City Tech and a BSN at CUNY School of Professional Studies.

Before her political career, Phara held a variety of jobs that helped her connect with her constituents. She worked in New York City public schools, drove for Uber, and did youth advocacy work at Global Kids. She also worked as a maternal child field nurse, caring for new mothers after they gave birth.

In addition to her work as a nurse, Phara was president of her building�s tenant association before running for office. Tenant organizing, particularly the fight to pass the Housing Stability & Tenant Protection Act of 2019, was a major motivating force in her decision to run for office and stand up for tenants like her across the state.

Phara launched her campaign against incumbent Democrat Walter T. Mosley in the primary for the heavily Democratic 57th State Assembly district in August 2019. Her campaign emphasized support for decarceration, investment in public housing, and state-wide single-payer healthcare. During her campaign, she was endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Her campaign was funded entirely by the community, with no outside funding from corporations or businesses.

After trailing Mosley by 588 votes on election night in June 2020, Phara led Mosley by over 2,500 votes once absentee ballots were counted and was declared the winner. While Mosley remained on the general election ballot under the Working Families Party line, Phara won the November race with about 74% of the vote over Mosley's 26%.

In 2022, Phara was challenged by former District Leader and Community Board District Manager Olanike "Ola" Alabi in the Democratic primary. However, she successfully defended her seat and was unopposed in the general election.

Since being elected, Phara has continued to champion the rights of tenants, as well as expanding access to healthcare and reforms to the carceral system. In her first term, she passed the Less Is More Act, which made the state�s supervision system more just and equitable.

Phara believes that working-class New Yorkers deserve stable housing, affordable healthcare, and the resources to pursue a good life. She currently lives in Crown Heights with her husband and son.
