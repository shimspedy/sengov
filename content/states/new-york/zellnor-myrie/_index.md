Zellnor Myrie, born on November 3, 1986, is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He has been serving in the New York State Senate since 2019, representing the 20th state senate district, which includes parts of Brooklyn.

Myrie was born in Brooklyn, New York City to Costa Rican-born immigrant parents and raised in the Prospect Lefferts Gardens neighborhood. He graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School and attended Fordham University, earning his undergraduate and Master's degrees in urban studies.

Before law school, Myrie worked for the New York City Council as a legislative director where he helped draft the Tenant Bill of Rights. After graduate school, he earned his Juris Doctor from Cornell Law School where he served as student government president, prison law instructor, and pro bono scholar.

After law school, he joined Davis Polk & Wardwell. As an associate at the firm, Myrie worked more than 600 pro bono hours in one year. His pro bono work included cases brought by victims of police brutality, special education students seeking services from the Department of Education, domestic violence victims, and asylum seekers.

In the 2018 elections, Myrie ran for New York State Senate in the 20th district. He challenged Jesse Hamilton, a former member of the Independent Democratic Conference, in the Democratic Party primary election. Myrie defeated Hamilton in the September primary, earning 54% of the vote. Hamilton remained on the ballot in the November general election under the Independence and Women's Equality ballot lines, where Myrie defeated him again, earning over 92% of the vote.

Myrie is chairperson of the Elections Committee in the state senate. He is also a member of the Senate's consumer protection committee. Myrie supported the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019. He also sponsored legislation to ban most evictions during New York's COVID-19 state of emergency.

On May 30, 2020, Myrie was pepper-sprayed and handcuffed while taking part in protests following the murder of George Floyd. On October 29, 2021, six New York City firefighters were suspended for threatening the staff of Myrie in regards to his support of firing certain city employees who were unwilling to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Myrie supports financial institutions having the right to deny lending capital to ammunition and gun industries.
