Beatrice "Bea" Angela Duran is an American politician and union grievance specialist from Las Vegas, Nevada. She is currently serving as a member of the Nevada Assembly, representing the 11th district.

Bea Duran was born in 1963 in Cheyenne, Wyoming. In 1986, Duran, then a waitress at the Four Queens Hotel and Casino, became active in the Culinary Workers Union, the Las Vegas-based Local 226 of UNITE HERE, and was on staff as the union achieved recognition there. Since 1999, she has worked as a staff member for the Culinary Union, where she was a grievance specialist with their Culinary Grievance Department.

In December 2018, the Clark County Commission appointed Duran as a Democratic member to represent the 11th district (portions of Las Vegas and North Las Vegas) of the Nevada Assembly. This appointment was to replace Olivia Diaz, who had resigned from her Assembly seat soon after winning re-election, to run for the Las Vegas City Council.

Throughout her political career, Bea Duran has shown a strong commitment to her constituents and has worked tirelessly to represent their interests in the Nevada Assembly. Her background in the Culinary Workers Union has given her a unique perspective on labor issues, and she has used this experience to advocate for workers' rights in the Assembly.
