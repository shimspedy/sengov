After retiring from the police force, he shifted his focus to legal practice, particularly aiding Police Officers and Firefighters who had been injured or killed in the line of duty.

Elected to the Nevada Assembly in November 2022 to represent District 19, Yurek co-sponsored Assembly Bill 175 during his first term.

His contributions to legal scholarship include co-authoring a critique of the Automobile Exception in Nevada, reflecting his expertise in legal analysis.

Over the years, Yurek has received multiple honors for his service and leadership, including being named Officer of the Year by the Henderson/Green Valley Elks Lodge No. 2802 and Sworn Supervisor of the Year by the City of Henderson Police Department. He also received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Hope International University.

Toby is married to Carrie Yurek, a Marriage and Family Therapist Intern. They have three sons, TJ, Tyler, and Trey. The family is actively involved in their local church, and Toby enjoys outdoor activities such as camping and hunting.
