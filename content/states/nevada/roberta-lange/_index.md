Roberta Lange, born in 1957, is an American politician currently serving as a member of the Nevada Senate from the 7th district. She assumed office on November 4, 2020.

Lange was born in Lancaster, California and raised in Whitefish, Montana. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education from Los Angeles Baptist College and a teaching certificate in Kâ€“12 education from Pacific Lutheran University.

Before moving to Las Vegas in 1995, Lange worked as a teacher in Washington. During the 2006 Nevada gubernatorial election, she worked as the finance director for Dina Titus. She was also the Nevada state director for the Bill Richardson 2008 presidential campaign.

From 2011 to 2017, she served as the chair of the Nevada Democratic Party. She was also a member of the Democratic National Committee's executive committee. She was elected to the Nevada Senate in 2020 and also serves as vice chair of the Senate Legislative Operations and Elections Committee.

In addition to her political career, Lange is a retired teacher, a respected union leader, and the former three-term Chair of the Nevada Democratic Party. During her first term as Party Chair, she spearheaded in-state efforts to ensure that Nevada went blue for President Barack Obama.

Lange's career is marked by her dedication to public service and her commitment to improving the lives of the people of Nevada. Her work in the Nevada Senate continues to reflect these values.
