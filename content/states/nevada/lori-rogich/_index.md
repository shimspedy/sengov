Lori Rogich is a Republican member of the Nevada State Senate, representing District 11. She assumed office on November 6, 2024, and her current term is set to end on November 8, 2028.

Lori Rogich's journey to public service is deeply rooted in her personal and professional experiences. Her family history is a testament to resilience and determination. Her grandfather, an immigrant from Poland, built a life in the United States through hard work, eventually becoming a small business owner. This entrepreneurial spirit was passed down to Lori's mother, who successfully ran a tavern after years of working as a waitress. These family values of perseverance and ambition shaped Lori's character and inspired her to pursue her own version of the American Dream.

As a teenage parent, Lori faced significant challenges but remained steadfast in her commitment to education and self-improvement. She specialized in typing and stenography, which allowed her to secure a position at a prominent law firm. Encouraged by her colleagues, she pursued higher education at Rutgers University, graduating with high honors while balancing full-time work and parenting. Her determination led her to attend Rutgers Law School, where she earned her law degree after years of dedication and sacrifice.

In 2012, Lori founded the Rogich Law Firm, where she provided legal counsel and strategic planning for clients in regulated industries. Her expertise in law and her personal experiences as a parent navigating the education system fueled her passion for advocacy. She became a vocal supporter of educational reform, driven by her own encounters with challenges in the Clark County School District.

Lori's commitment to her community extends beyond her professional achievements. She has served on various committees, including the Cannabis Advisory Commission and the Education Transition Committee under Governor Joe Lombardo. Her work reflects her dedication to creating opportunities and addressing the needs of her constituents.

As a state senator, Lori Rogich continues to champion issues that matter to her district, leveraging her background and experiences to make a meaningful impact. Her story is one of resilience, hard work, and an unwavering commitment to public service.
