Nicole Cannizzaro is a dedicated public servant and a passionate advocate for the state of Nevada. Born and raised in Las Vegas, Nicole is a lifelong Nevadan. Her parents, who were proud members of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, came to Las Vegas to work in the hotels and casinos. Despite not having a lot of money, Nicole's family instilled in her the value of education from a young age.

Nicole is a product of Nevada’s public K-12 and higher education systems. She graduated from Chaparral High School and earned a Guinn Millennium Scholarship to attend college. Without that scholarship program and low in-state tuition rates, higher education would have been out of reach for her. Nicole earned a Bachelor’s in Business Administration from the University of Nevada, Reno. Following college, she moved back to Las Vegas, where she earned her law degree from the UNLV Boyd School of Law.

Upon graduation, Nicole began her legal career in private practice with a focus on civil litigation. However, her desire to serve the public led her to join the Clark County District Attorney’s Office in 2011. Over the years, Nicole has handled hundreds of cases, ranging from overseeing juvenile matters to handling cases of child abuse, sexual assault, homicide, and other violent crimes. She’s been an advocate for victims, a partner for law enforcement, and has helped make Clark County a safer place to live.

Nicole was first elected to the Nevada State Senate in 2016. During her time in the legislature, she has been a passionate advocate for our state’s most vulnerable communities, sponsoring legislation to protect senior citizens from elder abuse, crack down on domestic violence offenders, and eliminate barriers for disabled veterans to obtain medical treatment. She also took the lead on legislation to increase access to mental health services through mobile mental health units and provided more workplace protections for pregnant women. The majority of Nicole’s bills were passed with bipartisan support and, in her first-term, signed by a Republican Governor.

In 2019, Nicole made history by becoming the first woman elected to the position of Majority Leader of the State Senate in Nevada’s history. Nicole is married to her husband, Nate Ring. They live in Summerlin with their two dogs.
