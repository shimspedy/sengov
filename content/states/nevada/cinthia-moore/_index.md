As a legislator, Moore is passionate about addressing the needs of her constituents. She is committed to improving education, healthcare, and job opportunities for all Nevadans. She also champions reproductive rights and immigrant rights, striving to ensure that every voice in her community is heard and represented. Her vision for Nevada includes creating a more equitable and inclusive state where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
