Lesley E. Cohen was born on December 22, 1970, in New York City, U.S. She is a Democratic member of the Nevada Assembly, serving since 2016 and previously from 2013 until 2014.

Cohen's journey into politics began when the Clark County Commission appointed her to the Assembly after the resignation of April Mastroluca following the 2012 general election. However, Republican Stephen Silberkraus defeated Cohen in the 2014 general election by more than 1,300 votes. Undeterred, she retook the seat in the 2016 election by a margin of 212 votes.

In addition to her political career, Cohen is also a divorce attorney. After graduating from Valley High School in Las Vegas, she earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in political science from the University of Nevada, Reno, where she was a classmate of now-Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson. She completed a law degree at Depaul University College of Law in Chicago in 1996. Cohen also volunteers at Clark County Legal Services, demonstrating her commitment to community service.

Throughout her tenure, Cohen has served on various committees. In the 2023-2024 term, she was assigned to the Judiciary Committee, Natural Resources Committee (as Chair), and Revenue Committee. In the 2021-2022 term, she served on the Judiciary Committee, Natural Resources Committee (as Vice chair), and Revenue Committee (as Chair). In the 2019-2020 term, she served on the Judiciary Committee (as Vice chair), Health and Human Services Committee (as Chair), and Revenue Committee.

Cohen's career experience includes working as an attorney and a volunteer with Legal Aid of Southern Nevada. Her dedication to public service and her constituents is evident in her work and achievements. She continues to serve the people of Nevada with integrity and commitment.
