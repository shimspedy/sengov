Shea Backus is an American politician and attorney who is currently serving as a member of the Nevada Assembly from the 37th district. Born in 1975 in Las Vegas, Nevada, Shea is a third-generation Nevadan.

Shea's paternal great-grandparents traveled across the country to Eureka, Nevada for employment in the early 1900s. This is where Shea’s grandmother, a former educator, was born. Shea’s maternal grandfather moved his family to Las Vegas in the 50s as he had secured employment at the Nevada Test Site. Most of Shea's family continue to call Nevada home.

After graduating from Ed W. Clark High School in 1993, Shea earned a B.S. in management science from the University of California, San Diego in 1998. She then went on to earn both a Juris Doctor and Indian Law Certificate from the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University in 2003.

Shea has been a member of the State Bar of Nevada since 2003. In 2018, Shea was elected to the Nevada Assembly, representing the 37th district. Shea lives with her husband Marc, an airline pilot and a member of the Independent Pilots Association, and their dogs Vegas (17 1/2 year old Silky) and new puppy Carson.

Shea has a long record of giving back to her community and others. From her youth, she volunteered at an at-risk elementary school. In law school, Shea oversaw the Volunteer Income Tax Association. Today, Shea provides pro bono legal representation to abused and neglected children.

From personal life experiences, Shea understands the importance of access to health care. With Shea’s parents and in-laws aging, Shea recognizes the need for community and families to support our aging population. This also includes the need to insure our seniors are safe from those desiring to take advantage of them.

Shea is excited to be running for reelection to continue serving Assembly District 37. Shea wants to fight the good fight: for Nevadan children so that they benefit from a solid education, for Nevadans to continue to thrive from economic growth and clean energy, and for Nevadans to have access to affordable preventative and diagnostic health care.
