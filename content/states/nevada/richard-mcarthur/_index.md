Richard McArthur, born in 1943 in Lake Forest, Illinois, is a Republican member of the Nevada Assembly. He represents the 4th district, which covers parts of the northwestern Las Vegas Valley.

McArthur was first elected to the Nevada Assembly in 2008. However, he was defeated in his 2012 primary bid for the Nevada Senate. Despite this setback, he regained his Assembly seat in 2016 and has been serving since then. He assumed his current office on November 4, 2020.

Before his political career, McArthur served in the U.S. Air Force from 1966 to 1972, reaching the rank of captain. After his military service, he joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a Special Agent. His cases included bank robberies, kidnappings, foreign counterintelligence, bombings, and terrorism.

McArthur received his Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of California, Davis. He has established a strong presence in Assembly District 4, which comprises half of State Senate District 18, and has served in five legislative sessions and five special sessions.

On the personal front, McArthur has been married to his wife, Trish, for more than 48 years. They have two daughters, Kimberly and Michele, and five grandchildren.

In terms of political positions, McArthur supports the right to keep and bear arms. He advocates for the deportation of illegal immigrants residing in the state of Nevada. He also opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana, expressing his opposition to Nevada Question 2 (2016), which legalized recreational marijuana in the state. He was rated the most conservative member of the Assembly by the American Conservative Union in 2011.

As of 2024, McArthur is running for election to the Nevada State Senate to represent District 18. He is on the ballot in the Republican primary on June 11, 2024.
