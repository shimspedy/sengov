Sandra Jauregui is a prominent figure in the Nevada State Assembly, representing the 41st district. She is a member of the Democratic Party and has been serving in her current role since November 9, 2016. Her term is set to end on November 6, 2024.

Born on October 31, 1983, in Monterey Park, California, Sandra was raised in nearby Hacienda Heights. She identifies as Latina. Her journey in education began at Mt. San Antonio College, and she later graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

Before her political career, Sandra interned and worked for Representative Harry Reid as a foreclosure mitigation lead. She spent two years working directly with Nevada residents on housing and mortgage issues. This experience provided her with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by her constituents and equipped her with the skills to address these issues effectively.

In 2016, Sandra ran for the open seat vacated by the retiring Victoria A. Dooling. She defeated former Assemblyman Paul Aizley in the Democratic primary and Republican Nick Phillips in the general election. This victory marked the beginning of her political career in the Nevada State Assembly.

As an assembly member, Sandra has been involved in various legislative activities. One of her notable contributions is her sponsorship of AB291, a bill proposed to repeal state preemption laws concerning firearm ownership in Nevada. The bill also aimed to regulate the modification of semiautomatic firearms, including trigger mechanisms and bump stocks, and reduce the concentration of alcohol that may be present in the blood or breath of a person while in possession of a firearm.

Despite facing protests and controversy, Sandra's commitment to safety measures led to the bill being signed into law by Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak on June 14, 2019. This achievement is a testament to her dedication to creating a safer environment for the residents of Nevada.

In recognition of her leadership and contributions, Sandra was appointed as the Majority Leader of the Nevada Assembly in February 2023. As she continues to serve her constituents, Sandra Jauregui remains a strong advocate for the people of the 41st district and a respected member of the Nevada State Assembly.
