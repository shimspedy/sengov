Erica Roth is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the Nevada State Assembly, representing District 24. She assumed office on November 6, 2024, and her current term is set to end on November 4, 2026.

Erica Roth grew up in Northern Nevada, where her father, an elementary school teacher, and her mother, a member of United Scenic Artists Local 829 IATSE, instilled in her the values of collective action and service to others. These early influences shaped her career path and commitment to advocating for the rights of working families, seniors, and vulnerable members of the community.

Before her tenure in the Nevada State Assembly, Erica worked as a civil rights attorney and served as Deputy General Counsel for Governor Steve Sisolak. Her legal career has been marked by a dedication to protecting consumers from predatory corporations, defending tenants from unjust treatment, and advocating for comprehensive care for individuals experiencing mental illness. One of her most notable achievements was drafting an executive order in 2022 to protect abortion providers and patients in Nevada from criminal prosecution following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

As an Assemblymember, Erica Roth continues to champion issues such as housing as a human right, criminal justice reform, environmental justice, and reproductive freedom. She is deeply committed to creating policies that reflect the needs and voices of the people she represents. Outside of her professional life, Erica enjoys exploring the natural beauty of Northern Nevada with her rescue dog, Noah, and has fostered over ten rescue dogs, demonstrating her compassion and dedication to helping others in all aspects of her life.
