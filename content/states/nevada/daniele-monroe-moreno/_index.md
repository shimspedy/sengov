Daniele Monroe-Moreno was born in 1964 in Tucson, Arizona. She moved to Nevada in 1994 and has called District 1 home almost the entire time she has lived in Nevada. She began her life journey with her better half, Gary. Together, they have three beautifully accomplished daughters, two amazingly talented sons, seven adorable grandchildren, two dogs, and various grandpets.

Monroe-Moreno worked for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and later as a corrections officer for the North Las Vegas Police Department. She was a member of the North Las Vegas Steering Committee from 2000 until 2002. She served as second vice chair of the Clark County Democratic Party from 2011 until 2015, and was elected to the Assembly in 2016.

In April 2017, Monroe-Moreno introduced a bill in the Assembly which would ban private prisons in the state. Despite it passing in both the House and Senate, the bill was vetoed by Governor Brian Sandoval. In March 2023, Monroe-Moreno, a moderate, was elected chair of the Nevada Democratic Party beating incumbent Judith Whitmer, a progressive. Monroe-Moreno is the first Black woman to chair the Nevada Democratic Party.

Monroe-Moreno has three daughters; Candace, Cassandra, and Celena and two step-sons; Colin and Aaron, and six grandchildren. Monroe-Moreno supports increasing the minimum wage. She also supports increased funding for behavior and mental health programs.

The residents of Nevadaâ€™s Assembly District #1 first elected Daniele to represent them in 2016. Today, she proudly serves them as the Assistant Majority Leader. She is a history maker, being the first African American Female to ever hold a leadership position in the Nevada State Assembly and is the current Chair of the Nevada Black Legislative Caucus.
