Robin L. Titus was born on February 21, 1954, in Trenton, New Jersey. She completed her high school education at Smith Valley High School, graduating in 1972. Following her high school graduation, she attended the University of Nevada, Reno, where she received a Bachelor of Science in 1976. She furthered her education by becoming a Doctor of Medicine (MD) from the University of Nevada School of Medicine in Reno, Nevada in 1981.

Dr. Titus is not only a politician but also a practicing physician in Lyon County, Nevada. In 1989, she had an office in Wellington and another one in Yerington. However, she had to stop delivering babies when the insurance premiums were raised and she could no longer afford them. Despite this, by 2014, she still maintained a medical practice in Wellington.

Her political career began when she served as a Republican member of the Nevada Assembly, where she represented District 38. She also held the position of Minority Leader of the Nevada Assembly from June 4, 2019, to November 9, 2022. She was succeeded by P. K. O'Neill in this role.

On November 8, 2022, Dr. Titus ran for election to the Nevada State Senate to represent District 17 and won. She assumed office on November 9, 2022, succeeding James Settelmeyer. Currently, she serves as a Republican member of the Nevada Senate representing the 17th district.

Apart from her medical and political careers, Dr. Titus is also the president of the Smith Valley Historical Society. On a personal note, she is married to Allen Veil, who previously served as the sheriff of Lyon County. They have two children and reside in Wellington, Nevada.
