Assemblywoman Clara "Claire" Thomas is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Nevada Assembly from the 17th district. She was first elected to the Nevada Assembly in November 2020.

Claire was born in Tifton, Georgia. She moved to Southern Nevada in 1982 while serving in the United States Air Force as an air traffic controller. After 20 years of honorable service, she retired from the Air Force and decided to settle in Las Vegas.

Claire is a proud and honorably retired United States Air Force military veteran. During her retirement from the USAF, while working two jobs at times, attending school full-time and being a divorced single mom, she earned a master’s degree in public administration; BA in Psychology from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) and an associate degree in Social Services from the College of Southern Nevada, (CSN).

She has lived in Las Vegas for the past forty-one years and raised two children who are lifelong Nevadans. Her accomplished children Edina, daughter the married mother of four, and her son Eric who works for Clark County and is a volunteer track coach for Centennial High School, have made the Valley their home.

Claire is a proud grandmother of four beautiful, active grandchildren Ayden, William, Madden, and Virginia who are the apple of her eye. Her son-in-law William Flaathen is a member of the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 525.

During the 2021-2022 81st Session, she served on the Government Affairs Committee, Health and Human Services Committee, and Legislative Operations and Elections Committee. In the 2022 Interim, she serves on the Education Committee and Substance Use Response Working Group (SURG) – Chair sub-committee on Treatment and Recovery. She also serves on the Nevada Commission on Aging, Advisory Board on Maternal and Child Health, and Advisory Committee for a Veterans Cemetery in Southern Nevada.

Claire's legislative history includes sponsoring and passing into law several bills including AB119 - Revises provisions relating to the Maternal Mortality Review Committee, AB343 - Revises provisions governing certain regional transportation commissions, and AB344 - Authorizes the establishment of a program to facilitate transition of the care of older persons and persons with disabilities.

Her interests include reading about World and U.S. History, local and national political issues, education, and family and church activities. She is an active member in her community with Little League Baseball as a volunteer Mom, supporter, and a Cheer athletic competition supporter.
