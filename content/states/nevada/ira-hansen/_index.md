Ira Hansen, born on October 5, 1960, is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He has been serving as a member of the Nevada State Senate for the 14th district since 2018. Prior to this, he represented the Nevada Assembly's 32nd district from 2010 to 2018.

Hansen was born in Reno, Nevada, and attended local Washoe County schools. During his time at Sparks High School, he met his future wife, Alexis Lloyd. As of 2014, they have been married for 34 years and have eight children.

In 1986, at the age of 26, Hansen started his own plumbing company. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and has been involved in the community as a Sparks Little League coach, a Sparks Pop Warner coach, and as a Scoutmaster for the Boy Scouts of America. He is a third-generation Eagle Scout, and all of his four sons are Eagle Scouts.

Hansen was an opinion columnist for the Sparks Tribune and was previously a talk radio host on station KKOH in Reno for five years and later for 99.1 KKFT. He is a lifetime member of Nevada Bighorns Unlimited, the NRA, and other sportsmen and gun rights groups. His website states that he believes in "constitutionally limited government, lower taxes, and individual responsibility". He has been a proponent of states rights and has opposed what he believes is overreach by the Bureau of Land Management and other federal agencies.

Hansen has been an advocate for the construction industry by calling for a reform to Nevada's construction defect laws which he believes hurt the Nevada construction industry and are only benefiting attorneys who "have boasted that they have grossed over a billion dollars in construction defect claims." Hansen is an advocate for the mining industry and says on his website that "mining is the bedrock of Nevada's rural economy even today". He is a member of the Nevada Renewable Energy Coalition and believes in using renewable energy sources to create jobs.

Hansen was elected to the Nevada Assembly in 2010 and re-elected in 2012 and 2014. Hansen's aunt, Janine Hansen, is a perennial candidate under the conservative Independent American Party of Nevada. Hansen, who has stated that his aunt's efforts damage the Republican Party, has been reported to leave committee hearings when she gives testimony.

Hansen currently serves as the Chairman of the Nevada Assembly's Judiciary Committee. In the 5 years he's held office Hansen has built an impressive legislative record. In 2011 Hansen codified his reputation as a 2nd Amendment leader by authoring AB217 which repealed restrictions on some firearm sales.
