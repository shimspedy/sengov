Carrie A. Buck was born on July 19, 1971, in Sioux City, Iowa. She is an American educator and politician currently serving as a Republican member of the Nevada Senate. She represents the 5th district, which covers parts of Henderson and Paradise to the south of Las Vegas in Clark County.

Buck received a bachelor's of science degree in elementary education from Montana State University in 1995. She then went on to receive a master's degree in administration and supervision from the University of Phoenix in 1998 and a doctorate degree in organizational leadership from NOVA Southeastern University in 2006.

She began her career in education in 1996, teaching English as a second language students at an elementary school in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2005, she became the principal of C.T. Sewell Elementary School in Henderson, Nevada, which was then one of the lowest-performing elementary schools in Nevada. Under her leadership, the school saw increased test scores in both math and English and won a Milken Educator Award when the school became a National Title I School.

In 2014, she became principal of the Pinecrest Academy, a charter school in Henderson. She also became president of the Pinecrest Foundation, a non-profit focusing on providing funding for charter school initiatives.

Buck first became involved in politics in 2016, when she ran against incumbent Joyce Woodhouse in the 2016 Nevada State Senate elections as the Republican candidate for the 5th district. She lost by fewer than 500 votes and was considered as a potential candidate to replace Woodhouse in 2017 in a potential recall, but the effort failed to gain traction.

By narrowly defeating Democratic opponent Kristee Watson, Buck became the only candidate to flip a State Senate seat from Democratic to Republican in the 2020 Nevada State Senate elections. As a state Representative, Buck has proposed a bill that would have offered up to $10 million in tax credits for charter school donors to better fund facilities at Title I public charter schools.

Currently, she is serving as the Assistant Minority Leader in the Nevada State Senate.
