Fabian Doñate is a member of the Nevada State Senate, representing District 10. He assumed office on February 4, 2021, and his current term ends on November 4, 2026. He was appointed to District 10 by the Clark County Commission on February 2, 2021, following the resignation of Yvanna Cancela (D). He was sworn in on February 4, 2021.

Doñate was born in Los Angeles, California. He was the first person in his family to graduate from college. He earned a B.S. in public health from the University of Nevada at Las Vegas in 2018 and a master's degree in healthcare administration from the University of Maryland in 2020.

His career experience includes working as a development consultant with the University of Maryland School of Public Health, the regional account management coordinator with the American Cancer Society, and a health policy research assistant with the Center for Latino Prosperity.

In the 2023-2024 legislative session, Doñate was assigned to the following committees: Senate Education Committee, Senate Health and Human Services Committee (Chair), and Revenue and Economic Development Committee (Vice Chair). In the 2021-2022 session, he was assigned to the Senate Education Committee and the Senate Natural Resources Committee (Chair).

Doñate ran for re-election to the Nevada State Senate to represent District 10 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. He defeated Philip Graviet and Chris Cunningham, securing 55.5% of the votes.

Growing up in Las Vegas, Doñate believes that a job is more than just a paycheck. It’s dignity in what we do and security for our families. As the son of immigrants and union members (Culinary and UFCW), he wants to ensure that anyone willing to work hard and play by the rules has an opportunity to succeed.
