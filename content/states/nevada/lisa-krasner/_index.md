Born in California, Lisa was the first in her family to attend and graduate from a four-year university and receive a Bachelor’s Degree, as well as the first in her family to receive a Doctorate degree. She earned her Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of La Verne College of Law.

Lisa's love for education led her to join the faculty of the University of Phoenix, teaching courses on Political Science, the United States Constitution, NV Constitution, Advocacy & Mediation, State & Local Political Processes, Critical Thinking, and Business Law. She currently teaches U.S. Constitution and NV Constitution courses in the Political Science Department at Truckee Meadows Community College.

Lisa believes in creating strong communities. She served as a Commissioner on the State of Nevada Commission On Aging and Disability for three years. She worked on legislation that helped our community’s senior citizens with the issues that are important to them. Lisa also served as a Commissioner for the City of Reno’s Recreation and Parks Commission for seven years, where she advocated for a family-friendly environment in the City of Reno.

Through her love of the arts, Lisa served on the Reno Philharmonic Association Board of Trustees and as the President of the Reno Philharmonic Guild. Lisa cares about education. She was an active participant in her children’s public schools for their entire education. Lisa volunteered in the classroom, teaching Junior Achievement.

Lisa Krasner first ran for the Assembly in 2014 against incumbent Randy Kirner. While she finished second in the Republican primary, she advanced to the general election because no Democratic or Independent American candidates declared and no primary candidate received more than 50% of the vote. In the general election, Krasner lost by a mere 11 votes. In 2015, Krasner announced she would run for the NV State Assembly. She won the Republican primary and ran unopposed in the general election, garnering more than 30,000 votes from all party affiliations. Lisa Krasner assumed office as the Assemblywoman for Nevada State Assembly District 26 on November 9, 2016.
