Bert Gurr, born in 1948 in Roosevelt, Utah, is an American politician and a member of the Nevada Legislature. A Republican, he represents Nevada's 33rd district. He has lived in Nevada since 1949 and has strong ties to the community and state.

As a small business owner and community leader, Bert has a long history of putting Nevada and his community first. An active participant in legislative and political activities at the state and local level, Bert is committed to moving Nevada forward through commonsense policies.

From 1970 through 1977, he worked with Area West on the Spring Creek Development, beginning as a laborer, and working up to Project Manager. After obtaining his real estate broker’s license in 1979, Bert went on to form several land companies and, eventually, his own brokerage office.
