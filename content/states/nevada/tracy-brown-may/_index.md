Tracy Brown-May, born in 1967, is an American politician currently serving as a member of the Nevada Assembly from the 42nd district. She was appointed to the seat after the incumbent Democrat Alexander Assefa resigned.

Born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and raised in Ware, Massachusetts, Tracy moved to Las Vegas after graduating from Ware Junior Senior High School. She earned an associate degree in political science and government from the College of Southern Nevada in 2015 and is currently enrolled as a student at Northeastern University.

Tracy pursued photography immediately after high school but shifted gears after realizing the challenges of making a living in the field. She worked in the gaming industry in Las Vegas and later began a career at Opportunity Village, a nonprofit serving people with disabilities through respite care, job training, and enrichment programs.

From 1996 to 2001, Tracy was the employee development manager of Sam's Town Hotel and Gambling Hall. In 2001, she joined Opportunity Village as a special assistant to the president and CEO. Since 2017, she has worked as the organization's director of advocacy and government relations chair.

Tracy is a passionate advocate and a champion of the people. She is determined to help create better jobs, a stronger economy, high-quality education for all students, access to housing for all Nevadans, and a robust healthcare system that focuses on wellness and health. Tracy is a longtime disability advocate and has seen firsthand the incredible value of workforce development. She has spent the last 20+ years engaged in community building, disability support services, and systems advocacy.
