Brian Hibbetts is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Nevada State Assembly, representing District 13. He was born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he grew up in a working-class family. From a young age, Brian learned the value of hard work and serving your neighbor from his parents.

At the age of 15, Brian started volunteering with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) Explorer program where he developed a passion for helping others. This passion led him to join LVMPD full-time in 1994. During his tenure, he quickly rose through the ranks and committed himself to protecting our communities and enforcing and implementing our laws.

After retiring from the force in 2021, Brian has continued to serve his community in various capacities. He co-founded and has served as the director of Ex-Con Inc. NV, a non-profit organization. He has also been a volunteer with Just 1 Project, J4NG, and LIT Life.

In 2022, Brian decided to take his commitment to public service to the next level by running for the Nevada State Assembly. He was elected to represent District 13 and assumed office on November 9, 2022. His current term ends on November 6, 2024.

As a legislator, Brian is committed to keeping our communities safe; promoting school choice for students and parents; strengthening our economy through economic diversity and fighting against job-killing legislation; and protecting our individual freedoms. He is a member of several committees including the Government Affairs Committee, Health and Human Services Committee, and Legislative Operations and Elections Committee.

Brian Hibbetts is a proven leader who is dedicated to making Nevada a better place for all its residents. He is running for re-election to continue his work in the Nevada State Assembly.
