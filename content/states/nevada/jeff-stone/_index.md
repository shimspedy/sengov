Jeffrey Earle Stone, born on January 30, 1956, is an American politician and pharmacist. He is currently serving as a member of the Nevada State Senate since 2022. A member of the Republican Party, Stone represented California's 28th State Senatorial district in the California State Senate, which encompassed parts of Riverside County at the time.

Stone was born and raised in Los Angeles County, California. He earned a Doctor of Pharmacy degree from the USC School of Pharmacy. After earning his pharmacy degree, Stone relocated to Temecula, California, and opened a small business. He served as a member of the Temecula City Council before being elected to the Riverside County Board of Supervisors.

In the 2014 general election, he defeated former Assemblywoman Bonnie Garcia, another Republican. Stone is Jewish. He was the only Republican member of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus until he resigned from the caucus, saying it was preoccupied with criticizing President Donald Trump. He resigned the same day the Jewish Caucus released a statement condemning President Trump's response to the white supremacist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.

In 2016, Stone was the Republican nominee for California's 36th congressional district, but he lost the general election to Raul Ruiz by a wide margin. He was narrowly re-elected to the Senate in 2018. He resigned on November 1, 2019, after accepting an appointment with the U.S. Department of Labor to become its Western Regional Director.

After a special election held on May 13, 2020, Stone was succeeded in the State Senate by Republican Assemblywoman, Melissa Melendez. Stone had previously purchased a home in Henderson, Nevada. In 2022, he announced his candidacy for Nevada's 20th state Senate district. Following his successful election, Stone became a Nevada senator in November 2022 encompassing the southeastern corner of the state.
