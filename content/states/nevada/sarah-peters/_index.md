Sarah Peters is an American politician and environmental engineer serving as a member of the Nevada Assembly. She represents the 24th district, which includes Downtown Reno, Nevada.

Born in 1987 in Silver City, Nevada, Sarah Peters earned a Bachelor of Science in environmental engineering from the University of Nevada, Reno. After her graduation, she worked as a project manager and was the vice-chair and secretary of the Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration's Reno chapter.

She is the vice chair of the Health and Human Services committee and sits on two other committees.

In March 2021, she came out publicly as pansexual on the floor of the Nevada Assembly as a part of a speech in support of the Nevada Equal Rights Amendment. Peters told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that at first, because she had a husband and children, she did not speak about her pansexuality, but she later changed her opinion, believing it was an opportunity to come out and
