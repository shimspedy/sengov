Prior to her appointment to the legislature, Harris served with the Nevada Public Utilities Commission as an administrative attorney.

Harris is openly gay and is one of four openly LGBT members of the Nevada state legislature, alongside senators David Parks, Pat Spearman and Melanie Scheible. She is a strong advocate for criminal justice reform, LGBTQ issues, and uplifting the voices of underserved communities.

In addition to her political career, Harris is also a lawyer. She has been serving in the Nevada State Senate since 2018 and her current term ends in 2024. She is running for re-election to continue representing District 11.

Harris has been assigned to several committees during her tenure. In the 2023-2024 term, she was assigned to the Finance Committee, Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee (as Chair), and Senate Judiciary Committee. In the previous terms, she served on the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, Senate Education Committee, and Senate Natural Resources Committee.

Outside of her political career, Harris is a martial arts master and co-founded Nevada's LGBTQ caucus. She represents District 11 in Clark County and parts of Las Vegas. She serves as chief majority whip in the Nevada State Senate and is one of only four out LGBTQ+ lawmakers in the legislature.

Harris is a dedicated public servant and a strong advocate for her constituents. Her commitment to public service and her passion for justice and equality make her a respected figure in Nevada politics.
