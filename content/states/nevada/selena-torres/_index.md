Selena Torres is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She represents the 3rd district in the Nevada State Assembly. Born in 1995 in Las Vegas, Nevada, she is a proud product of Nevada's public education system. She attended Clark County School District for K-12, The College of Southern Nevada, and received her Bachelorâ€™s in English Literature at the University of Nevada, Reno. In December 2019, Selena graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with her Master's in Education.

Her parents, who fled the Salvadoran civil war and left Hawaii to pursue a career in education, instilled in her the values of hard-work, education, and the importance of giving back to her community. Their family made Assembly District 3 their home due to its diversity that reflected their own family.

In 2018, Selena ran for election to represent District 3 in the Nevada State Assembly, replacing Nelson Araujo, who was leaving the seat to run for Secretary of State. She won the election with 66.5% of the vote. As an assemblywoman, Selena serves on several Assembly committees including Education, Judiciary, Legislative Operations and Elections. She is currently serving as Vice Chair of Government Affairs and is a member of the Education and Legislative Operations and Elections committees. Selena is currently chair of the Nevada Hispanic Legislative Caucus.

In addition to her political career, Selena is an educator and continues to work as a public school teacher. She founded the Cesar Chavez Day, Las Vegas festival seven years ago which created a scholarship to encourage high school participants to pursue higher education. Her dedication to education and her community is evident in her work and service.
