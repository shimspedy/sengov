Melanie Scheible is an American politician and attorney who is currently serving as a member of the Nevada Senate. She was born on May 27, 1989, in Sacramento, California, and was raised in Reno, Nevada.

Scheible pursued her early education in Reno and graduated from Reno High School. She then went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in public policy from Stanford University. Following her undergraduate studies, she attended Columbia Law School where she earned her Juris Doctor degree. During her time in law school, Scheible interned at the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office.

After completing her education, Scheible began her career as a deputy district attorney in Clark County, a position she continues to hold while out of session. Her political career took off when she was elected to represent the 9th district of the Nevada Senate in 2018. The 9th district includes southwestern suburbs of Las Vegas in Clark County, including most of Enterprise and parts of Summerlin South and Spring Valley.

In addition to her role as a senator, Scheible has been assigned to various committees throughout her tenure. These include the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate Natural Resources Committee. As of 2023-2024, she serves as the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Vice Chair of the Senate Natural Resources Committee.

Scheible is openly bisexual and is one of five openly-LGBT members of the Nevada Legislature. In her free time, she enjoys volunteering for politics, the LGBTQ community, and her local food bank.
