Michelle Suzanne Gorelow, born in 1971, is an American politician serving as a member of the Nevada Assembly from the 35th district. She was born in Decatur, Indiana. She earned a B.A. in biology from Wilmington College in Wilmington, Ohio and an M.Ed. in education from the University of Phoenix in Las Vegas.

Michelle has been and is involved with multiple initiatives to improve the health of children in Nevada. She has served on the Nevada Maternal and Child Health Coalition Steering Committee since 2008, and served as co-chair from 2014 to 2018. She also served on the Nevada Governor’s Association Improving Birth Outcomes from 2013 to 2016.

In 2018, Michelle was elected to the Nevada Assembly, where she has been representing the 35th district since November 7, 2018. She ran for re-election in 2022 and won, her current term ends on November 6, 2024.

Michelle has dedicated her career to creating opportunities for families to live their healthiest lives. Right after she graduated from Wilmington College, she was selected for a Gift of Sight mission to the Philippines and spent two weeks working with a team of optical professionals to provide eye exams and glasses to more than 14,000 people in need.

During her career, she’s worked for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, March of Dimes, and Positively Kids. Even though the mission of each organization is different, hers was not: to work diligently to improve the health of every member of our community. It was this drive that motivated her to run for Assembly in 2018 and 2020, and to run for re-election in 2022.

As an Assemblywoman, she was proud to support legislation that ensures no Nevadan would be charged more for health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, end surprise billing, and establish a maternal mortality review committee so that Nevada’s moms and babies have a healthy start.

Michelle Gorelow is married to Andrew Gorelow. They have two children.
