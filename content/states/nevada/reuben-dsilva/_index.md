Reuben D'Silva, born in 1985 in Mumbai, India, is an American politician currently serving as a member of the Nevada Assembly from the 28th district. He immigrated to the United States as a toddler and attended Rancho High School where he served as Senior Class President and graduated in 2003.

After high school, he attended the College of Southern Nevada (then Community College of Southern Nevada) and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. While attending the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), Reuben was called to serve his country and deployed to Iraq. On the night of June 6th, 2007 while serving as a turret gunner in Fallujah, Reuben's convoy came under enemy fire. He was shot through the forearm but still managed to return fire and suppress the enemy until his fellow Marines could escape the kill zone.

For his heroics in defending American Freedom, Reuben was awarded both the Purple Heart and Naval Achievement Medal. However, he spent the following year in a military hospital recovering from his wounds. After his rehabilitation and medical discharge from the Marine Corps, Reuben returned to Las Vegas and graduated from UNLV with a bachelor's degree in History.

He then earned his first masterâ€™s degree in Global Studies at the University of Pennsylvania and earned a second master's degree in Comparative Religion and Politics at Yale University. He graduated from Yale University and turned down several out-of-state job opportunities so he could return to Las Vegas and teach History at his alma mater, Rancho High School, feeling it was the right thing to do.

At Rancho, Reuben coaches girls' basketball, advises several clubs, and promotes college, career, and civic readiness in his classroom. He is one of Rancho's most beloved teachers, having a reputation for being a tough, yet compassionate educator. Reuben has positively impacted hundreds of lives.

Reuben knew he wanted to be a high school teacher. Having turned down several out-of-state job opportunities, he came back to teach at the same high school he attended so he could help inner-city kids like himself, get an education and achieve their dreams. As a teacher, Reuben inspires and motivates a new generation every day.

Reuben and his family faced hurdles similar to that of many of his students, as working-class immigrants struggling to make it in America. As an academic mentor and role model, he has motivated hundreds to pursue higher education and give back to their communities. He has led and organized community events in Nevada, California, Arizona, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Louisiana, Georgia, Arkansas, Washington DC, and Virginia. He served as Western Regional Director of Social Action for Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., as well as the Alumni Director of Education.
