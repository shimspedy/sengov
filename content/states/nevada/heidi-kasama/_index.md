Born in New York City, New York, Kasama now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada. She graduated from Edmonds Woodway High School in 1977 and earned a Bachelor's degree in Accounting from Central Washington University.

Before her political career, Kasama started her professional journey as a Certified Public Accountant. In 2001, she became a full-time real estate agent and went on to start her real estate brokerage in 2004, which quickly rose to 80 full-time agents. She has served as President of the Nevada Realtors and the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. Currently, she is the managing broker of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties and manages Kasama Property Management.

In the Nevada State Assembly, Kasama has been assigned to several committees including the Commerce and Labor Committee, Judiciary Committee, Revenue Committee, Growth and Infrastructure Committee, and Ways and Means Committee.

In August 2023, Kasama announced her candidacy for Nevada's 3rd congressional district in the 2024 United States House of Representatives elections, but later opted to run for re-election instead.
