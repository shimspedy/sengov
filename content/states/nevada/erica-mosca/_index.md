Erica Mosca is an American politician and teacher, currently serving in the Nevada Assembly. She is a member of the Democratic Party and represents parts of Las Vegas. Notably, she is the first Filipina legislator in Nevada.

Born in San Diego, California, Erica now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada. She is a proud first-generation college graduate and the daughter of a Filipino immigrant. Erica is known by many in the community as “Ms. Mosca,” and is a strong advocate for social justice.

She was part of the college access non-profit 10,000 Degrees in high school and served as a fifth-grade teacher with Teach For America, Las Vegas. Through these experiences, she witnessed educational inequity in both her personal and professional life. This led her to dedicate herself to empowering change from the community, for the community, to ensure students can play the game to change the game to upend structural inequity and systemic racism.

In 2008, Erica graduated Summa Cum Laude from Boston University and moved to Las Vegas to teach 5th grade in East Las Vegas. She made her classroom theme “Leaders in Training” to empower equitable opportunity for students from a similar background as herself.

In 2012, when her former 5th graders started high school, Erica started “Leaders in Training” as an official non-profit organization with her own savings. Today, Leaders in Training empowers over 200 students annually with a 100% college acceptance rate, 81% postsecondary persistence rate including 20 different institutions in 8 states from NYU, University of Michigan to USC and all of our NV schools and 100% of members committing to use their education and success to empower their home community.

Erica earned a B.S. from Boston University, an M.Ed. from the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, and an Ed.M. from Harvard University. Her career experience includes working as a consultant. Erica founded Leaders in Training.

She has served on US Congressman Steven Horsford's Equity Cabinet, the NV State Public Charter School Authority appointed by the NV State Board of Education and supported national US Air Force Spouse initiatives as an enlisted military spouse. Recently, Erica has served as a Founding Board member of Opportunity House to ensure low-barrier housing for unhoused youth, on the Board of Trustees of college access high school Cristo Rey St. Viator & as the Academic Committee Chair, the Board Chair of college persistence program & housing complex Q3 Student Partners' Community Advisory Board and served on the Clark County Community Development Advisory Committee appointed by Commissioner Justin Jones.
