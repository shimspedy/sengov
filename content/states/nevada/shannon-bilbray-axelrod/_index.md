Shannon Mary Bilbray-Axelrod, born in 1973, is a Democratic member of the Nevada Assembly. She represents the 34th district, which covers parts of the western Las Vegas Valley.

Bilbray-Axelrod is a third-generation Nevadan born in Las Vegas. She graduated from the University of San Diego where she studied political science and government. She is the daughter of former U.S. Representative James Bilbray, and her sister, Erin Bilbray, was an unsuccessful 2014 candidate for Nevada's 3rd congressional district.

She got her political start after college working for Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin's first Representativeial campaign. She interned in the Clinton White House and then-Sen. Joe Biden's office, and was Congresswoman Dina Titus' liaison for veteran's affairs, environmental, and education issues from 2009 to 2011.

Bilbray-Axelrod ran for the Assembly in 2016, prevailing in a three-way Democratic primary and defeating Republican Matt Williams in the general election. She worked as the director of new business development for Organized Karma, a lobbying, marketing and campaign strategy firm. Her biggest project there had centered around the 100th anniversary of the park system -- "showing how important the park system is to this nation and why it's so important to keep it up," she said.

In March 2017, in accordance with Federal law and as a requirement of all employees of Organized Karma, it was reported Bilbray-Axelrod had registered in 2016 as a foreign agent on behalf of Saudi Arabia. This was in order for Organized Karma to legally represent a client wishing to lobby against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.

Bilbray-Axelrod and her husband, Danny Axelrod, have a daughter, Molly.

Bilbray-Axelrod supports legalization of marijuana, and supports universal background checks for gun purchases. As a Nevada Assemblywoman, Bilbray-Axelrod has served on Assembly committees for Government Affairs, Legislative Operations and Elections, Transportation, Growth and Infrastructure, and Judiciary. Additionally, she has served as Vice-Chair of Natural Resources Committee and Chair of the Education Committee.

Bilbray-Axelrod sponsored the bill that became law banning marriage for people under the age of 18 in Nevada. Bilbray-Axelrod has also questioned a proposal that would limit the powers of four new, non-voting members of the Clark County school board.
