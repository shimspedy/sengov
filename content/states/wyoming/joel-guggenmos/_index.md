Joel Guggenmos, a member of the Republican Party, serves in the Wyoming House of Representatives, representing District 55. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to conclude on January 4, 2027.

Born in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, Joel Guggenmos moved to Riverton, Wyoming, as a child, where his father established a church. Over the years, he has become deeply rooted in the Riverton community, spending the majority of his life there. Joel has a background in residential construction and is also a small business owner, which has given him firsthand experience with the challenges and opportunities faced by local entrepreneurs and workers.

Joel's journey into politics began with a strong desire to represent the values and concerns of his constituents. In the 2024 elections, he successfully ran for the Wyoming House of Representatives, defeating the incumbent Ember Oakley in the Republican primary. His campaign focused on issues such as property tax reform, parental rights, and preserving Wyoming's lands and resources. Joel is a staunch advocate for traditional family values, education reform, and safeguarding individual freedoms.

Outside of his political career, Joel is a devoted husband and father. He and his wife, Beth, are raising their son, Anthony, in Riverton, where they cherish the close-knit community and the natural beauty of Wyoming. Joel's commitment to his family and his faith continues to inspire his work as a legislator, as he strives to make a positive impact on the lives of the people he represents.
