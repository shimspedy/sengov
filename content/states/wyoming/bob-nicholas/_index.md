Robert A. Nicholas (born October 14, 1957) is an American Republican politician. He is currently a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives from the 7th district. A lawyer by profession, Nicholas was first elected from the 8th district in November 2010, taking office early the next year.

**Early life and career**
Born in Lander, Wyoming, Nicholas graduated from the University of Wyoming with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1982, followed three years later with a degree from the University of Wyoming College of Law. Nicholas first ran for the 8th district in 2008 and lost to the incumbent Lori Millin, but he succeeded two years later. During his campaign, he emphasized economic growth, smaller government, and environmental protections as his priorities, and he also wanted to push for a pilot charter school in Laramie County.

On November 23, 2011, Nicholas was arrested in Boca Grande, Florida on the felony charge that he had assaulted his 19-year-old, mentally disabled son outside a restaurant. The charges were subsequently dropped upon review by the Florida State Attorney's office because of "insufficient evidence."

Nicholas considers himself a fiscal conservative who supports cuts in the state bureaucracy and increases in the rainy day fund to an amount equal to two years of current state spending. He indicated that he could support a small increase in the gasoline tax to fund highway projects.

In 2012, Nicholas worked on a juvenile justice bill that would increase the confidentiality for young persons charged in criminal cases. He was reported as supporting changes in the educational system with less reliance on standardized testing.

Nicholas was opposed in the August 2012 Republican primary by Keith Eldred and Margaret Wall. In the general election, Nicholas faced Kathleen Peterson.

**Personal life**
A widower, Nicholas has three children. He is a Catholic and lives in Cheyenne. His brother, Phil Nicholas, is a state senator.
