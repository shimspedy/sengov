Cyrus Western, a Republican politician, has been serving as a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives from the 51st district since 2019.

## Education and Background

Western's journey began with a Bachelor's degree in environmental science from Washington & Jefferson College in 2012. His commitment to environmental issues led him to pursue further studies, and he obtained a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies with a focus on environmental science from Harvard University in 2016.

## Political Career

In November 2018, Western secured a seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives, representing the 51st district. His uncontested victory in the general election allowed him to assume office and start making an impact on Wyoming's legislative landscape.

## Controversy and Redemption

Western faced criticism for a tweet he posted in December 2020. In response to an article about the appointment of Wyoming's first African-American sheriff, Aaron Appelhans, Western used a GIF from the film "Blazing Saddles" that included insensitive stereotypes. After realizing the mistake, Western promptly deleted the tweet and personally apologized to Sheriff Appelhans. Despite the controversy, Western remained committed to his role as a representative and continued to serve his constituents.

## Legislative Initiatives

One of Western's notable legislative efforts is House Bill 84, also known as the Naomi Hunting Age Exemption Act. Inspired by a Make-A-Wish child named Naomi, who dreamed of going big game hunting, this bill seeks to waive Wyoming's age requirements for children with terminal illnesses. By allowing these children to experience hunting, Western aims to create meaningful memories and provide a sense of joy during challenging times.

## Personal Life

Cyrus Western resides in Big Horn, Wyoming, and holds strong Christian beliefs. His dedication to public service and his commitment to making a positive impact continue to shape his work as a representative for the people of Wyoming.
