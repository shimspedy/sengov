Cale Case (born June 2, 1958) is a Republican member of the Wyoming State Senate. He has held this position since 1999. Prior to that, from 1994 to 1998, he served as a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives. Case is known for his contrarian and libertarian views. He endorsed Ron Paul in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries. Throughout his political career, he has been a longtime chairman of the Senate Corporations, Elections, and Political Subdivisions Committee. In the state Senate, Case represents Fremont County District 25, which includes an area along the Wind River Front, including Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho constituencies. Despite being a strong opponent of tax increases, Case supported a 2019 bill that would have created a corporate income tax targeted mostly at big-box stores (although the legislation did not pass). He has also been a leading proponent of higher taxes on wind energy. Additionally, Case voted against legislation that would have forbidden Wyoming from recognizing same-sex marriages legally made in other states or countries. He supported 2021 legislation to abolish capital punishment in Wyoming. Case's educational background includes a B.A. and Ph.D. in economics from the University of Wyoming at Laramie. He currently works as an economist and consultant.
