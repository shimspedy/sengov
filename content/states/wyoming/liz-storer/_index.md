Liz Storer's love for Wyoming began during her childhood. Her grandfather, George B. Storer, a broadcasting pioneer, owned a ranch near Saratoga in the 1950s. Liz spent summers there, surrounded by the majestic mountains and the vast open sky. Her father taught her to fish, and she attended camp in the Tetons. Later, she became a fishing guide on the upper North Platte River. In 1997, Liz made history as the first woman to represent the US Fly Fishing team during the championship held in Jackson.

## Advocacy and Leadership

Liz's commitment to Wyoming extends beyond her personal experiences. She believes that many of Teton County's challenges are rooted in state policy and require state-level solutions. Issues like rapidly increasing property taxes, growth pressure, and the housing crisis have their origins in Wyoming's current tax structure. Liz advocates for greater flexibility and local input in shaping the state's destiny.

## Bipartisan Engagement

Liz's leadership extends to bipartisan efforts. She has served on the Board of the Ruckelshaus Institute of Natural Resources at the University of Wyoming and participated in statewide task forces appointed by both Democratic and Republican governors. Her experience on Gov. Jim Geringer's State Trust Land Task Force provided valuable insights into land management. Liz emphasizes that there are better ways to raise funds for education without compromising community values.

## Philanthropy and Public Policy

Liz leads her family's foundation, the George B. Storer Foundation, which has supported conservation and education initiatives in Wyoming and beyond for over 65 years. Her bipartisan approach allows her to advocate for Teton County while building alliances across the aisle. Liz champions economic diversification, sustainable communities, and an engaged citizenry throughout Wyoming.
