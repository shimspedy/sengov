Elections :
- In 2012, Hutchings won the Republican Primary for District 42 with 679 votes (36.7%) and secured victory in the November 2012 General election with 2,833 votes (68.0%) against Democratic Party candidate Gary Datus.
- In 2010, she initially challenged District 7 incumbent Republican Representative Bryan Pedersen but lost in the Republican Primary. Pedersen held the seat until 2013.

Controversial Comments :
- Hutchings generated controversy in February 2019 when she compared homosexuality to bestiality/pedophilia while meeting with a group of young people from their school's gay-straight alliance. The students were lobbying support for legislation to protect LGBTQ people from job and hiring discrimination. The bill ultimately failed in the Wyoming House of Representatives.
- She also argued that without the death penalty, Jesus Christ would not have been able to die to absolve the sins of mankind, advocating for the maintenance of capital punishment.
