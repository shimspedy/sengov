Marlene Brady is a Republican member of the Wyoming House of Representatives, representing District 60. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Marlene Brady has deep roots in Wyoming, having lived in Green River for over 45 years. She earned her bachelor's degree in sociology and social science, as well as a master's degree in public administration and political science, both from the University of Wyoming. Her academic background reflects her commitment to understanding societal structures and governance, which she brings to her role as a legislator.

Before entering politics, Marlene dedicated nearly 17 years to serving veterans, a role she found deeply fulfilling. Her husband, Dell, has managed a local family business for over four decades, and together they raised two children. The couple also homeschooled their children, a decision they hold dear. Marlene's family-oriented values and strong belief in community have shaped her approach to public service.

Marlene Brady's campaign emphasized returning authority to the people, aligning with her belief in limited government and constitutional principles. Her dedication to these ideals resonated with voters, leading to her election victory in 2024. As a representative, she is committed to advocating for the rights and interests of her constituents in District 60, ensuring their voices are heard in the legislative process.
