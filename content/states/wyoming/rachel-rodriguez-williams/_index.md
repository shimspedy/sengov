Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, an American Republican politician and businesswoman, has made significant contributions to Wyoming's political landscape. Elected in November 2020, she assumed office as a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives from the 50th district on January 4, 2021.

## Early Life and Education

A native of Northern California, Rodriguez-Williams pursued her education with determination. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in criminal justice and law enforcement administration from Sonoma State University. Her passion for justice and public service led her to further her studies, and she obtained a Master of Science in criminal justice from Columbia Southern University.

## Career Path

Rodriguez-Williams began her professional journey as a law enforcement officer in Marin County. However, her path took an unexpected turn when she moved to Cody, Wyoming, in 2007. Her commitment to community welfare and her desire to make a difference led her to engage actively in Wyoming's political arena.

## Political Career

In a closely contested race, Rodriguez-Williams emerged victorious in the 2020 election for the Wyoming House of Representatives. She secured an impressive 77% of the votes, defeating her opponent, Johnson Bennett. The 50th district she represents includes the cities of Ralston, Heart Mountain, Sunlight, Crandall, the Willwood area south of Powell, and the eastern part of Cody.

## Legislative Impact

During her tenure, Rodriguez-Williams championed important causes. She sponsored House Bill 175, which aimed to provide suicide awareness and prevention programs to Wyoming students in grades six through 12. Although the bill did not pass, her commitment to mental health advocacy remains unwavering.

Additionally, Rodriguez-Williams played a role in naming a state-owned office building in Casper. While she supported naming it after former Wyoming representative John S. Wold, the bill ultimately failed, and the building was named after Thyra Thomson, who served as the Secretary of State of Wyoming from 1963 to 1987.

In 2023, Rodriguez-Williams sponsored H.B. 152, known as the Life Is a Human Right Act. This legislation sought to make surgical and medication-assisted abortions illegal in Wyoming. Her stance reflects her dedication to protecting the sanctity of life.

## Beyond Politics

Apart from her legislative work, Rodriguez-Williams is a member of WYCAN (Wyoming Citizens Against Normalization), a group committed to prohibiting cannabis products in Wyoming.

Rachel Rodriguez-Williams continues to serve her constituents with integrity, compassion, and a strong sense of purpose. Her journey from California to Wyoming exemplifies the power of determination and the impact one individual can make in shaping their community.
