Laurie Bratten's journey into politics is deeply rooted in her diverse professional and personal experiences. Born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, she pursued her education at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in Education with a focus on Biological Science in 1983. Her early career saw her as a high school science teacher, a role that allowed her to combine her passion for education and science.

After starting a family, Laurie made the decision to step away from her professional career to focus on raising her children.

Her responsibilities ranged from legislative analysis to communications, showcasing her versatility and dedication to public service.

Laurie's move to Wyoming in 2017 marked a new chapter in her life. Settling in Sheridan County with her husband, Rich, she immersed herself in the local community. Together, they worked on improving their property, engaging in agricultural activities, and contributing to the local economy. Laurie also earned the Wyoming Master Gardener designation, further solidifying her connection to the land and its people.

Her commitment to traditional values and the principles of the Code of the West resonated with her neighbors and constituents. This dedication was evident in her election as the Treasurer/Secretary of a local ditch company, a role that underscores the importance of water rights in Wyoming. Laurie's active participation in civic organizations, such as the Sheridan County Republican Women and the Big Horn Woman's Club, highlights her dedication to community service and advocacy.

Laurie Bratten's political career is a testament to her unwavering commitment to her constituents and the values she holds dear. Her journey from educator to legislator reflects a life dedicated to service, family, and the betterment of her community.
