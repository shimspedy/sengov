## Early Life and Education

Karlee was born in Pueblo, Colorado. Her journey to becoming a legislator is marked by determination and hard work. At the age of 16, she left home and school, facing challenges head-on. Through sheer determination, piles of student debt, and the unwavering support of those who believed in her, Karlee defied the odds. She went on to earn her Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology and Law from the University of Wyoming.

## Career and Advocacy

Karlee's obsession with justice has driven her research on the psychology of the American legal system. As an instructor at the University of Wyoming since 2017, she delves into decision-making processes in police use-of-force cases. Her work contributes to a deeper understanding of how justice is administered and how it can be improved.

Beyond academia, Karlee is a co-founder of Albany County for Proper Policing (ACOPP). This organization was born out of tragedy when Robbie Ramirez was murdered by an Albany County sheriff's deputy following a traffic stop. Karlee and other members of the Laramie community founded ACOPP to advocate for proper policing practices and accountability.

## Legislative Contributions

Karlee Provenza's commitment extends to her legislative work. Here are some bills she sponsored in 2021:

2. **HB0206 Wyoming Minimum Wage**: Advocating for fair wages.
3. **HB0212 Expungement for Restoration of Rights**: Focusing on criminal justice reform.
