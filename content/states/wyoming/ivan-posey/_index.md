Ivan Posey is a Democratic Party member serving in the Wyoming House of Representatives. He represents District 33, having assumed office on January 6, 2025. His current term is set to conclude on January 4, 2027.

Ivan Posey has a rich background that reflects his deep connection to his community and his commitment to public service. Born and raised on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, he is an enrolled member of the Eastern Shoshone tribe and also has Northern Cheyenne and Northern Arapaho heritage. His career has been marked by a dedication to education, cultural preservation, and tribal advocacy. Before entering the legislature, Posey worked as the Tribal Education Coordinator at Central Wyoming College and served as the culture director for Arapahoe School in Fremont County School District #38.

Poseyâ€™s leadership extends beyond his professional roles. He was appointed by Governor Dave Freudenthal to serve as the first Tribal Liaison for the Shoshone and Arapaho Tribes of the Wind River Indian Reservation from 2003 to 2004. Additionally, he served on the Shoshone Business Council for multiple terms, from 1994 to 2002 and again from 2004 to 2016. His efforts in community development include founding the Eastern Shoshone Boys and Girls Club and serving as chairman of the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council.

Throughout his career, Posey has been affiliated with organizations such as Americans for Indian Opportunity, Advancement for Indigenous Opportunity International, the Wind River Development Fund, and Community Entry Services. His work with these groups highlights his commitment to fostering opportunities and improving the quality of life for Indigenous communities.

In the 2024 elections, Posey defeated the incumbent Republican Sarah Penn to secure his seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives. His victory marked a significant milestone, as he became the only Native American or Indigenous member of the 68th Wyoming Legislature. This achievement underscores his role as a representative voice for his community and a champion for the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples in Wyoming.
