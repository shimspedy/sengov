Barry Crago, a dedicated public servant, has made significant contributions to Wyoming's political landscape. Born and raised on a family ranch in Belle Fourche, South Dakota, Barry developed a love for ranching and a strong work ethic. His journey led him to the University of Wyoming, where he earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural business in 1999.

## Legal Pursuits and Public Service

Barry's passion for law and public service prompted him to intern for United States Senator Craig Thomas in Washington, D.C. Following this experience, he returned to Wyoming to pursue a law degree. In 2004, he received his Juris Doctor from the University of Wyoming College of Law. His legal career includes serving as a judicial law clerk to Judge Clarence Brimmer of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming.

Currently, Barry wears multiple hats. He serves as Deputy County Attorney in Johnson County, Wyoming, and is a partner at Crago Law Offices. Additionally, he manages the Willow Creek Ranch outside of Kaycee, Wyoming. His commitment to public service extends to the political arena, where he represents House District 40 as a Republican legislator, covering Johnson and Sheridan counties.

## Family and Community

Barry's personal life is equally fulfilling. He and his wife, Kristen, have two daughters, Lily and Caroline. Their family values and dedication to Wyoming shine through Barry's work and service.
