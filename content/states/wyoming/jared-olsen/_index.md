Jared Olsen is a Republican member of the Wyoming State Senate, representing District 8. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 1, 2029.

Jared Olsen is a fourth-generation Wyomingite deeply committed to preserving the values and traditions of his home state. Born and raised in Evanston, Wyoming, he has built a life centered on family, community, and public service. Jared is a devoted husband and father of three children, Eden, Noah, and Abel. He resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where he also runs a successful law firm dedicated to serving families, businesses, and community organizations.

Before joining the Wyoming State Senate, Jared served in the Wyoming House of Representatives, representing District 11 from 2017 to 2025. During his tenure in the House, he held several leadership roles, including Majority Whip, and chaired key committees such as the House Judiciary Committee and the Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology, and Digital Innovation. His legislative work has focused on ensuring fair elections, advocating for justice system reforms, and promoting economic diversification through innovation.

Jared's educational background is equally impressive. He is the first in his family to graduate from college, earning a Bachelor of Science in Political Science, a Master of Public Administration, and a Juris Doctor degree, all from the University of Wyoming. His journey from a modest upbringing, with a mother who worked tirelessly as a waitress and cook to support her five children, to becoming a respected attorney and legislator, is a testament to his dedication and work ethic.

Throughout his career, Jared has remained steadfast in his commitment to the people of Wyoming. He believes in listening to his constituents, working hard on their behalf, and ensuring that future generations inherit a state that is even better than the one he grew up in. His priorities include strengthening education, fostering economic growth, and upholding the values of independence, responsibility, and honesty that define Wyoming's character.
