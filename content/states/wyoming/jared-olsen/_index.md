Jared Olsen is a devoted husband and father of three - Eden, Noah, and Abel. He is a small businessman and attorney who operates a thriving law firm in downtown Cheyenne, dedicated to helping Wyoming families, businesses, the elderly, and community partners. Jared believes in raising his children with Wyoming values: independence, responsibility, honesty, and hard work.

First elected to the Wyoming State Legislature in 2016, Jared's focus is on the people of House District 11. He stands against special interests and prioritizes being your voice. As Chairman of the House Corporations, Elections, and Political Subdivisions Committee, he ensures fair and safe elections. Jared has also served on various committees, including Appropriations and the Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology, and Digital Innovation.

Jared is a proud graduate of the University of Wyoming College of Law and holds a Master's of Public Administration from the same institution. His commitment to education stems from his humble background, where his mother worked as a waitress and cook while raising five children. Jared's goal is to leave an even better Wyoming for future generations.
