Charles K. Scott (born August 19, 1945) is a Republican member of the Wyoming Senate, representing the 30th district since 1983. Previously, he served in the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1979 to 1982. During 1993-1994, he held the position of vice president of the Senate. His current term ends on January 6, 2025. Scott earned his B.A. from Harvard College in 1967 and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1969. In 2016, he secured re-election by defeating Democratic opponent Robert Ford with a substantial margin of 5,831 votes to 1,521 (79.3% - 20.7%). Notably, in 2012, Scott sponsored a resolution (SJR 3) aimed at ensuring "health-care freedom" through an amendment to the state constitution. Additionally, in February 2022, he advocated for a budget amendment to eliminate the University of Wyoming Gender Studies program, citing concerns about its ideological bias.
