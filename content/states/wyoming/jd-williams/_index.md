J.D. Williams is a Republican member of the Wyoming House of Representatives, representing District 2. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, J.D. Williams pursued his education at the University of Wyoming, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Economics in 1997. His professional background is deeply rooted in ranching, a career that has not only shaped his understanding of Wyoming's agricultural landscape but also informed his approach to policymaking. Williams is known for his commitment to the values and needs of his constituents, particularly those in Goshen, Niobrara, and Weston Counties, which make up District 2.

Williams first entered the Wyoming House of Representatives in 2021, when he was appointed to fill a vacancy left by Hans Hunt. During his initial tenure, he served until January 2023, after which he briefly stepped away. However, his dedication to public service and his community led him to run for election in 2024, where he successfully reclaimed his seat. His return to the House underscores his enduring commitment to addressing the challenges faced by his district and the state of Wyoming as a whole.

Throughout his legislative career, Williams has been an active participant in various committees, focusing on issues such as travel, recreation, wildlife, and cultural resources. His work in these areas reflects his deep connection to Wyoming's natural heritage and his desire to preserve and enhance it for future generations. As a legislator, he has been a vocal advocate for policies that support rural communities, promote economic development, and uphold the values of hard work and self-reliance that define Wyoming's spirit.

Outside of his political and professional life, J.D. Williams is a family man, deeply rooted in his community. His experiences as a rancher and a legislator have given him a unique perspective on the interplay between local traditions and the broader challenges of governance. Williams continues to serve with a focus on fostering a prosperous and sustainable future for his district and the state of Wyoming.
