Darius Kila is an American politician who is currently serving in the Hawaii House of Representatives for the 44th district, which includes Honokai Hale, Nanakuli, and Maili. He won the seat in the 2022 election against Republican opponent Kimberly Kopetseg.

Born and raised on the leeward coast of Oahu, Kila graduated from Kapolei High School in 2013. He furthered his education at several institutions, including Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee; Fullerton College in Fullerton, California; and Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon.

Before his political career, Kila served as a community liaison for Representative Stacelynn Kehaulani Eli, his predecessor in the Hawaii House of Representatives. He was also a member of the Nanakuli-Maili Neighborhood Board and an advocate for the Council of Native Hawaiian Advancement.

In 2022, Kila was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives District 44, defeating Republican Kimberly Kopetseg. In his first legislative session, Kila introduced a resolution that was successfully adopted by the state Legislature to form a working group to address Native Hawaiian intellectual property rights. His other legislative priorities include supporting Native Hawaiian and rural communities and kalo farmers.

Kila currently resides in Māʻili, Oʻahu. He earned a B.A. in communication and media studies from Southern Oregon University in 2020. His career experience includes working as a legislative aide with the Hawaii State Legislature and a lead host with RAM Restaurant Group. Kila has served on the board of the Nānākuli-Māʻili Neighborhood Board and as the care advocate team lead of the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement.
