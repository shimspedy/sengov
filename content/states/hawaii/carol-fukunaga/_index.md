Senator Carol Fukunaga returned to the State Senate in November 2022, and currently serves as Vice-Chair of the Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection. She also as a member on the committees on Energy, Economic Development (EET), Higher Education (HRE) and Public Safety, Intergovernmental and Military Affairs (PSM).

Fukunaga represents Hawaii's 11th Senatorial District and served in the Hawaii State Senate between 1992-2012; the district currently includes Manoa, Makiki/Punchbowl, Papakolea, Tantalus and the University region. A member of the William Shaw Richardson Law School's inaugural class (1973-1976), she has made a lifelong commitment to public service since the 1978 Constitutional Convention. She champions public access, economic diversification (particularly for women and AANHA communities), and the use of tech tools to solve community problems.
