Born in ‘Aiea to a single mother and raised by Filipino immigrant grandparents, Brandon learned the values of commitment and responsibility at an early age. He was also taught about respect, the importance of hard work, and the value of community through his extended family.

After graduating from ‘Aiea High School, Brandon sought to explore beyond what Hawai‘i had to offer. He decided to attend Saint Mary’s College of California, where he discovered his passion for public service. He served as a resident advisor to his peers in the dormitories, and cofounded the Hawai‘i Club, where he later served as president. He received numerous awards for his dedication to student affairs and community service.

Upon graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and Business Administration, Brandon moved back home and taught social justice and world religions at Damien Memorial School. He also became active in his community once again, serving on the ‘Aiea Neighborhood Board, and eventually became a staff assistant to Hawai‘i State Senator Will Espero.

From 2011 to 2014, Brandon began working as a legislative aide to Honolulu City Councilmember Breene Harimoto. He assisted the Councilmember with tracking and following infrastructure and development projects as well as handling constituent issues in the ‘Aiea, Pearl City and Waipahū communities. This experience solidified his commitment to public service to serve the people of Hawai‘i.

Brandon is currently the Vice Chair for the Water and Land (WTL) committee and the Public Safety and Intergovernmental and Military Affairs (PSM) committee, as well as a member of the Judiciary (JDC) committee and Transportation and Culture and the Arts (TCA) committee. He is also the Co-Chair of the Joint Crime and Justice Caucus and a member of the Filipino Caucus.
