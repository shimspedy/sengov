Born and raised on O‘ahu, Representative Tina Nakada Gradinetti is driven by a deep love for the lands, waters, and people of Hawaiʻi. Her commitment to building a better future for the islands and its people have led her to pursue a career focused on crafting housing and land policy that keeps local communities together and protects and preserves our environment.

A proud product of Hawaiʻiʻs public schools, Representative Grandinetti graduated from Mililani High School and went on to receive her MA at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa and her PhD from RMIT University in Australia. In her doctoral research she focused on Hawaiʻi's housing crisis and spent months interviewing and learning from working families and people experiencing homelessness on Oʻahu. Her experience quickly taught her that solutions to Hawaiʻi's most pressing issues will come when we listen to, empower, and honor the expertise of the people who are most impacted. As a community leader, she was also active in the island-wide fight to protect Oʻahu’s aquifer in the aftermath of the Red Hill fuel leaks. She also serves as Vice President of Hawaiʻi Peace and Justice.

As a newly-elected lawmaker, she is proud and excited to serve District 20 and the people of Hawai‘i. She believes in politics that put people before profit, and care for ʻāina as the heart and soul of our island community.
