For the 2023 legislative session, Rep. Tarnas serves as the Chair of the Hawai'i State House Committee on Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs. As Chair, Rep.

Rep. Tarnas is a professional environmental planner with a local firm that he and his wife Carolyn formed to provide community planning, natural resource management, watershed management planning, impact analysis, permitting, compliance monitoring, reporting, government and community relations. For more than two decades, Rep. Tarnas has worked as a planning consultant and meeting facilitator on projects in Hawai'i to develop harbors, highways, farms, ranches, fishponds, and forest plantations, as well as scientific research facilities and renewable energy projects.

Rep. Tarnas is co-author of the Hawai'i Ocean Resources Management Plan (1990), co-founding board member of Malama Kai Foundation, former UH Sea Grant Extension Agent for West Hawai'i, and author of Act 306, the 1998 law which created the West Hawai'i Regional Fishery Management Area.
