Representative Natalia Hussey-Burdick was born, raised, and schooled in Kailua. With her mother, Ramona Hussey, being a founding member of the Green Party of Hawaiʻi, and her father, Alan Burdick, being a life-long and active member of the Democratic Party, Representative Hussey-Burdick has never been a stranger to talks about politics around the kitchen table growing up.

Representative Hussey-Burdick was educated at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa where she received a B.A in Biology. Her plan after college was to go on to medical school and become a doctor, allowing her to pursue her passion for science and helping people. After graduation, however, she was offered an opportunity to work at the State Legislature where she discovered her true passion, public policy. Since then she has served in a variety of capacities, including most recently as member of the Reapportionment Commission for the City and County of Honolulu representing Windward Oʻahu.
