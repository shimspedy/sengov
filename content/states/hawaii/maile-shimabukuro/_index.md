Aloha! My name is Maile Shimabukuro, and I currently serve as State Senator for District 22, which encompasses Ko Olina to Kaena on Oahu's leeward side.

I was first elected to the State House of Representatives in 2003, representing Waianae, Makaha, and Makua. In 2010, I had the fortune of being appointed to replace then Senate President Colleen Hanabusa when she was elected to Congress. I have served in the State Senate ever since.

I have served as Chair of the Hawaiian Affairs Committee since 2013. I am also a member of the Ways and Means, and Health & Human Services Committees.

In addition to serving as a legislator, I am an attorney at a non-profit legal services office, and I represent clients in primarily family and public benefit cases. I am a proud graduate of Nanaikapono Protestant Church Preschool, Maili Bible, Wai‘anae Elementary, Our Lady of Sorrows, ‘Iolani, Colorado College, and the University of Hawai‘i William S. Richardson School of Law.

I am half Okinawan and half Chinese, and I grew up on the Wai‘anae Coast. I have a son, Keani, and six stepchildren - Amber, Kekai, Christopher, Emma, Jaedyn, and Tyce.

I am the proud daughter of Karen Young, formerly a nurse practitioner at Wai‘anae Coast Comprehensive Health Center (or "WCCHC"), and James Shimabukuro, a professor at Kapi‘olani Community College. My sister, Summer Barrett, is an administrator at Leeward Community College; my half-sister, Elizabeth Durrough, is an HR Specialist at Target; and my half-brother, Robert Shimabukuro, is a mental health worker at Trillium Family Services. My stepfather, Dr. Fred Dodge, passed away on 04/03/22, and formerly served as medical director and a family physician at WCCHC.

My interests include surfing, health, politics, and travel.
