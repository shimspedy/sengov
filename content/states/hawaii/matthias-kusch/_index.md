Proudly calling Hawaii home for 35 years, I have deep roots in District 1, where my wife and I have raised our three daughters, all of whom attended public schools. As a retiree of the Hawaii Fire Department, I have been honored with Sayar Awards for bravery and meritorious service. I am also a dedicated Union member with 29 years of service and a lifelong Democrat.

My extensive community service includes leadership roles with various organizations, over two decades of farming experience, and advocacy for affordable housing. Through these efforts, I have built strong relationships with our Hawaii Island House and Senate delegation. I believe that my unique experiences and commitment to our community position me well to advance the interests of District 1, Hawaii Island, and the future of our state.
