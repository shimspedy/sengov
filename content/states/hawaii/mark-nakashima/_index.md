As a former educator, Representative Nakashima understands how critical it is to evaluate program budget requests, and to set criteria for the evaluation of these appropriations. Mark will work towards the development of geothermal energy statewide as a solution to breaking the State's dependence on imported oil. Representative Nakashima will also work to create a synergy between the Big Island community, public schools and institutions of higher learning to become more collaborative, and he will continue to work with all stakeholders to develop a vision that will guide long-term decision making and future expenditures.
Representative Nakashima is a graduate of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and holds a B.Ed. degree and Professional Diploma in education with an emphasis in political science.
