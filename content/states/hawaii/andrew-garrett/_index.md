Representative Andrew Takuya Garrett represents House District 22, which includes Manoa and parts of Tantalus and McCully-Moiliili. He currently serves as the Vice Chair of the Committee on Labor & Government Operations and is a member of the Committee on Finance and Committee on Culture, Arts & International Affairs.

Prior to being elected in 2022, Representative Garrett served as a member of Governor Ige's Cabinet as the deputy director of the department of human resources development. Prior to that, he spent several years with the Healthcare Association of Hawaii as its vice president of post-acute care.

Representative Garrett was born and raised in Camp Zama, Japan, a US Army base in Tokyo, and moved to Mililani, Hawaii when he was 11. He is a proud graduate of Mililani High School and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science and master's degree in public administration.

A resident of Manoa for 15 years and counting, his hobbies include traveling with his family and spending time with his 4 dogs and 4 cats, all from the local shelter.
