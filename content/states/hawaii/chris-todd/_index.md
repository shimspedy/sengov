Representative Chris Toshiro Todd is currently in his fourth term representing House District 3, which covers a portion of Hilo, Keaukaha, Orchidlands Estate, ‘Āinaloa, Hawaiian Acres, Fern Acres, portions of Kurtistown and Kea‘au in the Hawai‘i State Legislature.

Born and raised in Hilo, Representative Todd is a graduate of the University of Hawai‘i at Hilo with a bachelor's degree in economics and political science. He previously held several positions at Suisan Fish Market and Hawai‘i Paper Products in 2016 before being appointed by Governor David Ige on January 5, 2017 to fill the vacancy caused by the passing of the late Representative Clift Tsuji.

In his own words, Representative Todd is "incredibly grateful for this opportunity to serve my community." He remains deeply committed to advocating for working families at the Capitol. As a husband and a father, Representative Todd is also passionate about creating pathways for local youth, both in Hilo and across the state, to reach their professional and personal dreams.
