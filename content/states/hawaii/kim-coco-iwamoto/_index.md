Representative Kim Coco Iwamoto (District 25) is a public interest attorney, community activist, small business owner and founder of the Chamber of Sustainable Commerce. She served as a member of the Board of Education and the Hawaiʻi Civil Rights Commission. Rep. Iwamoto is our first openly transgender legislator in the State of Hawaiʻi.

Kim Coco Iwamoto is a trailblazing American politician from Hawaii, currently serving as a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives. Born on May 26, 1968, in Kauai, Hawaii, Iwamoto has made significant strides in her career, becoming the first transgender state legislator in Hawaii's history. Her journey is marked by her dedication to civil rights, education, and advocacy for marginalized communities.

Iwamoto's early life was shaped by her Japanese heritage and her upbringing on the island of Kauai. Her mother went into labor at a private party hosted by Grace Guslander, who was celebrating the expansion of her Coco Palms Resort. Iwamoto was born the next day, and Guslander visited her mother in the hospital with a bouquet of flowers, a card, and a request to name Iwamoto "Coco" after her hotel.

Iwamoto's educational journey began at Kaimukī Community Christian Pre-School on Oʻahu, followed by Hōkūlani Elementary School, Aliʻiōlani Elementary School, and Hanahauʻoli School. She later attended and graduated from Saint Louis School in 1986. She went on to earn an Associate of Arts in Merchandising from the Fashion Institute of Technology, a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing from San Francisco State University, and a Juris Doctor from the University of New Mexico School of Law. In 2011, Iwamoto completed Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a David Bohnett Foundation LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow.

Iwamoto's career is marked by her commitment to civil rights and education. She served as a commissioner on the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission and was elected to serve two terms on the Hawaii Board of Education. In 2013, President Barack Obama recognized her as a Champion of Change for her efforts in advocating for LGBTQ rights. In 2018, Newsweek listed her as one of fifty need-to-know pioneers for LGBTQ rights.

In addition to her work in civil rights and education, Iwamoto has been an active participant in political and social movements. She was one of the Democratic primary candidates for the position of Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in the 2018 election. In September 2024, Iwamoto and nine others were arrested and cited for alleged obstruction at a protest at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children during a management lockout of unionized nurses. The charges were later dismissed.

Iwamoto's family history is deeply rooted in Hawaii. Her paternal great-grandparents left Japan to work in the sugar cane plantations of Kauaʻi. Her paternal grandmother met her paternal grandfather at Tip-Top Restaurant on Kauai, where she was working as a cashier. The two used their family cars to start a taxi company, which eventually expanded into a tour company and a rental car company. Iwamoto's father began working for the family business in high school as a car washer, and their collective efforts became known as Roberts Hawaii. Iwamoto's maternal grandparents left Japan to grow cantaloupe and other produce in Imperial Valley, California.

Throughout her career, Iwamoto has been a vocal advocate for the rights of marginalized communities. She has worked tirelessly to protect LGBTQ students from bullying, expand the rights of LGBTQ families, and elevate LGBTQ leaders through her involvement with the Victory Institute. Her dedication to social justice and equality has made her a respected figure in Hawaii politics and a role model for future generations.

Iwamoto's personal life is equally inspiring. She is a single mother, raising her daughter while balancing her career and advocacy work. Her resilience and determination have earned her the respect and admiration of her peers and constituents alike.

Kim Coco Iwamoto's journey is a testament to her unwavering commitment to civil rights, education, and social justice. Her contributions to Hawaii and the broader LGBTQ community have left an indelible mark, and her legacy continues to inspire and empower others.
