Kyle Yamashita was born in Pukalani, HI. He attended Leeward Community College. Yamashita's career experience includes owning and operating a small business. He has been a member of the Parent Teacher Student Association at King Kekaulike High School and a scoutmaster for Pukalani Troop 75. He was elected to the Hawaii State House of Representatives in 2004. Representative Yamashita has served the residents of House District 12 [Pukalani, Makawao, Olinda, Pulehu, Kula, Ulupalakua] since his election in 2004. Recently, Sprecklesville has been added to House District 12 in the 2012 Reapportionment.

During his time in office, Hawaii faced its most serious economic crisis in recent history. Representative Yamashita was able to assist in crafting a balanced State budget without raising the general excise tax, and more important for Maui residents, without taking away Maui's portion of the state hotel room tax. As Chair of the Finance Committee, he continues to be committed to economic growth, especially by balancing the needs of business and labor.
