Representative Marten has spent her first three years learning, forming relationships and fighting for issues important to the well-being of our District and our State by writing and passing legislation, supporting legislation of others, directing State and Federal funds to District needs, advocating on behalf of the community with the military, and connecting homeless in our district with shelter and other services. She serves as the Vice-Chair of Education, Co-Convener of the Keiki Caucus, and a member of the Hawaiian Caucus, Environmental Caucus, Women's Caucus, and Kupuna Caucus. She is also the State Lead for Hawai ªi of the National Conference of Environmental Legislators, and a member of the Hawaii Invasive Species Council.

Legislation / budget provisions she is particularly grateful to have passed includes better funding and community involvement in reforming Child Welfare Services, new mental health services for children and adolescents, measures to address resale of stolen bicycles and other items, protecting women from domestic violence, promoting agriculture, fighting invasive pests, and preparation for changes in status of land used by the military.

Rep Marten is a proud grad of Kailua Intermediate and Kalaheo High School, Pitzer College, Harvard Public Policy (MPP), and Columbia Public Health (DrPH). Representative Marten has dedicated her career to serving communities' Environmental and Public Health. As a community member she has successfully fought for laws to protect beach parks and neighborhoods from over-commercialization, to create local clean energy jobs, and to improve traffic safety. Rep Marten served on the Kailua Neighborhood Board and Lanikai Association, conducted research at UH Med School and founded a non-profit focused on climate change education and community forestry. She is honored to represent and support the communities of Waimanalo and Kailua. She would love to hear from you!
