Elected in 2002, Representative Scott Y. Nishimoto proudly serves House District 23, which includes Ala Moana, Kaheka, McCully, Moiliili, and Kapahulu. Born in Honolulu, Scott attended Manoa Elementary School, St. Louis School, and graduated from Mid-Pacific Institute. While earning his Bachelors in Sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, he served as the Student Body President. Thereafter, Scott attended the William S. Richardson School of Law, where he earned a Juris Doctor in 2002. Before holding public office, Scott worked as a staff member in the Washington, D.C. office of U.S. Senator Daniel K. Inouye.

Over his 20 years of service at the legislature, Scott has served as Chair of House Judiciary, Chair of Higher Education, Chair of Legislative Management, Chair of the Subcommittee on Grants-in-Aid, Vice Chair of the House Finance, and Chair of the Subcommittee on Capital Improvement Projects.

Scott is committed to maintaining a close relationship with the community. He serves on the UH College of Arts and Sciences Alumni Association Board, and Diamond Head Theatre Community Advisory Board. He is a member of the Diamond Head Lions Club and the Kapahulu-Moiliili Lions Club. In 2016, Scott was awarded the Dean's Alumnus of the Year by the UH William S. Richardson School of Law for his dedication to public service. In 2018, he was recognized as one of the Legislators of the Year by the Healthcare Association of Hawaii for his work in supporting Hawaii's healthcare workers. Most recently, Scott was honored with the award of 2019 Legislator of the Year by the Friends of the Library of Hawaii for his commitment to improving, supporting, and strengthening the Hawaii State Library Systems.

Scott's leadership has been recognized both nationally and within the Asia-Pacific region. In 2012, the National Guard Association of the United States awarded Scott the Patrick Henry Award, which recognizes local officials and civic leaders who have shown outstanding and exceptional service to the Armed Forces or National Guard. Scott also serves as a Council Leader on the U.S. Japan Council, a non-profit organization that contributes to strengthening U.S.-Japan relations. He has the distinction of being the first Anheuser-Busch/Frank Horton Fellow with the Asian Pacific American Institute of Congressional Studies, and in 2013 was honored with the organization's Trailblazer Award in recognition of his achievements in public service.
