Representative Daniel Holt is dedicated to making the community, where he was born and raised, as well as the entire State of Hawai'i, a better place to live for all its residents. He is privileged to represent House District 28, which encompasses Palama, Sand Island, Iwilei, and Chinatown and currently serves as the Chairman of the Committee on Economic Development.

Representative Holt is also a member of the House Committees on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs and the Committee on Tourism. Since Representative Holt’s first term as a legislator, he has taken a strong stance against crime and continues to advocate for increased funding for social services who assist our most vulnerable populations. Now in his fourth term as an elected official, he continues to be committed to fighting for safer communities for the people of Hawai'i and advocate for Native Hawaiians as Co-Chair of the Native Hawaiian Caucus.

Daniel is a graduate of the Kapālama Campus of Kamehameha Schools and later furthered his education at the University of the Pacific where he earned a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration.

The Holt 'Ohana has been deeply rooted in the Kalihi-Palama community for three generations. His father is former Hawai'i State Legislator Milton Holt, who represented Kapālama, Kalihi, 'Alewa Heights, and Chinatown as both a Representative and Senator between 1978 to 1996. Representative Daniel Holt is a member of the Kalihi-Palama Hawaiian Civic Club and formerly served as the Chairman of the Kalihi - Palama Neighborhood Board.

After returning home from college, Daniel worked at Horizon Lines (now PASHA) for a couple of years before beginning his journey at the legislature. Representative Holt held many positions in the legislature including bills researcher for the Senate Ways and Means Committee, legislative aide to late Senator Gilbert Kahele, committee clerk the Senate Special Committee on Accountability, legislative director in the Senate President's office and in 2014, he was appointed by the Hawai'i State Senate to serve as the Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms. These prior experiences give Daniel a unique perspective on the legislative process which allows him to serve his constituents more effectively and efficiently.
