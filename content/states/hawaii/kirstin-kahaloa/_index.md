Representative Kirstin Kahaloa is a freshmen legislator for the Hawaiʻi House of Representatives, representing the district of Kona on Hawaiʻi Island. Representative Kahaloa is a Native Hawaiian legislator who serves as the Vice Chair of Agriculture and Food Systems and sits on the Finance Committee and Energy and Environmental Protection Committee.

Her passions center around strengthening Hawaii's local food system, education, and community well-being. She has previously worked for a nonprofit that focused on sustainability efforts, local food production, research and education. During the pandemic, she worked for a large land owner and educational institution where she focused on growing more food in Hawaiʻi to support farmers and food businesses to scale their operations. Rep Kahaloa previously served as an executive director of the Kona-Kohala Chamber of Commerce and was a previous founding board member and president of the Native Hawaiian Chamber of Commerce on Hawaiʻi Island. She also has a background in International Education, where she worked for over a decade at several institutions of higher education, aiding in recruitment and retention efforts of international students.

Representative Kahaloa is born and raised on Oʻahu and is a graduate of the Kamehameha Schools. She has strong ties to Hawaiʻi Island as both of her parents are from Hilo. Representative Kahaloa's daughter goes to a Hawaiian immersion public charter school, her partner works to manage Hawaiʻi's visit industry, and the ʻohana cares for Rep Kahaloa's father-in-law, who is a Vietnam veteran.
