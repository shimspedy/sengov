Representative Amy Perruso is a longtime resident of District 46's beautiful Launani Valley and Wahiawā communities. A teacher at heart, her endeavor to educate our children has taken her around the world, from California to Shanghai to Finland and, finally, to the Hawai'i Department of Education, where she taught social studies for almost 20 years.

Representative Perruso previously served as Secretary-Treasurer of the Hawai'i State Teachers Association. She was also a member of Gov. David Ige's Every Student Succeeds Act Team, which crafted a blueprint for the future of Hawai'i's public schools.

Representative Perruso has been a Fulbright Scholar and finalist for the Gilder-Lehrman National History Teacher of the Year Award. When she's not working for her community, Representative Perruso enjoys preserving our 'āina, surfing, and spending time with her family.
