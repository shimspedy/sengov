Representative Trish La Chica is a dedicated Filipino-American legislator and community leader representing the 37th district, which includes parts of Mililani Town, Mililani Mauka, Koa Ridge, and Waipi'o Gentry. Appointed by Governor Josh Green in 2023, she is committed to serving her constituents and improving her community.

Prior to joining the legislature, Representative La Chica spent over 15 years in leadership roles working for non-profit organizations, as well as state and county government in areas such as health, Medicaid, housing, and homelessness. Her passion for advocacy began as an investigative journalist in Manila, where she produced documentaries that shed light on the daily struggles of Filipino families and fought against corruption.

After moving to San Francisco to pursue a Masters in Public Administration and working for a national policy organization, Trish and her husband Cricket settled in Mililani, where they are raising their two children, Foggy and Ricki. In her free time, Representative La Chica enjoys spending time with her family and two dogs, going on hikes, visiting the beach, traveling, and experimenting with new recipes.

Representative La Chica remains steadfast in her commitment to her community and looks forward to leveraging her experience and leadership to create a brighter future for the people of Hawaii. She is dedicated to ensuring that everyone has access to the resources they need to succeed and will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal in the legislature.
