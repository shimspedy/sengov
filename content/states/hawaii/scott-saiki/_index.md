Representative Scott K. Saiki currently serves as the representative for House District 25, which includes the areas of Ala Moana and Kakaako.

Representative Saiki was born in Honolulu and grew up in Kailua, HI. Saiki earned his B.A. in Political Science from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and his J.D. from the University of Hawaii at Manoa's William S. Richardson School of Law. During his time at UH, Saiki won his first election to serve on the Campus Center Board for the University of Hawaii. In 1994, Saiki was first elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives.

Since the 2018 legislative session, Saiki has taken on the leadership role as Speaker of the House. Prior to being elected House Speaker by his peers, Representative Saiki served as the House Majority Leader from 2013-2017 where he passed legislation to legalize same-sex marriage in 2013, passed a first-in-nation law in 2015 that requires Hawaii’s utilities to generate 100% of their electric sales from renewable energy source by 2045, and introduced legislation in 2019 that created Hawaii’s statewide system of mail-in voting.

In August 2019, Representative Saiki was named President-Elect of the National Conference of State Legislatures; a bipartisan organization serving the nation's 7,383 state lawmakers and legislative staff.

In addition to serving as a State Representative, Saiki is a practicing attorney, specializing in disability law.
