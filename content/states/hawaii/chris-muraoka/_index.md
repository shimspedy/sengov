Chris Muraoka is a dedicated public servant and businessman who has been serving as a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives for the 45th district since November 5, 2024. Born and raised in Waianae, Hawaii, Muraoka has deep roots in his community. He graduated from Waianae High School in 1995 and later served in the U.S. Navy, which instilled in him a strong sense of duty and discipline.

Before entering politics, Muraoka founded SureCan LLC, a company that contracts workers for various jobs around Oahu. His business experience has given him a unique perspective on the challenges faced by small business owners and the importance of economic development in his district.

Muraoka's political career began with his involvement in the Waianae neighborhood board, where he worked to address local issues and improve the quality of life for his neighbors. In 2024, he announced his campaign for the open 45th district seat in the Hawaii House of Representatives. His campaign focused on key issues such as homelessness, violent crime, and education. Muraoka's dedication to these issues resonated with voters, and he successfully defeated his primary opponent, Tiana Wilbur, with 51.3% of the vote. He went on to win the general election against Democrat Desir√© DeSoto by a narrow margin of 209 votes, flipping the seat to the Republicans.

As a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives, Muraoka has continued to advocate for his constituents and work towards solutions for the pressing issues facing his district. His commitment to public service and his community has made him a respected and influential figure in Hawaii politics.
