Brenton Awa is a leader, blessed to have been given the opportunity to work for the people of District 23 in the State Senate (Kāne‘ohe, Kahalu‘u through Lā‘ie, Kahuku through Mokulē‘ia, Schofield Barracks, Kunia Camp).

Born in Ka‘a‘awa, raised in Kahalu‘u, and a graduate of Kahuku High School, Awa is committed to putting the needs of local people over politics, while representing them with the values embraced in the country.

Awa is currently the youngest elected State Senator at age 36. The Senator’s top priority is to make sure locals can afford to continue living in Hawaii, while also helping those who’ve been forced to leave, return.

Awa has deep roots in Ko‘olauloa and Ko‘olaupoko. The father of three currently lives in Kahalu‘u.

Prior to being elected in November of 2022, Awa had spent nearly a decade working as a TV News Anchor and Reporter for local ABC affiliate KITV4 Island News. Awa started his broadcast career in 2009 as the last intern for then KGMB9 News prior to being one of the first new hires at Hawaii News Now following the KGMB/KHNL/KFVE merger.

Awa also worked for the Department of Education as a substitute teacher within the Windward District and helped students at Kahuku High School create a weekly news broadcast, while also restoring the school’s agricultural farm. Awa, a former D1 collegiate wrestler, returned to Kahuku High School in 2008 and led the Junior Varsity Wrestling team to an undefeated season and an OIA title in his only stint as head coach.
