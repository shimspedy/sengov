Representative Mahina Poepoe serves District 13, which includes a portion of Kahului, Pāʻia, Haʻikū, Nāhiku, Hāna, Kīpahulu, Kaupō, Molokini, Kahoʻolawe, Lanaʻi, and Molokai. Born and raised on Molokai, she is a Native Hawaiian woman passionate about aloha ʻāina, and she seeks to bring this intention to our government. Representative Poepoe graduated from the University of Hawaii with a degree in Public Administration while also owning and operating a local surf shop on Molokai. However, she is most proud of her community advocacy background and the volunteer conservation work she has done throughout her district.

The Representative has worked with organizations such as ʻĀina Momona, the Molokai Maui Invasive Species Committee, Kiaʻi Kanaloa, and the Molokai Community Health Center. She co-founded Kūpeke Ahupuaʻa, and has led a successful effort to set a zero cap on short-term vacation rentals in Molokai. In her free time, Representative Poepoe enjoys engaging kilo ʻāina and mālama ʻāina work. It is the Representative’s hope that she can authentically maintain and advocate for the needs of rural communities while bringing greater awareness to aloha ʻāina during her time at the legislature.

Representative Poepoe is proud to serve as Vice Chair of the Water and Land Committee. She also sits on the Corrections, Military, and Veterans Committee and the Finance Committee.
