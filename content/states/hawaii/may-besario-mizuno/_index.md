Representative May Besario Mizuno is the representative of District 29, appointed by Governor Josh Green on January 16, 2024. May is a Filipino immigrant and has been a resident of Kalihi Valley for the past 21 years. Prior to her appointment as representative, she served as Chair of the Kalihi Valley Neighborhood Board for 6 years. During her free time, May loves to bond with her family and spend time with her fur babies Kobe and Minnie.

May Mizuno started her work at the House of Representatives in 2006 as a legislative aide to former Hawaii State Rep. Felipe Abinsay, and since then has accumulated 17 years of experience working as Chief of Staff Legislative Office Manager to former District 29 Representative John Mizuno. Her accomplishments include leading the Hawaii Outstanding Advocates for Children and Youth Day Month for 6 years, drafting H.B. 274 to establish Patriot Day in Hawaii, and organizing a statewide fundraising event to help the victims of Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, raising $100,000 to build two villages for the displaced families, among which were family of the Filipino communities. May Mizuno plans to focus on addressing crime and homelessness in the district and working to reduce the high cost of living in Hawaii through affordable housing, reducing taxes, and passing more policy on tax credits.
