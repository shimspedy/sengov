Rep. Scot Z. Matayoshi represents the 49th District, covering portions of Kāneʻohe and Kailua. He currently serves as Majority Whip and Chair of Labor & Government Operations. He also sits on the committees for Culture, Arts & International affairs, Education, and Higher Education & Technology.

As a former public school teacher, he knows the importance of a solid, well-rounded education. To that end he believes supporting and developing teachers in the classroom is one of the keys to education. He believes Hawaii needs a strong agricultural industry as part of the foundation of a stable economy. He is also committed to addressing the high cost of living in Hawaii, including housing.

Rep. Matayoshi graduated from Punahou School and interned with the late U.S. Sen. Daniel K. Akaka while attending Claremont McKenna College. He returned to Hawaii after graduation to become a public school science teacher at Nanakuli High and Intermediate School while earning a Master's Degree in Education from the University of Hawaii. He later received a law degree from the University of Hawaii.

Rep. Matayoshi serves on several community organizations, including as a board member of Malama Honua Public Charter School Foundation, a member of the Hawaii United Okinawa Association Legal Committee, and a member the Ko`olaupoko Hawaiian Civic Club.
