Representative Cedric Gates is now serving his 4th term representing District 45 which includes M훮kua, M훮kaha, and Wai'anae. He currently serves as the Chair of the House Committee on Agriculture and Food Systems. Additionally, he is a member of the House Committee on Consumer Protection & Commerce and the House Committee on Energy & Environmental Protection. A proud lifetime resident of Wai'anae and student attendee at Kamaile Elementary, Wai'anae High school, Youth Build Honolulu, and Leeward Community College. Representative Gates actively participates in community affairs, previously serving as the Chairman of the Wai'anae Coast Neighborhood Board #24 and a member of the Wai'anae Coast Comprehensive Health Center's Board of Directors. He also had the privilege of working for the United States Congress, the City Council, and at the Hawai'i State Capitol. In 2011, he co-founded the Active Hawai'i organization which is a 501(c) 3 non-profit that focuses on promoting community wellness and advocacy through an active lifestyle, and is now pursuing his bachelor's degree in Business Administration. Bringing both a love for the district and extensive experience in different sectors of the community, Representative Gates continues to find solutions for issues regarding affordable housing and homelessness, traffic, and preparing the next generation for their transition from academia to the workforce. Given the majority presence of Native Hawaiians in his district, he uses his capacity as Representative to support and preserve Native Hawaiian rights and culture, and more broadly inspire his community to become more engaged in the political process.
