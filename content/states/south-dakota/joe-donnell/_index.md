Joe Donnell, a native of Northeastern South Dakota, was born in 1979 to Mary and Vernal Donnell in Sisseton, SD. His mother, Mary, grew up on a farm on the state line of North and South Dakota and is a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. His father is a member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate from Veblen, SD.

Donnell's commitment to public service extends beyond politics. He is the founder and director of Warriors Circle, a Christian nonprofit organization that collaborates with Native Americans to develop leadership skills. His passion for community development and empowerment led him to run for office.

In June 2022, Donnell contested the Republican primary for the 1st District of the South Dakota Senate against incumbent Mike Rohl. Although he didn't secure the nomination, fate had other plans. Logan Manhart withdrew from the District 1 House race, and the South Dakota Republican Party selected Donnell as his replacement on the 2022 general election ballot for South Dakota House of Representatives District 1.

Donnell's victory in the general election marked a historic moment. Alongside Tamara St. John, he became one of two Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate tribal citizens serving in the 2023 legislature. At the swearing-in ceremony for Governor Kristi Noem's second term, Donnell introduced her.

Notably, Donnell gained attention when he shared his belief that there is a direct ley line connecting the Mount Rushmore National Memorial to Washington, DC. He suggested that demonic forces use the monument as a "freemason shrine" for practicing witchcraft and spreading communism. The Mount Rushmore National Memorial declined to comment on his claims.

Joe Donnell's journey from community leader to legislator reflects his dedication to making a positive impact on South Dakota and its people.
