Nicole Uhre-Balk is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the South Dakota House of Representatives for District 32. She assumed office on January 14, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 12, 2027.

Born and raised in Rapid City, South Dakota, Nicole Uhre-Balk grew up surrounded by the natural beauty of the Black Hills. Her early years were shaped by her family's ranching lifestyle, which instilled in her a deep appreciation for agriculture and small business operations. Her mother was actively involved in community organizations, and her aunt, Carole Hillard, served as the lieutenant governor of South Dakota from 1995 to 2003, inspiring Nicole's interest in public service.

Nicole attended Pinedale Elementary School and later worked at Black Hills Works during her high school years. She pursued higher education at Bethel University, earning a double major in biology and environmental studies. Her academic journey continued at Black Hills State University, where she obtained a Master’s degree in curriculum and instruction.

Before entering politics, Nicole dedicated over a decade to education, working as a high school and middle school biology and computer science teacher. Her career included roles at Muckleshoot Tribal Schools near Mount Rainier, Central High School, and a STEM lab in Boston, Massachusetts. As an education consultant at Compass, she provided professional development for teachers across South Dakota, focusing on curriculum mapping, computational thinking, and integrating artificial intelligence into educational programs.

Nicole's political career began with her candidacy for the South Dakota House of Representatives in 2024. Representing District 32, which includes parts of downtown Rapid City and surrounding areas, she campaigned on a platform emphasizing education reform, including revising the state’s school funding formula, increasing teacher salaries, and supporting career-ready skills programs for students. Her victory in the 2024 election marked a historic moment, as she became the first Democrat to represent her district in 18 years.

In her role as a legislator, Nicole Uhre-Balk continues to advocate for her community, addressing issues such as sustainability, public education, and social justice. She is actively involved in local organizations, including the Rapid City Sustainability Committee and Friends of Rapid City Parks. Nicole resides in Rapid City with her spouse, Forest Balk, and remains committed to making a positive impact in her district and beyond.
