Tim Reed is a distinguished member of the South Dakota State Senate, representing District 7. He is a member of the Republican Party. His tenure began in 2023 and his current term is set to end on January 14, 2025. 

Before his time in the State Senate, Reed served District 7 for six legislative sessions. His political career also includes a significant tenure in Brookings city government, where he served for 13 years, including three terms as mayor.

Reed's educational background includes a B.S. in economics and computer science, which he earned from South Dakota State University in 1988. This strong foundation in economics and computer science has undoubtedly influenced his political career and decision-making process.

In addition to his political roles, Reed has also held several important positions in the field of economic development. He has worked as the CEO and chief economic development officer of the Brookings Economic Development Corporation. He also served as the development director of the South Dakota State University Foundation. These roles have given him a deep understanding of the economic landscape of South Dakota and have equipped him with the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions that benefit his constituents and the state as a whole.

Reed's commitment to service extends beyond his professional roles. He has served as the advisory board chairman of the Center for the Prevention of Child Maltreatment and the president of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board. 

In the State Senate, Reed has been assigned to several committees. During the 2023-2024 legislative session, he served on the Senate Education Committee, Senate Government Operations and Audit Committee, Senate Health and Human Services Committee, and was the Chair of the Senate Local Government Committee. His committee assignments reflect his diverse interests and areas of expertise.

Reed is currently running for re-election to the South Dakota State Senate to represent District 7. The Republican primary for this office on June 4, 2024, was canceled. The general election for South Dakota State Senate District 7 will be held on November 5, 2024, where Reed will be running against Patty Bacon.
