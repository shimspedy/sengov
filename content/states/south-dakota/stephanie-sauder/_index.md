Stephanie Sauder is a fourth-generation South Dakotan and lifelong Hamlin County resident. After serving District 4 in the House of Representatives and serving as Mayor of Bryant, Steph is now running to serve in the State Senate.

## Focused on Family

Steph has deep roots in South Dakota. She grew up farming with her family, the Laknesses, in Hamlin County. Today, the fifth generation of the Lakness Family Farm operation continues to farm, as do Steph and her husband, Jerry. Their combined operations cover Hamlin, Codington, Clark, and Kingsbury counties.

Steph and Jerry are the proud parents of Levi and Isaac. Both sons followed the call for public service as law enforcement officers in South Dakota, protecting their communities. Grandson George keeps the Sauder family on their toes.

As a retired elementary school teacher, Steph is passionate about ensuring that South Dakota schools are the best they can be, so students have bright futures. She has also owned and managed a local newspaper, believing in reaching out to the public with information and transparency.

## Focused on Community

Steph learned the values of faith, family, freedom, and farming from her parents, Milt and Benita Lakness. Her parents emphasized public service and giving back to the community. Milt served as a State House Representative, and Benita served as a Hamlin County Commissioner. For eight years, Steph served as mayor in Bryant, where she led with common sense, conservative values, and always did what was best for her neighbors and the community.

As a legislator, Steph continues to collaborate with citizens throughout the district on all issues. Her focus, discipline, and principles have resulted in legislative wins for the region—a trend that will continue when she moves to the State Senate.

## Focused on South Dakota

Steph’s approach to serving in the Legislature is simple: listen to the citizens and do good things for South Dakota. As a mother, grandmother, farmer, retired teacher, former small business owner, community volunteer, and woman of faith, Steph knows the issues important to South Dakota. She is committed to working toward positive policy initiatives that will help move the state forward while preserving our rural values.
