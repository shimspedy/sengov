Erik Muckey is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the South Dakota House of Representatives. He represents District 15 and assumed office on January 14, 2025. His current term is set to conclude on January 12, 2027.

Born in Platte, South Dakota, Erik Muckey grew up in a family deeply rooted in rural education and community values. He is the sixth generation of Dutch immigrants to settle in Douglas County, South Dakota. Muckey graduated from Corsica High School and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of South Dakota in 2014. His passion for public service was ignited during his time at USD, where he served as the Student Government Association President and interned for the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.

Muckey furthered his education by obtaining a graduate certificate in nonprofit management from the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs in 2020. His professional journey includes roles in government and financial services, where he gained experience in financial analysis, consulting, project management, and strategy. These roles prepared him for his current work as the CEO of Lost&Found, a nonprofit organization dedicated to comprehensive suicide prevention and support for youth and young adults.

In addition to his work with Lost&Found, Muckey has been an advocate for mental health initiatives, successfully leading efforts to secure bipartisan legislation that allocated $2 million for youth suicide prevention in South Dakota. He also founded PASQ, a consulting firm focused on rural economic development and nonprofit management, and has served as an adjunct instructor of economics at the University of South Dakota.

Muckey resides in downtown Sioux Falls with his wife, Sadie, who is also a nonprofit leader. Together, they are committed to making economic opportunities and healthcare more accessible to their community. Through his diverse experiences and dedication to public service, Erik Muckey continues to work toward creating a better future for the residents of District 15 and beyond.
