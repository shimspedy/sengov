Lynn Schneider, a Republican, has been a dedicated public servant in South Dakota. Born and raised on a farm in rural Beadle County, he developed a strong work ethic and a commitment to community.

After graduating from Huron High School, Schneider pursued higher education at Huron University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and business. His academic background laid the foundation for his future endeavors.

Schneider's service extends beyond the classroom. He served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating courage and patriotism. Following his military service, he embarked on a successful career in the banking industry, accumulating 41 years of experience. Notably, he held leadership positions as the CEO of F&M Marquette Bank and American Bank & Trust.

In 2020, Governor Kristi Noem appointed Schneider to the South Dakota House of Representatives, succeeding Bob Glanzer. Since then, he has actively contributed to legislative discussions, advocating for policies that benefit his constituents. His commitment to public service and community well-being remains unwavering.

Schneider's dedication to South Dakota, combined with his diverse background, makes him a valuable asset in the state legislature. As an incumbent representing District 22, he continues to work tirelessly for the betterment of his community.
