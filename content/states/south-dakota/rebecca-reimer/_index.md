Rebecca Reimer has served District 26B since being first elected in 2018. In 2020, Reimer received 70% of the vote in her bid for a second term. During the 2021-2022 legislative session, Reimer was elected by her colleagues to serve as a member of the House leadership in the position of Majority Whip. Additionally, she will serve on the State Affairs and Judiciary Committees.  During her first term, Reimer was selected to serve on three committees: Judiciary, Education and Local Government. She also served as Vice-Chair of the summer study on Redefining Nursing Home Criteria.

During her Freshman term, Reimer was able to successfully introduce and shepherd to passage a law that extended the effective date for South Dakota marriage license applications providing greater flexibility for engaged couples. Reimer also worked alongside fellow legislators to amend the Habitat Stamp bill to protect businesses in District 26B. In addition, Reimer introduced legislation commemorating the heroic response and life-saving actions by Police Officers Teil Glaus and Garrett Harmon, Highway Patrol Trooper Josh De Wild and Chief Deputy Sheriff Tory Engel at the scene of an airplane crash in Chamberlain.

Reimer was selected to attend Bowhay Institute for Legislative Leadership Development (BILLD), a leadership training programs designed for Midwestern legislators. In addition to its focus on leadership training, such as conflict resolution and negotiation, BILLD includes policy sessions on issues such as education, corrections, health care and economic development, as well as seminars on media relations, priority management and consensus building.
