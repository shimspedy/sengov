Liz Larson grew up in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. She is a working mom with a passion for community empowerment. Liz believes in making the world a better place, starting right here in our own backyard.

With over 20 years of experience in project management and policy advising, Liz knows how to set goals, build coalitions, and get things done. Her values are rooted in integrity, compassion, and hard workâ€”qualities she learned from her upbringing.

Liz is the daughter of a Vietnam Veteran and the wife of a law enforcement officer. As a mom to two wonderful children, she understands the importance of advocating for the next generation.

Her love for South Dakota's natural beauty runs deep. Liz caught her first walleye in Big Stone Lake in the 1980s and has been reeling in fish, hunting, and hiking ever since.

Liz's career took her to international work, where she made a difference in various countries. She worked on post-tsunami economic recovery in Indonesia, agricultural extension and community finance in Cambodia, microfinance in India and Nepal, and inclusive financial services in the Pacific Islands.

Now, as a State Senator, Liz is committed to fighting for issues that matter to South Dakotans. She advocates for affordable healthcare, quality education, and an economy that works for everyone.

Contact Liz to share the issues you're passionate about. She's dedicated to faithfully representing the best interests of the people in District 10.
