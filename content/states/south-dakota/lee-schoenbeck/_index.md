Schoenbeck's early life was spent in Webster, South Dakota. He pursued his higher education at Augustana University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. He furthered his education at the University of South Dakota School of Law, earning a Juris Doctor degree.

In addition to his political career, Schoenbeck is the owner of Schoenbeck Law, P.C., where he specializes in civil litigation. His legal career has been marked by his expertise in this field.

Schoenbeck's political career has been extensive and varied. He served as a member of the Senate from 1995 to 1997 and again from 2003 to 2007. From 2015 to 2017, he represented the 5th district in the South Dakota House of Representatives. In 2021, Schoenbeck opposed a proposal to limit the activities of South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks conservation officers.

In 2021, Schoenbeck proposed an amendment to the South Dakota Constitution which would increase the threshold required to pass voter referendums from a majority to 60%.
