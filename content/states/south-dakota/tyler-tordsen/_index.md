Tyler Tordsen, a Republican, was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of South Dakota in 2015. Tordsen's career experience includes serving as the southeast regional director and state director of tribal affairs for US Senator Mike Rounds. 

In addition to his political work, Tordsen has been an active member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Sioux Tribe. His commitment to public service led him to run for the South Dakota House of Representatives, where he has represented District 14 since 2023. Alongside Taylor Rehfeldt, he has worked diligently to serve his constituents and contribute to legislative decisions.

Tordsen's educational journey began at the University of South Dakota, where he initially pursued medical biology and political science. However, influential internships and involvement in student organizations, such as the Student Government Association, led him to switch his majors to economics and political science.

As a legislator, Tordsen has sponsored bills and actively participated in committee assignments. Notably, he has served on the House Education Committee and the House Judiciary Committee during the 2023-2024 term.

Looking ahead, Tordsen is running for re-election in the Republican primary on June 4, 2024. His dedication to public service continues to shape South Dakota's legislative landscape, and voters will have the opportunity to decide his fate in the upcoming general election.
