Travis Ismay is a member of the Republican Party serving in the South Dakota House of Representatives. He represents District 28B and assumed office on January 14, 2025. His current term is set to end on January 12, 2027.

Born and raised near Vale, South Dakota, Travis Ismay grew up on his family’s farm and ranch operation. His father, a veterinarian, practiced in Sturgis for over five decades, while his mother, a microbiologist, worked alongside him. Ismay pursued higher education at Western Dakota Technical Institute, earning an associate degree in diesel mechanics. After working in the diesel industry for several years, he returned to his roots to manage the family ranch.

In 1998, Ismay married his wife, Dusta, and together they have raised six children while continuing to work on the ranch. In 2008, they expanded their endeavors by starting a welding business, which has earned a reputation for quality and fairness within their community. Ismay’s commitment to his community and his values led him to explore local and state government, where he was struck by the dysfunction he observed. This motivated him to run for office, not as a politician but as a statesman dedicated to upholding constitutional principles and moral integrity.

As a legislator, Ismay emphasizes reducing government bureaucracy and overreach, advocating for lower taxes and the enforcement of existing laws rather than creating new ones. He is a strict constitutionalist, believing that laws contrary to the Constitution, whether federal or state, are null and void. Ismay approaches his legislative duties with a commitment to thorough research and a moral compass guided by his faith. His goal is to serve his constituents with honesty and dedication, ensuring that every decision he makes aligns with the values he holds dear.
