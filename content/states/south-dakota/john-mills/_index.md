John H. Mills, a Republican, was born in South Dakota. His career experience spans various fields, including construction, real estate development, and property management. Mills has been an active member of the South Dakota House of Representatives, representing District 8 since January 10, 2023. His current term is set to end on January 14, 2025.

Throughout his legislative career, Mills has been involved in several committees. In the 2023-2024 session, he was assigned to the House Appropriations Committee. In previous sessions, he also served on the Appropriations Committee and held the position of Chair in the House Transportation Committee during the 2019-2020 session.

Mills has been a dedicated public servant, contributing to the legislative process and advocating for the interests of his constituents. His commitment to South Dakota and its residents continues to shape his work in the state legislature.

In the 2022 general election, Mills secured re-election to the South Dakota House of Representatives District 8 alongside Tim Reisch. The Republican primary victory earlier that year demonstrated his strong support within the party.

Despite term limits preventing him from filing for re-election in 2024, Mills leaves a lasting impact on South Dakota politics. His dedication to public service and his contributions to the legislative process remain commendable.
