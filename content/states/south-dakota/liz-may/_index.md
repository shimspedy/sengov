Elizabeth Marty May (born January 1, 1961) is an American politician and a Republican member of the South Dakota House of Representatives. She has been representing District 27 since January 12, 2021. Prior to her current term, she served from January 11, 2013, to 2019, alongside Kevin Killer (2013-2017) and Steve Livermont (2017-2019).

Liz May's political journey has been marked by both victories and challenges. In 2018, she faced defeat at the hands of Democrat Peri Pourier. Undeterred, she later ran for another seat and succeeded Oglala Republican Steve Livermont.

Beyond her legislative role, Liz May chairs the conservative principles PAC in South Dakota. However, it's worth noting that this PAC has been criticized for disseminating mailers with misinformation.

May's educational background includes graduating from Spearfish High School. Her commitment to public service led her to run for office in 2006 and 2012.

In the 2006 election, when District 27 incumbent Democratic Representative Paul Valandra vacated his seat, May ran as an Independent. Unfortunately, she lost to incumbent Democratic Representative Jim Bradford and Republican nominee Mark DeVries.

In 2012, when District 27 incumbent Democratic Representative Edward Iron Cloud left the Legislature, May secured the Republican nomination. In the subsequent three-way November 2012 General election, she took the second seat with 2,982 votes (36.29%), ahead of Independent candidate Kathleen Ann.

Liz May's contributions extend beyond politics. She hails from Belle Fourche, South Dakota, and has connections to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Additionally, she is a rancher and an advocate for conservative principles.

Overall, Liz Marty May's journey reflects resilience, determination, and a commitment to serving her constituents in South Dakota.
