Scott Odenbach was elected to the South Dakota House of Representatives in 2020, representing District 31, which comprises all of Lawrence County, South Dakota. He actively serves on the Education and Judiciary Committees, contributing to important legislative decisions.

A fifth-generation South Dakotan, Scott grew up in Eureka, South Dakota. He and his wife, Laura, have been married since 1995 and are proud parents of three children. Scott earned a Bachelor of Science degree from South Dakota State University in 1995 and later obtained a Juris Doctor from the University of South Dakota School of Law in 2001.

Scott's professional journey has been diverse. From 2003 to 2006, he served as Assistant General Counsel for the Florida Department of Education. Since 2006, Scott has practiced law in Spearfish, South Dakota, specializing in business, estate, and real property law. He started with Seward and Odenbach, P.C., and has been the sole owner of the Odenbach Law Office since 2011.

Beyond his legal practice, Scott wears multiple hats. He manages Liberty Tree Properties, a real estate firm in Spearfish, and serves as the managing broker. Scott's commitment to education extends beyond legislation; he previously served on the Spearfish School Board from 2017 to 2020. Additionally, he contributes to the community by being on the board of directors for the Spearfish Community Foundation and a member of the Black Hills State University President’s Advisory Council.

Scott and his family are active members of St. Joseph’s Catholic Church in Spearfish. When he's not immersed in law or politics, Scott enjoys skiing at Terry Peak during winter, pheasant hunting in the fall, spending quality time with family and friends, and exploring the beautiful Black Hills whenever possible.

Interestingly, Scott's grandfather used to own and operate an elevator in Greenway, South Dakota. The elevator served as a hub for local farmers, where they would sell grain, buy coal, get haircuts, and catch up with old friends over a bottle of Coca-Cola.

Scott Odenbach's dedication to public service, legal expertise, and community involvement make him a valuable representative for South Dakota's District 31.
