Will D. Mortenson, born in Pierre, South Dakota, is an American attorney and a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. He graduated from T. F. Riggs High School and attended the University of South Dakota (USD), where he received his B.A. Mortenson played a key role in the 2010 reelection campaign of Public Utilities Commissioner Dusty Johnson. Later, he worked in the Office of Governor Dennis Daugaard as a policy analyst.

In 2016, Mortenson graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law with his J.D. He then embarked on a legal career in Fort Pierre, focusing on representing agricultural producers and business owners in District 24.

Notably, he filed articles of impeachment against Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg in 2021 and again in 2022, leading to Ravnsborg's removal from office. In 2022, Mortenson made history by becoming the youngest Republican to serve as House Majority Leader in the state, as well as the first tribal member to lead a majority caucus.
