Dean Albert Wink (born September 25, 1944) is an American politician and former football player. He played parts of three seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1966 to 1968. A Republican, Wink has had a distinguished career in both sports and public service.

Career Highlights:

He started his only game the following year. In the offseason, Wink received his master's degree in education. He was waived on July 15, 1969.

- Rancher and Educator: After retiring from football, Wink returned to Yankton College and later moved to Arizona, where he became a rancher. He also worked for a Texas cattle company. In 1988, he and his wife Joan returned to South Dakota, where they bought a ranch in Meade County. Joan retired from the faculty of California State University ten years later.

Elections:
- In 2008, Wink ran for the South Dakota House of Representatives in District 29. He won the three-way Republican primary and secured the second seat in the general election.
