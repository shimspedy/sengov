Mary Fitzgerald, an American politician and accountant, was born in Vermillion, South Dakota. She attended the University of South Dakota and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting and business administration from Black Hills State University.

In November 2020, Fitzgerald was elected to the South Dakota House of Representatives, assuming office on January 12, 2021. Her commitment to public safety led her to draft and pass House Bill 1061 (Codified Law ยง 22-42-24), which prohibits smoking and consuming marijuana and its derivatives in a motor vehicle. Notably, she is the only state legislator in South Dakota to successfully pass such a public safety bill related to marijuana use.

Fitzgerald's dedication extends beyond legislation. She was selected to serve on the Criminal Justice & Public Safety Committee of the Midwestern Legislative Conference. Additionally, on January 14, 2023, she was elected Vice-Chair of the South Dakota State Republican Party, working alongside State Chair Senator John Wiik.

Throughout her career, Fitzgerald has been an active member of the Republican Party, serving as chair of the Lawrence County Republican Party. Her commitment to fiscal responsibility and public safety continues to shape her legislative work.
