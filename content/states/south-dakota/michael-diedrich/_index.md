Michael Diedrich is an American politician and attorney. Born in Rapid City, South Dakota, he attended Rapid City Central High School. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of South Dakota, a Juris Doctor from the University of South Dakota School of Law, a Master of Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and a Master of Laws in healthcare law from the Loyola University Chicago School of Law.

Diedrich has had a distinguished career in public service. He served as a member of the South Dakota Senate from 1987 to 1991 and again from 1993 to 1995. In addition to his legislative work, Diedrich worked in the Rapid City attorney's office and served as the vice president of government relations for Regional Health (now Monument Health).

In 2017, Governor Dennis Daugaard appointed Diedrich to the South Dakota House of Representatives, succeeding Craig Tieszen, who tragically passed away in a boating accident on November 23, 2017. Diedrich assumed office on December 29, 2017, and has continued to serve the people of South Dakota.

His commitment to public service, legal expertise, and dedication to healthcare issues make him a valuable asset to the state. As a Republican representative, Diedrich continues to advocate for the well-being of his constituents.
