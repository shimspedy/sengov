Amber Hulse, a member of the Republican Party, serves in the South Dakota State Senate representing District 30. She assumed office on January 14, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 12, 2027. 

Born in Spearfish, South Dakota, Amber Hulse has always been deeply connected to her roots. Her upbringing on a hunting ranch instilled in her a strong sense of service and patriotism, values further reinforced by her Vietnam veteran father. Amber's academic journey is marked by excellence; she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of South Dakota in 2021 and later earned her law degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 2024. During her time at Georgetown, she demonstrated leadership as President of the Federalist Society and gained invaluable experience working in the first Trump White House.

Amber's career trajectory is as impressive as her academic achievements. Before entering the South Dakota State Senate, she clerked for Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, Senator Josh Hawley, and Governor Kristi Noem. Her legal expertise was honed through roles such as a Summer Associate at Gunderson, Palmer, Nelson, & Ashmore, LLP in Rapid City, South Dakota, and as a Law Clerk at Dhillon Law Group.

Amber's commitment to her state extends beyond politics. She is one of only four women to have earned both the titles of Miss South Dakota (2019) and Miss South Dakota USA (2023). These accomplishments reflect her dedication to empowering women in leadership and championing conservative values. As one of the youngest State Senators in South Dakotaâ€™s history, Amber Hulse continues to advocate for the next generation of conservative leaders while serving her constituents with passion and integrity.
