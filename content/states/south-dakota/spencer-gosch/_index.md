Spencer Gosch, a member of the Republican Party, serves in the South Dakota House of Representatives, representing District 23. He assumed office on January 14, 2025, and his current term is set to end on January 12, 2027.

Born on January 22, 1984, in Mobridge, South Dakota, Spencer Gosch has spent most of his life in rural Walworth County. He graduated from Selby High School and pursued higher education at the University of South Dakota, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Marketing and a Bachelor of Science in Media and Journalism. His professional background includes working as a small business owner and contributing to his family farm, showcasing his deep connection to his community and its values.

Gosch's political career began in 2017 when he was elected to the South Dakota House of Representatives. During his tenure, he held significant leadership roles, including serving as Speaker Pro Tempore from 2019 to 2020 and as Speaker of the House from 2021 to 2022. His leadership was marked by his commitment to conservative principles, earning him recognition and high ratings from organizations such as the National Rifle Association and South Dakota Right to Life.

In 2022, Gosch decided to run for a seat in the South Dakota Senate but was defeated in the Republican primary by incumbent Bryan Breitling. However, he made a political comeback in 2024, reclaiming his former House seat after defeating incumbent James D. Wangness. His dedication to public service and his ability to connect with voters have solidified his position as a respected figure in South Dakota politics.

Outside of his political career, Spencer Gosch is a devoted family man. He met his wife, Ashley, during their college years, and they have been married for over 15 years. Together, they have three children—Teagan, Brody, and Remmy—who are a source of pride and joy for the Gosch family. His personal and professional life reflects his commitment to his community, his family, and the values he holds dear.
