Sen. Cody Rogers was first elected to the state Senate in 2020 to represent Senate District 37, which includes parts of Tulsa County.

The Tulsa Republican graduated from Catoosa High School. Prior to serving in the Senate, he began a paving construction company in 2015 with a hard hat and a $5,000 loan. Since then, he’s built it into a successful enterprise that employs dozens of Oklahomans and works on multi-million-dollar projects. He’s also worked in the oil and gas industry.

Rogers and his wife, Danielle, have five children.
