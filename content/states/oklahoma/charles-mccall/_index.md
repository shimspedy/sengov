Charles McCall is Oklahoma’s longest-serving Speaker of the House of Representatives. Elected to represent House District 22 in 2012 and elected Speaker in 2016, the fifth-generation Atoka native’s steady leadership has steered state government from trying times into prosperity.

A community banker by profession, McCall’s focus on getting the state’s fiscal house in order has brought the state budget out of shortfalls and into solvency. During his tenure as Speaker, personal and corporate income taxes have decreased while public common education funding has increased by 35% and state reserves have been built up to record levels. These fiscal and education achievements, plus McCall’s sustained commitment to transportation and broadband infrastructure statewide, are helping grow Oklahoma’s economy. McCall has also stood strong for Oklahoma’s rights as a state, authoring legislation to fight back against federal overreach into state sovereignty.

The first Republican Speaker from southeastern Oklahoma, McCall’s prioritization of public policies that work in all parts of Oklahoma and emphasis on functionality, civility and respect in government has helped grow the House Republican Caucus from 72 members in his first term as Speaker to 81 members today, reflecting increased public support for Republican governance in Oklahoma.

McCall has always balanced public service with his private sector role as CEO and Board Chairman of AmeriState Bank in Atoka, a fourth-generation family bank. Prior to his election to the House of Representatives, McCall served as Mayor of Atoka from 2005 to 2012 after previous tenures as Chairman of the Atoka City Industrial Development Authority, Chairman of the Lake Atoka Reservation Association and Vice Chairman of the McGee Creek Authority – all positions he held while maintaining his duties at the bank. McCall holds a bachelor’s degree in finance from the University of Oklahoma and completed the Graduate School of Banking at the University of Colorado in Boulder.

McCall and his wife, Stephanie Ann (Hays) McCall, have been married for 29 years and met on a blind date at the University of Oklahoma. Stephanie is a former elementary teacher in the Atoka Public School System. The McCalls have two sons, Chase and Carson, both students at the University of Oklahoma. The McCalls attend Cornerstone Church.
