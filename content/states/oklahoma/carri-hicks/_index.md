Senator Carri Hicks is a mother, an educator, and a lifelong Oklahoman. The daughter of a public school teacher, Hicks graduated from Oklahoma City University. She earned her bachelor's degree in mass communications and political science. Hicks furthered her education at OCU by earning a master's degree with a focus on leadership management. She went on to work for United Way of Central Oklahoma and Saint Luke's United Methodist Church. Hicks developed skills in fundraising, advertising, and publishing throughout her career in the nonprofit sector.

A life-long learner with a passion for education, Hicks decided to seek a career change. She earned her masters in early childhood education and applied for a teaching certificate. Hicks began working as a public school teacher in the Putnam City School District in 2011. After three years teaching Kindergarten at Tulakes Elementary, Hicks moved to the Deer Creek School District, where she taught First Grade for two years and Fourth Grade Math and Science for two years at Grove Valley Elementary.

Hicks has served as an adjunct professor at OCU teaching in the College of Education. In the summer of 2019, she was named a Gaylord-McCasland Education Fellow by the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, and worked to reshape the museum experience for young learners.

Today, Hicks lives in Northwest Oklahoma City with her husband Spencer. Married in 2011, they are the proud parents of three children: Camilla, Holli, and Sawyer.
