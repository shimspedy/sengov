Rep. Jacob Rosecrants was elected out of his classroom to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 2017. Before that, he taught social studies at the middle and high school level in inner city schools. This experience gave Jacob a unique perspective into many of the issues and trauma facing children today and drove him to take action. It is his passion to do all he can to help children through positive advocacy and common sense bipartisan legislation.

Rep. Rosecrants's passion for public education has turned into bipartisan action. He recently authored and passed the Oklahoma Play to Learn Act (HB 1569), which empowers early childhood educators to teach with play in their classrooms. To help students achieve better academic, mental health, and physical health outcomes, Jacob is currently working on a bill to require at least 40 minutes of recess for pre-K through 8th grade students in public schools.

Jacob has resided in Norman over 30 years and is a proud product of Norman Public Schools and the University of Oklahoma. He is the father of two children, Spencer and Jonah, and four dogs, all of whom he raises alongside his long-time partner, Robin.

Jacob's numerous accolades include:

• Member of the bipartisan and bicameral Early Childhood Legislative Caucus

• 2021 Oklahoma Education Association Outstanding Legislator

• 2021 Oklahoma Institute for Child Advocacy Lawmaker of the Year

• 2021 Oklahoma School Psychological Association Legislator of the Year

• 2021 Oklahoma Association of Young Children "Friend of Young Children Award"
