Sen. Grant Green was elected to the Oklahoma State Senate in Nov. 2022. He proudly represents the citizens of Senate District 28, serving all of Seminole and Lincoln Counties, along with portions of Oklahoma, Pottawatomie, and Logan Counties.

A native Oklahoman, Green grew up in Wellston, where he graduated high school. He is a rancher, farmer, and hunter who loves the land. His family roots in the district are deep and go back at least six generations.

Overall, he will fight for small businesses and against government mandates, protect rural Oklahoma, defend Oklahomansâ€™ God-given rights and the Second Amendment, as well as fight for the unborn and those without a voice.

Green and his wife of 24 years, Dana, share five children and two grandchildren. The couple attends Saint Paul Lutheran Church, where Grant was baptized.

Senator Green is the former owner of Green's Propane, a family business started by his father. Green and his brother bought the company in 2004. In 2016, Grant became the sole owner before selling the business in 2020.
