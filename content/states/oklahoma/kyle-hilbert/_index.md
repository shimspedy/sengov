Kyle Hilbert is the State Representative for Oklahoma House District 29, which contains parts of Creek & Tulsa counties. Kyle, his wife Alexis, and two daughters live in Bristow, OK.

He attended Oklahoma State University where he earned a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Agribusiness. While at OSU, Kyle served as Student Government Association President. Hilbert has championed several major pieces of legislation in his seven years in the legislature such as SB609 which overhauled our state's ad valorem reimbursement system and The DRIVE Act which established an equitable tax structure for electric vehicles in the state of Oklahoma.

In the 2022 session Hilbert was elected by his colleagues to the position of Speaker Pro Tempore of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. He was re-elected to a full term in 2023. Prior to this role, Hilbert spent three years as Vice Chair of the Appropriations and Budget Committee. Hilbert's primary policy focus since joining the legislature has been on the state budget & workforce development.
