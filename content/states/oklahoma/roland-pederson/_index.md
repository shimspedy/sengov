As a second-generation farmer and educator, Roland Pederson is a man of faith, integrity, and family—values he lives out in his daily life. He has spent the majority of his professional life, together with his wife Terry, building a family farm business that his Danish immigrant father began near Burlington. For the past 40 years, they have primarily produced cattle, wheat, and alfalfa.

With a mother who became a schoolteacher at a time when few women pursued higher education, the importance of education has always been emphasized in the Pederson family. Roland earned Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from Northwestern Oklahoma State University in Alva. Prior to pursuing production agriculture full-time, Roland served as a Chisholm High School science teacher and as Kremlin-Hillsdale Middle School’s principal.

As a lifelong resident of Senate District 19, Roland is dedicated to serving the interests and protecting the freedoms of Oklahoma families. Pro-life and pro-second amendment, Roland knows District 19 is home to some great Oklahomans. While in the Senate, Roland will focus on four key areas: education, small business, agriculture and infrastructure.

Roland’s long history of community service includes 20 years on the Burlington Cooperative Association board of directors, 30 years on the Alfalfa County Farm Bureau board of directors, past president of the Burlington Lions Club, and service on the Alfalfa Electric Cooperative Round-Up board of directors. He was also appointed to serve on the Agriculture Diversification and Enhancement Board and was a member of the Class III Oklahoma Agriculture Leadership Program.

Roland’s service in the Air Force Reserves gives him the background to understand issues important to Vance Air Force Base. The Burlington businessman is also well known for his volunteer leadership on the Oklahoma Farm Bureau board of directors. Statewide awards include Oklahoma Farm Bureau Farm Family of the Year and Oklahoma Farm Bureau Distinguished Service Award.

A social and fiscal conservative, Roland believes the Bible is the Truth and it is the direction for his life. He believes it was the foundation on which this country was built and is the underlying guideline in forming our constitution and building family values. He has more than 50 years of service to the Driftwood Christian Church, investing time as board chairman, elder and Sunday school teacher.

Family is important to Roland and he believes the future of Oklahoma families should be front and center. He and Terry, a middle school teacher, have two daughters, Kristy and Toni, who share in their parents’ passion for agriculture and education and are engaged in the family farm business. Toni works in rural and agriculture lending at a regional bank, and Kristy is a professor at Kansas State University. Kristy and her husband, Cory, have three children, Kyden, Nekoline, and Abilyn.

Our Faith. Our Freedom. The Future For Our Families.
