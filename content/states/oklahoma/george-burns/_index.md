Senator George Burns grew up in the beautiful southeast corner of Oklahoma in the Pollard community, near Haworth, where he and his wife, Patty, have also lived and raised their family. Burns was honored to be elected to the state Senate in 2020 to represent District 5, encompassing communities in LeFlore, McCurtain, and Pushmataha Counties.

The McCurtain county Republican is a graduate of Haworth High School and the Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology. He began his career as a journeyman electrician, rising up through the ranks to senior electrical engineering and construction project manager and account manager, continuing on his productive path to partner and part owner of a leading electrical engineering and construction firm. Over the years, Burns successfully worked with many different clients in a wide variety of industrial energy sectors throughout the United States overseeing all phases of multi-million-dollar electrical and mechanical construction projects. Burns is a licensed Master Electrician and holds an Oklahoma Electrical Contractor's license as well.

After retiring as part owner and manager, Burns served in several leadership roles within the electrical industry, including president of the Choctaw Electric Cooperative board and board member for the Western Farmers Electric Cooperative, relinquishing these positions to run for state senate. Burns is a council member for business and engineering career development at the Idabel Kiamichi Technology Center.

As a longtime member of Lukfata Baptist Church, proud father of four children and eight grandchildren, rural community born and raised, and the dedicated husband of a career educator and reading specialist, Burns values some of the most important elements of our Oklahoma way of life - faith, family, freedom, and education. His heartfelt desire is to represent District 5 with the same regard for high standards, achievement, and accountability that he approaches his vocation and life.
