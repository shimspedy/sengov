Senator Mary B. Boren was first elected to the Oklahoma State Senate in November 2018 and reelected in 2022. She represents the people living in District 16 which covers The University of Oklahoma and Norman in Cleveland County.

After graduating with distinction from the University of Oklahoma, College of Law in 1992, Senator Boren began her education policy career as a Carl Albert Executive Fellow for the State Regents of Higher Education and State Textbook Committee, where she served all of Oklahoma’s universities and public schools.

She was enlisted by Governors Walters and Henry to serve as an interim legal analyst during the last weeks of the legislative sessions in 1993, 1994, and 2003, where she reviewed and briefed legislation for the Governors’ approval.

Senator Boren was an active member of the Young Democrats during her college years, which lead to coordinating statewide volunteers for State Superintendent Sandy Garrett. In 2008, she was trained as a voter protection attorney during the March 2008 primary election in Texas.

Senator Boren credits her participation in the Institute for Child Advocacy’s Kids Count Leaders training and the American Bar Association’s Children and Law Committee, as motivation to become a Child Advocacy Attorney and provide affordable legal representation for foster parents, grandparents, and parents undergoing family crisis from 2003-2009. In 2009, she became a certified school counselor and worked for Little Axe High School and Adams Elementary School in Norman until 2015. Senator Boren was elected by her peers to serve on the Professional Educators of Norman bargaining team.

She is currently a member of Latina’s Women in Norman to support the Mosiacos After-school Program for English language learners at Truman Elementary and is a member of PTA for Adams Elementary and for Norman High School. After the 2013 storms, Senator Boren worked for the Center for Children and Families to connect storm survivors with mental health resources. She recently served as the Estate and Legacy Attorney for The Salvation Army and now practices probate and estate law in a firm in Edmond, Oklahoma.

Senator Boren has been married to Dr. Nathan Boren who board certified Family Physician since 1992. Together they have three children (Altus, Harrison, and Macy) and are members of the First Christian Church of Norman.
