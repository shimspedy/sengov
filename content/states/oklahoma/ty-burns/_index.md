## Early Life and Education

His dedication to duty and leadership skills were evident throughout his military career.

## Law Enforcement and Coaching

After retiring from the military, Ty Burns transitioned into law enforcement. For six years, he served as a sheriff's deputy, ensuring the safety and well-being of his community. But his passion extended beyond law enforcement. Burns also found fulfillment as a football and wrestling coach in the Ponca City Public Schools system.

## Stance on National Issues

After the 2020 United States presidential election, Burns joined other members of the Oklahoma Legislature in urging Oklahoma's congressional delegation to challenge the certification of the Electoral College votes.
