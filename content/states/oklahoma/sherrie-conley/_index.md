Sherrie Conley has lived in central Oklahoma since the early 1970s. She grew up on the southwest side of Oklahoma City, where she attended Moore Public Schools and graduated from Moore High School in 1981.

Conley has a bachelor’s degree in general studies from the University of Central Oklahoma with focuses in political Science, law enforcement, criminal justice, and psychology and a minor in Sociology. She received her teacher certification in 1991 and completed her master’s in education administration from Southwestern Oklahoma State University in 2016.

Conley started her teaching career in the early 1990s and then stepped away from the classroom until 2004 to stay home with her two sons while they were young.

In 2004, she reentered the classroom where she taught second through fifth grades, depending on the need of the school. She taught in rural, urban and suburban schools to prepare herself for school leadership in order to better serve the students and families of differing communities. This diversity of experience gave her a good grasp of the challenges struggling Oklahoma families face. Before becoming a state representative, Conley most recently served as an administrator for Oklahoma City Public Schools.

Conley’s family owned and operated an auto accessory store for over 10 years, experiencing the highs and lows of owning a small business in Oklahoma.

Conley is pro-life and pro-Second Amendment. She is a strong advocate for public education but also believes parents or guardians should have the option to educate their children in the setting that best meets their needs.

Sherrie and her husband Paden have been married 31 years and have two adult sons.

The Conleys attend a local church where they volunteered with the youth group while their children were in school and opened their home for many years for youth bible study.
