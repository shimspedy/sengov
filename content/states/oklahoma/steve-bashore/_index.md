Rep. Steve Bashore, R-Miami was elected to the State House of Representatives in November 2020.

Bashore currently serves as Deputy Floor Leader. He was selected to serve on House Speaker Charles McCall’s Leadership Team and is one of 24 legislators nationwide to be named to the GOPAC 2021 class of Emerging Leaders. Bashore also was selected as one of 50 legislators from 45 states chosen by the State Legislative Leaders Foundation to participate in the 2022 Emerging Legislative Leaders Program at the University of Virginia's prestigious Darden School of Business. McCall also tapped Bashore to serve as a member of the Energy Council, a non-partisan legislative organization that promotes a balanced national energy strategy and related environmental policies.

In 2023, Bashore received a Distinguished Service Award to Higher Education by the Oklahoma Regents for Higher Education Board and Presidents for his support and leadership in organizing legislators across the state to communicate the Regents’ priorities and needs.

Outside of the Legislature, Bashore is regional director for North America by the World Boxing Association.

Bashore is a conservative business leader, serving previously as general manager of Buffalo Run Casino & Resort. There he led hundreds of employees and oversaw numerous high-profile sporting events and concerts, resulting in tens of millions of dollars to positively impact the economy of his House district and the state. He also led employee efforts that resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations and countless hours of service to his House district.

Bashore is credited with reviving a struggling Oklahoma Boxing Commission as its executive director, and helped bring mixed-martial arts to Oklahoma on a professional level.

Now a nationally recognized expert on sports management, Bashore holds both a master’s of business administration degree (MBA) and a master’s degree in education in sport administration.

Bashore draws on his experience in bridging divides and fixing problems to address the needs of his House district and to advance conservative principles to improve Oklahoma.

He decided to run for office to help restore the greatness of northeast Oklahoma. Northeast Oklahoma shouldn’t be the last stop on the way out of Oklahoma, he said, it should be the first stop on the way in for residents of neighboring states.

Bashore is a steadfast supporter our military and the Second Amendment, and he is 100% pro-life. Bashore also believes in strong border security to stop the influx of criminals into our communities.

Bashore said it was his mother, Barbara Bashore, who died of cancer 19 years ago, that sparked his passion for serving others.

“My Mom was an inspiration to people, and she cared deeply about her family. She had a special way of making people feel they could accomplish anything,” he said.
