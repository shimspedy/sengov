Kevin West was born in Oklahoma City and raised in South Oklahoma City. He graduated from Douglass High School.

On an academic scholarship to Northeastern Oklahoma A & M, he studied construction and business and spent the next several years working in cabinet shops before opening his own shop in Oklahoma City.

West said owning and working with local businesses his entire career gave him a passion for building success, which has translated into working hard to build a better Oklahoma. He's committed to making his community, state and country a safer, better place to raise children, run businesses, and forge a future filled with unlimited promise.

"Together we can ensure Oklahoma remains the premier place to live, work and raise your family," he says.

West has been married to his high-school sweetheart, Goldie, for over 35 years. The two have two adult children and four grandchildren. West and his wife are active members of Regency Park Baptist Church in Moore, and both have volunteered with the Oklahoma Baptist Disaster Relief Team.
