In 2020, Rep. Eddy Dempsey was elected to represent House District 1 in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Born in Idabel, Dempsey graduated from Valliant High School and Southeastern Oklahoma State University. Prior to his election, he worked as a field representative for Congressman Markwayne Mullin. Dempsey also served on the Valliant School Board for five years.

He and his wife, Diane, have been married for over 25 years and have two sons. Their family owns a small farm in Valliant.

Rep. Dempsey's commitment to public service extends beyond legislative duties. He has actively defended Oklahoma's pro-life laws, emphasizing the importance of protecting innocent life. His stance aligns with a group of legislators and pro-life organizations who advocate for maintaining comprehensive laws that safeguard unborn babies. Rep. Dempsey's dedication to this cause reflects his unwavering commitment to the well-being of Oklahomans.

As of the 58th Legislature and continuing into the present, Rep. Eddy Dempsey represents the people of Oklahoma's 1st District with integrity and a strong sense of purpose.
