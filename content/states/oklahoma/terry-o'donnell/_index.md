Terry O’Donnell was first elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in November 2012. Even before being elected to office, however, he always had a heart for service.

Growing up in Tulsa, Terry joined the Boy Scouts of America at a young age, earning his Eagle award at just 15 years of age.

After graduating from Memorial High School, Terry attended Baylor University where he remained active in his service/social fraternity and graduated with honors, majoring in political science. Likewise, while working his way through law school at the University of Tulsa, Terry served as president of the National Honor Fraternity as well as the staff of the Law Journal. After graduating in the top 10% of his law school class, Terry was admitted to practice law in the State of Oklahoma in the fall of 1989.

After beginning his practice of law, Terry served the City of Catoosa, having been on both its Planning Commission and Zoning Board prior to his election to the State House of Representative. In addition, Terry received Martindale Hubble’s highest rating of “AV” after only seven years of practice, recognizing both his professional skills and dedication to strict ethical standards.

In 2012, Terry became Catoosa’s first-ever elected legislator. Terry’s leadership skills were recognized early by House leadership, serving as vice chair for the General Government, Judiciary and Criminal Justice and Corrections Committees during his first two terms. After his first four years in the House, Terry was selected for senior leadership in the House serving as chair of the Energy and Environment Committee, House Majority Whip and was then elected as Speaker Pro Tempore by his colleagues in the House in 2020.

During Terry’s tenure in the House, he devoted himself to Oklahoma’s conservative principles and legislation making our state a better place to work and live. In 2015, he served on the Governor’s Task Force for Criminal Justice Reform and has been recognized for his work in promoting small business (FGA Champion of Free Enterprise, 2018; Guardian of Small Business, 2020; and Guardian of Free Enterprise, 2020), protecting Oklahoma’s energy producers (NGV America Award, 2019; Clean Cities Award, 2018), strong advocacy for the Second Amendment (OK2A Award, 2021) and fighting against unnecessary taxes, fees and costs imposed upon Oklahomans (House Freedom Index Award, 2020).

A devoted father and husband, Terry has two grown daughters. He and his wife, Teresa, live in her hometown of Catoosa where she is a community leader and small business owner.
