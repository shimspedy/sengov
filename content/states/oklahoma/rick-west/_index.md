Rick West has lived in LeFlore County for more than 40 years and knows firsthand the challenges faced by residents in that area.

A small-government conservative, West is a passionate defender of the Second Amendment, the right to life and traditional family values. As a state representative, even while under heavy pressure from special interest groups, he voted against new taxes and insists government should fund its needs with existing revenues instead of increasing taxes. He also supports the rights of rural property owners and has been outspoken in his opposition to new rural zoning and intrusion.

West does not take lobbyist or Political Action Committee (PAC) money, and he refused to take the 35% pay raise given to legislators in 2019. He donates the difference to charities in his House district, and he's introduced legislation that would require a vote of the people to increase legislative pay going forward.

West is originally from Andrews, North Carolina. He graduated Mars Hill College with a Bachelor of Science in biology. He worked many years for the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture Veterinary Services as an animal and plant health inspector. He also owned poultry houses and has raised cattle for more than 40 years.
