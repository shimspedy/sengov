**Early Life and Education**
Bob Ed Culver Jr. was born on December 16, 1957, in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. His parents were Bob Ed Culver Sr. and Jo Ellen Culver (n√©e Priest). After graduating from Tahlequah High School in 1976, he pursued higher education at the University of Oklahoma. During his time there, he played as an offensive lineman for coach Barry Switzer and earned a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1981.

**Career in Oil and Gas**
Following college, Culver ventured into the oil and gas industry. He ran an independent oil and gas company near Canadian, Texas, before eventually returning to his hometown of Tahlequah with his family in 2015.

**Political Journey**
Culver's political journey began when he ran for the Oklahoma State House District 40 seat in 2016. Although he secured the Republican primary, he narrowly lost the general election to Democrat Matt Meredith by just 325 votes. Undeterred, Culver ran for the same seat again in 2020. This time, he faced Rep. Meredith once more, but the outcome was different: Culver emerged victorious, winning by approximately 1,400 votes. With this win, Oklahoma Democrats lost their last legislative seat in rural areas of the state.

**Current Role and Committees**
Since November 16, 2020, Culver has been representing the 4th district in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. As of 2021, he serves as the vice chair of the House Judiciary-Civil Committee. Additionally, he is a member of the County and Municipal Government Committee, the State and Federal Redistricting Northeast Oklahoma Subcommittee, and the Transportation Committee.

**Advocacy and Voting Record**
In 2024, Culver voted against HB 3329, which aimed to provide free menstrual products in school bathrooms. Despite his opposition, the bill passed the house floor.

**Personal Life**
Bob Ed Culver Jr. and his wife, Julie, have three children and five grandchildren. They are active members of Tahlequah First United Methodist Church. Notably, Culver's father, Bob Ed Sr., also served in the Oklahoma House of Representatives for District 4 from 1990 to 2000.
