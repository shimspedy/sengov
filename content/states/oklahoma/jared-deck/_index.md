# Jared Deck: Musician, Business Owner, and State Representative

Jared Deck wears many hatsâ€”award-winning musician, business owner, and devoted work-at-home dad. His journey to the Oklahoma House of Representatives is as diverse as his talents.

## Early Days and Musical Passion

Jared earned his Bachelor of Arts in Music Performance from Southwestern Oklahoma State University. But life wasn't all concert halls and sheet music. While pursuing his passion for music, he also worked at a factory, grinding away to pay the bills. His dedication to both his craft and his responsibilities shaped his character.

## Community Engagement

Deck's commitment extended beyond melodies and chords. He served on several boards, leaving an indelible mark on his community:
- **Moore Norman Technology Center Board of Education:** Here, he contributed to shaping educational opportunities for students.
- **Variety Care Health Centers Board of Directors:** Deck's involvement in healthcare governance highlights his concern for public well-being.
- **ACLU of Oklahoma Board of Directors:** Advocacy for civil liberties and justice drove his participation in this organization.

## Political Ascent

In June 2021, Jared Deck announced his candidacy for the Oklahoma House of Representatives, aiming to succeed Representative Emily Virgin. The Democratic primary was no cakewalk; he faced off against former Norman city councillor Kate Bierman. Deck emerged victorious, securing the Democratic Party's nomination.

The general election pitted him against Republican RJ Harris. Deck campaigned tirelessly, connecting with constituents and sharing his vision for a better Oklahoma. His hard work paid off: he won the general election with an impressive 73% of the vote.

On November 16, 2022, Jared Deck took the oath of office, officially becoming a member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. His journey from music halls to legislative chambers exemplifies resilience, community engagement, and a commitment to public service.

Representative Deck continues to advocate for his constituents, bridging the gap between the arts and politics. Whether he's strumming a guitar or debating policy, his passion shines through.
