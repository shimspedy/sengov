Nathan spent his childhood years in Broken Arrow while his parents attended Bible school. In 1994, the Dahm family moved to the Eastern European nation of Romania as missionaries to the former communist nation. Upon graduating high school, Nathan returned to Romania to serve as a missionary.

During that time, he actively served in each department of his local church and designed the 65-acre Bible school campus being built a few miles outside Romania’s capital city, Bucharest, while serving as the general manager. In 2003, Nathan stayed on as general manager and added the position of Dean of Students for the Bible school’s charter class, serving as dean for four years until returning to Broken Arrow.

Upon returning home to Oklahoma, Nathan quickly noticed the changes facing America and the many challenges lying ahead. He became actively involved in the Tulsa County Republican Party and has served on the Executive Committee, as a Precinct Chair and Vice-chair, and as the President of the Tulsa Area Republican Assembly.

Nathan currently is self-employed with his own app development company, and helps manage the cleaning company his family owns. He has worked in the past as an engineering technician for a local municipality, and as a producer for a Tulsa-based production company.

As a Constitutional Conservative, Nathan draws heavily from his experiences in the formerly communist- and currently socialist- nation of Romania to inform people of the failures, perils, and evils of socialism.

Nathan is one of the few home-school graduates to ever serve in the Senate. He serves on the General Government Committee, the Finance Committee, the Veterans & Military Affairs Committee, the Business & Commerce Committee, and the Sub-Appropriations Committee on Select Agencies.
