Senator Kristen Thompson was elected in 2022 to represent District 22, which includes areas of Oklahoma and Canadian counties.

A fourth generation Oklahoman, Thompson grew up in Fort Gibson and is a proud graduate of The University of Oklahoma.  Over the last decade, Kristen and her husband, Bryce, have started and grown multiple small businesses in the commercial construction and hospitality industries.  Cumulatively, their businesses provide over 200 quality jobs for Oklahomans in the Oklahoma City metro area.

Prior to joining the Senate, Thompson served her community in various ways.  In addition to volunteering in her children’s public schools for years, she was a member of the Visit Edmond Tourism board, representing the restaurant industry.  While on the Visit Edmond Board, Kristen also served on the youth sports and event growth strategies subcommittees, identifying opportunities to increase tourism revenue.  Currently, she serves on the Tri Delta Children’s Foundation, a 501©(3) that focuses on supporting Oklahoma’s pediatric cancer organizations.

Kristen is married to her high school sweetheart Bryce, and together they have three children: Brice, Graham, and Brooks.  The Thompson family has attended Frontline Church since 2012.
