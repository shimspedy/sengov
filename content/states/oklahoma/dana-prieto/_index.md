Senator Dana Prieto was elected to the Oklahoma Senate in 2022, proudly representing District 34 in Tulsa County.

Dana was born and raised in Amherst, New York, where he graduated from high school, then attended Niagara Community College.  While living in New York, he built a successful carpet and tile floor cleaning company, which he owned and operated until moving to Oklahoma in 1991 to attend Rhema Bible College in Broken Arrow. He also studied web design at Tulsa Community College, and is the owner and operator of Everlasting Enterprises, an online marketing company for small businesses.

The grandson of immigrants, Dana has an abiding love of American freedoms, citizenship, education and history.  While still in grade school, he became an avid reader of books on early explorers and outdoorsmen.  Learning that the American West was opened by early explorers and trappers scouting out new territory, he was inspired to learn the art of trapping. That fascination also led him to work for a while as a lumberjack.  

He also expressed an interest in learning guitar at the early age of four, which his parents encouraged, buying him a small guitar and he taught himself to play. By his early teens, he was an accomplished classical and folk guitarist.  He performed in city-wide crusades in western New York in the 1980â€™s, and in Oklahoma at both Rhema Bible Church and World Outreach Church. Senator Prieto continues to play guitar at local churches, including Millennial Church in Tulsa where he and his wife are members.
