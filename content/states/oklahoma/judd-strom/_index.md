Representative Judd Strom, a Republican, has served House District 10 since 2018. A rancher and rural firefighter from the Copan area, Strom has unfailingly prioritized rural infrastructure and government efficiency during his time in office.

A lifelong resident of northeastern Oklahoma, he was prompted to run for office by his belief in the need for a more effective government. Serving in the House has given Strom a better way to help his community and more opportunities to advocate for rural Oklahoma at the State Capitol.

His legislative accomplishments include House Bill 1095, which introduced a first-of-its-kind approach to criminal justice reform by offering offenders a reduced sentence if they afterward relocate from the area of their conviction for the length of their sentence.

Strom has also authored legislation attacking credit card fraud, increasing government efficiency and encouraging health outcomes in newborns. Additionally, his work to establish greater trade capabilities with Taiwan has moved Oklahoma to the forefront of technology development.

Since 2021, Strom has chaired the House Appropriations & Budget Subcommittee on General Government. Through this role, he oversees annual budget requests from dozens of state agencies and plays an integral part in the appropriations process while ensuring services are being delivered effectively.

Strom graduated from Pawhuska High School and attended Oklahoma State University, where he earned a degree in political science. When he's not at the State Capitol, he is hard at work on his family's ranch, which has been in his family for over 70 years.
