In 2022, Rep. John Kane was elected to represent House District 11 in the Oklahoma House of Representatives.

Kane was born and raised in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and is a multi-generational cattle rancher and business owner.

He attended the University of Kansas. After graduating, he earned a certificate from Texas Christian University’s School of Ranch Management.

After beginning a career in banking, an opportunity led him to move home to join his family’s cattle-ranching operation with his father, which he now operates with his son.

Kane and his wife, Barbara, have five children and eight grandchildren.

Kane and Barbara are involved in their church, Grace Community Church, in Bartlesville. After years of involvement with community organizations, in April 2021, Governor Stitt appointed Kane to the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Commission. Kane resigned in late 2021 to run for his current seat.
