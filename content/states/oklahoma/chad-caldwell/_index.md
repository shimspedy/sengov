Chad Caldwell grew up in Colorado but has called Enid, OK, home since 2005, as his wife, Hallie, is an Enid native.

Caldwell ran for office because he wants the best for his three children â€“ boy/girl twins and a younger daughter. He believes for them to have the best chance at success, they need to live in a state that is financially secure with traditional family values.

In addition to his role as a state representative, Caldwell has served as the Executive Director of Hospice Circle of Love since 2009. Prior to that, he worked with the University of Oklahoma Athletic Department, Garth Brooks Teammates for Kids Foundation, and Frantz Insurance Agency. Caldwell is active in the community and has served as an honorary wing commander at Vance Air Force Base in Enid as well as on the board of directors for several state and local nonprofit organizations.

Caldwell currently serves on the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), a position he was first appointed to in 2016. He has been named an Emerging Leader by the State Legislative Leadership Foundation, a Henry Tolls Leadership Fellow by the Council of State Governments, an Early Learning Fellow by the National Conference of State Legislatures, and was selected for the Center for the Advancement of Leadership Skills for the Southern Legislative Conference of the Council of State Governments.

Caldwell attended both undergraduate and graduate school at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, OK.

Caldwell and his wife, Hallie, have been married since 2001. The family attends church at Sojourn Enid.
