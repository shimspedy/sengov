Sen. Seifried ("Sy-fred") was first elected to the Oklahoma Senate in 2022. Born and raised in Claremore, she is a proud ninth-generation Oklahoman. She graduated high school from Claremore Christian School, and then graduated Summa Cum Laude from Rogers State University with a degree in political science.

She played basketball her entire life, which earned her an athletic scholarship for the RSU women’s basketball team. This is where she met her husband, JP, who was on the men’s baseball team. They attend church together in Claremore.

Ally currently works in her family's small business as the special projects manager when she is not at the Capitol. She has also worked in branding and marketing, in addition to working as the development specialist for Safenet Services, a domestic abuse and sexual assault prevention agency, serving Rogers and Tulsa Counties.

In her free time, Ally enjoys playing tennis with her USTA team.
