Marcus McEntire is a fourth-generation Stephens County resident who attended both Comanche and Duncan Public Schools. After graduating from Duncan High School, he earned a degree in communication studies from the University of Oklahoma, a Master of Divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and a Master of Arts in Sociology from the University of Virginia. He received a full fellowship from the University of Virginia with main areas of concentration in sociology of law, religion and the family.

In 2003, Marcus, his wife, Leigh, and son returned to Duncan - the community they love - to raise their family and expand their young and rapidly growing small business, Distinctive-Decor.com. Their daughter was born in 2006.

Currently, Marcus and Leigh own two small businesses in Duncan – Whitten Insurance Agency and Distinctive Décor. Both are located on Main Street. Their businesses have received numerous accolades including Top 10 outstanding Oklahoma entrepreneurs, the National Honor Roll of American Entrepreneurs, and platinum sales status with multiple product lines sold in their store.

Marcus serves the Duncan community in many ways. He was president of the Duncan Rotary Club and served on the Duncan Regional Hospital Foundation Board. He was on the Advisory Committee for the Business Development Services Program at Red River Technology Center and was involved with Duncan Public Schools, serving on the Gifted and Talented and STEM advisory boards. Marcus served as a Boy Scout leader for Troop 4434, while his son worked toward his Eagle Scout rank.

The McEntires have attended the First United Methodist Church in Duncan since their return in 2003, first visiting the church with Marcus’s grandmother. Over the years, Marcus has held a variety of positions at the church from Sunday school teacher to worship leader, liturgist, staff perish relations committee member, finance committee member, trustee and more.

In the House, Marcus has become a leader in health care reform, including drafting legislation that established the state's plan to manage Medicaid expansion approved by state voters, regulating pharmacy benefit management companies, and helping to create Oklahoma's Health Information Exchange. His other areas of policy expertise include insurance, business, and alcohol modernization.
