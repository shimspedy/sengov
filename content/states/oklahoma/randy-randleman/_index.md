Dr. Randy Randleman has a passion for children. As a mental health expert and foremost authority on classroom management and discipline, Randy has worked in 155 school districts and 135 head start centers across Oklahoma, including those in his very own District 15.

Randy is certified as a teacher, counselor, principal, psychometrist, superintendent, and licensed psychologist. Randy earned his associate’s degree at Northeastern Oklahoma A&M, his bachelor’s degree at the University of Tulsa, a master’s degree in counseling at Northeastern State University, and was certified in school psychology and psychometry at Oklahoma State University. He earned his Ph.D. at OSU in a combined program focusing on school and clinical psychology. Randy’s dissertation was “Managing Aggressive Children in the Classroom,” and he has also helped develop an alternative education program that received national awards.

Randy has worked with troubled and challenged kids for his entire life to help restore hope and find a path for success. Helping humanity succeed is his life’s mission, and he is honored to bring his expertise as a psychologist to the Oklahoma House of Representatives as he represents the interests of his constituents in District 15. Randy works to bring mental health issues to the forefront of minds in the Capitol building.

Legislation that’s good for District 15 is where Randy’s heart and vote will be. “If it’s good for my neighbors, then it will get my vote,” he said. “When I was elected to this seat, I became the representative for all of the people in District 15, whether Democrat or Republican or otherwise.”

Though Randy is a doctor, he came from very humble beginnings. Growing up in the community of Wilson, north of Henryetta, he shared the country life with his two brothers and one sister. In their home, Randy’s father was the disciplinarian while his mother was the prayer warrior.

Working with his father who could do almost anything, Randy gained experience in a wide variety of activities, including farming, ranching, building houses, and overhauling cars, to name a few. Randy’s friends are farmers, lawyers, teachers, and mothers and fathers of some of Oklahoma’s most troubled youth.

Randy’s wife, Jennifer is a school psychologist. The two of them love to travel, and outdoor activities are very much a part of the Randlemans’ life, from golf to hunting. Once a year Randy’s family, including his five children and three grandchildren, gather for a reunion on Eufaula Lake. Randy and Jennifer attend Community Culture Church where their son is pastor.
