Mark was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2016.

He believes the key to Oklahoma’s prosperity begins with our families at home. His primary focus during his legislative service has been children and family issues. Mark has championed legislation to strengthen families and reduce childhood trauma.

Mark spent many years advocating for children and families before being elected. His work at the Youth Services of Tulsa’s Safe Place program and the Children’s Hospital at Saint Francis gave him firsthand experience to the struggles many of our families face. Mark also served as a CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) for abused and neglected children in Creek County, and is a former chairman of the Youth Services of Creek County’s board of directors.

Currently, Mark serves as Chairman for the Appropriations and Budget subcommittee for Human Services, which oversees 10% of the entire state budget. Additionally, he serves on the full Appropriations and Budget committee and the standing committees on Government Efficiency and Children, Youth & Family Services.

Mark holds a Bachelor’s of Science in Health Education from Oklahoma State University and is currently enrolled as a Master’s student at the University of Oklahoma in the Public Administration program.

Mark and his wife, Pam, have two wonderful children. Asher is a multiple sport athlete, and they welcomed their beautiful daughter, Ivy Ruth, in April 2020.
