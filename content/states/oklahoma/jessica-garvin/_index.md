Sen. Jessica Garvin was first elected to the state Senate in 2020 to represent Senate District 43, encompassing communities in Garvin, Grady, McClain, Cleveland and Stephens counties.

The Duncan Republican is a proud graduate of Marlow High School and the University of Oklahoma, where she obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in communication and a minor in psychology.

In addition to serving as a state Senator, Garvin is a former nursing home and assisted living administrator. Garvin serves as the executive vice president of Bison Health Care Management, offering business management for healthcare companies, and founded Four-One-Four, a public relations firm, in 2022. She is also the former co-owner of Kindful Hospice, and although she is no longer working in the long-term care industry, she is a fierce advocate for senior adults at the Capitol.

In her spare time, Garvin is an avid sportswoman who loves hunting and fishing. She and her husband, Stephen, have three children and have also served as foster parents.
