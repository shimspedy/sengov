Tom Gann was born in Wagoner and grew up in Tahlequah where he later graduated from Northeastern State University with degrees in marketing and accounting.

A limited government conservative, Gann has a lifetime of experience as a small businessman. In 1984, he started his first small business in Ft. Gibson selling gas and groceries to the local community. The business grew to 12 employees until being sold in 1996.

In addition to his own business, Gann developed other commercial properties, which brought new restaurants and an auto repair business into the community.

Over the years, Gann has responded to the call to defend American values and principles.

He served five years on the Ft. Gibson School Board where he stood firm against a top-down, socialist, federal takeover of public education known as Outcomes Based Education. He successfully brought an end to the pilot program, which had forced the school district to participate in the federal effort.

This experience led Tom to seek higher office.

Gann has served as a Republican State Committeeman and as a past member of the Republican Party's Platform Committee.

In office, Gann does not take lobbyist or Political Action Committee (PAC) money. He is one of only two lawmakers who refused to take the 35% pay raise given to the legislature in 2019. He donates the difference to various charities and benefits in his House district.

In 2018, Gann served on the House Special Investigative Committee where waste and mismanagement by the Oklahoma Department of Health was exposed. In 2019 Gann followed up on the findings of that committee by co-authoring Senate Bill 316 with Senator Nathan Dahm. This bill requires greater transparency of agencies with regards to state funds and relationships agencies form with each other. The bill was signed by Governor Stitt and became law November 1st, 2019.

As Chairman of the Administrative Rules Committee, Gann played a crucial role in improving oversight and efficiency within state government by hosting an interim study that resulted in the passage of SB913 by Senator Julie Daniels. This bill created the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules with the Senate increasing transparency and scrutiny over the process. This enhances the "Break the Tape" initiative that Governor Stitt started to reduce the impact of the regulatory code on businesses and taxpayers in Oklahoma. Recently, Gann also has been very instrumental in seeking an end to abusive vaccine mandates. He proposed legislation that reaffirms a person's right to say no to experimental vaccines and other unwanted medical mandates with the "Liberty Bill".

In addition to his other experience, Gann is retired from serving as the Airports Auditor for the Tulsa International Airport.

Gann and his wife, Debbie, have been married 44 years. They are parents of three children and have eight grandchildren as well as a Corgi named Hank.

The Ganns attend church in the Inola area and have been instrumental in forming and supporting crisis pregnancy centers and promoting abstinence education.
