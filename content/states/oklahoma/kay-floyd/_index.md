P. Kay Floyd graduated from Oklahoma State University in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology, a minor degree in political science, and a minor degree in philosophy. After graduating from OSU, Senator Floyd attended law school at the University of Oklahoma where she received her Juris Doctor degree.

After two years in private practice, Senator Floyd became an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma working in both the civil and criminal divisions. In 1987, Senator Floyd accepted the position of Deputy Executive Director for the Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission.

In 1989, Senator Floyd was appointed as an Administrative Law Judge for the State of Oklahoma and served in that capacity for 22 years. Her appointment made her one of the youngest women in Oklahoma history to receive a judicial appointment. During that time she also served as a Special Municipal Court Judge for the City of Oklahoma City.

Along with her judicial duties, Senator Floyd has been an adjunct professor at Oklahoma State University and an attorney for the senior citizens division of Legal Aid of Western Oklahoma. Senator Floyd has worked as a volunteer on the Citizens Action Committee for the Oklahoma City Animal Shelter and as a member of the Oklahoma Bar Association’s Women in Law committee. She also serves as an Advisory Council Member for Palomar Family Justice Center and is a former member of ReMerge Board of Directors.

Senator Floyd has served on the OKC AIDS Walk Board of Directors and is a member of the Board of Directors of Lyric Theatre in Oklahoma City.

Senator Floyd was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 2012, and then to the Oklahoma Senate in 2014, where she became the first woman ever to serve as Democratic Leader, a position she has held since 2018. While in the Senate, Senator Floyd focused on improving the state’s education system and working for Oklahoma’s women and children. She has authored bills to provide suicide prevention training in Oklahoma’s schools, require potential guardians to undergo background checks, better assist victims of sexual and domestic violence, protect consumers, and legislation designating Lyric Theatre of Oklahoma as the state’s official theatre.

In 2014, Senator Floyd authored the Lethality Assessment Act which made Oklahoma the first in the nation to establish such a program. In 2019, she authored legislation to address Oklahoma’s backlog of untested rape kits through standardizing the guidelines for testing rape kits and creating a statewide tracking system for collecting sexual assault evidence. The legislation also expands continuing education for law enforcement on how to properly address sexual assault reports.

Senator Floyd currently serves on the Appropriations, General Government, Judiciary and Rules Committees as well as the Joint Committee on State-Tribal Relations.
