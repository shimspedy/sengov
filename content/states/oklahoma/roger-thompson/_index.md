Senator Roger Thompson was first elected to the Oklahoma State Senate in November 2014. He represents Senate District 8, which is comprised of Okmulgee, Okfuskee and McIntosh counties as well as portions of Creek and Muskogee counties.

Thompson is the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, vetting all legislation with a fiscal impact on the state, including all budget bills.  He also serves as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Pandemic Relief Funding.  The committee and its working groups are charged with vetting recommendations for the utilization of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds. In addition, Thompson serves as co-chair of the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency (LOFT) oversight committee. He’s also a member of the Finance and Rules Committees. He was also appointed to serve on the Executive Committee of The Council of State Governments Southern Office (CSG South) for 2023.

Born in Oklahoma City, Thompson lived in Okmulgee County, and graduated from Muskogee High School.  He later graduated from the Preston Road School of Preaching in Texas, then attended Southwestern Bible College and Seminary where he received his master’s and a doctorate in theology.

Even before coming to the Oklahoma Senate, Thompson had long been involved in public service through a variety of organizations.  He was a lay member of the Professional Responsibility Commission of the Oklahoma Bar Association and served on the Okfuskee County Election Board as well as the Okfuskee County Excise Board.  He’s a past president of the Okemah Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture, the Oklahoma Lions Club, and the Rock Creek Youth Camp in Norman, Oklahoma.  Thompson also served as board president and CEO for Good News International Foundation, where he was recognized for partnering with the Secretary of Religion and Science in Ukraine.  He also operated a publishing and benevolent outreach in Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union.  During that period, he also served as an advisory member of Global Christian University.

In 2022, Senator Thompson was named as one of the 55 most influential Oklahomans over the age of 55. The 55 Over 55 award is the creation of Donald B. Swift, founder of ion Oklahoma Magazine, featuring Oklahomans who do not believe their best years are behind them and are leading the way and involved in projects that are creating a better future for the state and its citizens.

Thompson is president of the News Leader Company, Inc., which owns and publishes the Okemah News Leader.  His wife, Pamela, owns Pamela’s Flowers and Okemah Office Supply.
