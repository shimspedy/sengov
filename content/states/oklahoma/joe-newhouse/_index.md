Senator Joe Newhouse is a life-long Oklahoman, serving the Tulsa metro area he grew up in. Joe attended Broken Arrow Public Schools K-12, where he played basketball, ran track, and served as junior class vice president. As a high school senior, he studied as an exchange student in Germany. Joe graduated from Georgetown University with a major in international economics. Joe graduated #1 in his masterâ€™s program at Chapman University, Los Angeles, Calif., and earned certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP) and Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.

After college, Newhouse would go on to become a jet pilot in the US Navy. Assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, then Lt. Newhouse flew multiple combat missions in the EA-6B Prowler during the Iraq War, providing aerial coverage to Marine convoys over Fallujah and Baghdad, ultimately earning the Air Medal. He has 186 carrier trapped landings.

After the war he was selected to teach fighter tactics at Navy Flight School in Pensacola, FL, where he was later named Instructor Pilot of the Year. He qualified as Expert in both pistol and M-16 and tested fluent in two foreign languages. Upon completion of active duty service and returning to Tulsa, Joe started his own real estate investment firm and affiliated with the Navy Reserve.

With over 22 years of military service, he continues to serve part time in the Navy Reserve as a Commander where he has completed three overseas US Special Operations Forces (USSOF) combat tours, including a deployment in 2021 in which he oversaw USSOF future operations in Somalia and was awarded the Defense Meritorious Service Medal.

Joe served as a field representative for then US Rep. Jim Bridenstine for three years before winning his own state senate election in 2016. Joe was re-elected in 2020 and is proud to continue serving the citizens of Senate District 25: Bixby, South Tulsa, Glenpool, and Jenks. He is most proud though to be the father of five incredible children and married to his best friend, Meghan Newhouse.
