Dave is extremely honored to serve District 39 as 47 of his 63 years have been lived within the boundaries of the District.  From his elementary school years at Benjamin Franklin, through Woodrow Wilson Junior High, and then graduating from Will Rogers High School (it was there he met Janet), Dave has always been proud to call himself a Tulsan.

Dave’s grandfather and grandmother are on the rolls of establishing Felt Public Schools in Felt, Oklahoma. His Mother and Father were both children of share-croppers. His Dad graduated high school in Arkansas, while his Mom was always proud to be a Preston Pirate.

Even after graduating from high school Dave continued to stay in Tulsa to attend the University of Tulsa.  There he majored in Mechanical Engineering, and played football as a quarterback.  After a brief stint in the NFL he started his engineering career first in New York City and then back to Tulsa.  

Still having the urge to be involved in football, Dave began coaching college football in 1983 and would continue for 22 seasons covering parts of 4 decades. Dave is best known for his 12 seasons as head coach of the University of Tulsa. Other stops included the University of Alabama, Mississippi State University, and the University of Mississippi.

Dave was recognized as one of the Young Oklahomans of the Year in 1989, and was awarded the NCAA District Coach of the Year honor in 1991 after his Freedom Bowl Champion University of Tulsa team finished 22nd in the national polls. He was appointed to the American Football Coaches Association Ethics Committee, and served as the representative of Independent Universities to the now defunct College Football Association. His Tulsa teams consistently graduated at a higher rate than the University body in general.

Outside of coaching, Dave has worked and now works in the energy industry mainly in the midstream sector.  Previous fields encountered were the IT industry, submersible pump, and transportation, as well.

Dave is a graduate of the University of Tulsa with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Presently, Dave sits on the boards of John 3:16 Mission, Tulsa Public Schools Athletic Hall of Fame, Will Rogers High School Community Foundation, First Baptist Church of Tulsa Deacon, and Secretary of Oklahoma Former NFL Players Association. In 2008, Dave was awarded the Merv Johnson Integrity in Coaching Award by The National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame Oklahoma Chapter.
