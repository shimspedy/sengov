Randy Grellner, a member of the Republican Party, serves in the Oklahoma State Senate representing District 21. He assumed office on November 20, 2024, and his current term is set to end on November 22, 2028.

Randy Grellner, also known as "Doc," has a rich background in both medicine and public service. He graduated from Kingfisher High School and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in agricultural economics from Oklahoma State University in 1988. Later, he pursued his passion for healthcare and obtained a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree from the Oklahoma State University College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1998.

Throughout his career, Grellner has been deeply involved in his community. He operated a medical practice in Cushing, Oklahoma, and served as the vice president of the Cushing Public Schools board from 2013 to 2019. In 2014, he founded the Cushing Urgent Care facility, which he successfully managed until selling it in 2019. His dedication to public health was further recognized when Governor Kevin Stitt appointed him to the Oklahoma State Board of Health in October 2021.

In addition to his medical and administrative accomplishments, Grellner has demonstrated a strong commitment to public service through his role in the Oklahoma State Senate. His leadership and experience continue to shape his contributions to the state and his constituents in District 21.
