Paul proudly served our country for 25 years in the U.S. Navy, retiring at the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer (E9/Navy’s highest enlisted rank). For nearly ten years, Paul was stationed at Tinker Air Force Base, where he served in Strategic Communications Wing ONE in support of their fleet of E-6B aircraft.

At his retirement, Paul led a team of nearly 200 military and civilian personnel responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the E-6B fleet. A decorated veteran, Paul held a Top Secret security clearance and received numerous awards and commendations, including Company Commander of the Year and Squadron Sailor of the Year.

A Successful Small Businessman

After retiring from the military in 2006, Paul earned a real estate license and started selling homes. Paul worked his way up, and, by 2009, he had earned a broker’s license and opened his own business, Rosino Realty.

Today, the family owned-and-operated business has helped many Oklahomans throughout the Moore, Yukon and south Oklahoma City areas achieve the American Dream and own their own home.

A Man of Faith, Father and Grandfather

Paul has two adult children (both Westmoore High School graduates) and three grandchildren.

Paul is a member of St. Andrews Church in Moore. From serving as a Sunday school teacher and base coordinator for food and homeless shelter programs while stationed in Hawaii, to his work with Habitat for Humanity and the Moore Community Center after area tornadoes while stationed at Tinker, Paul has always tried to put his Christian faith into action.

Committed to Kids and Education

For many years, Paul coached little league baseball and served as a volunteer coach for the Westmoore Little Jaguars elementary and junior high wrestling program. A strong supporter of higher education, Paul is a magna cum laude graduate of Mid America Christian University, holding a Bachelor of Science degree in Management and Ethics.
