Sen. Warren Hamilton was first elected to the state Senate in 2020 to represent District 7, which includes communities in Haskell, Latimer, Pittsburg, southern Sequoyah & northwest Leflore counties. Hamilton is the first Senator in state history from McCurtain, Okla.

The Republican grew up on a ranch run by his parents, who were both school teachers. He joined the Army in 1989 when he reported to the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.

He was elected by his teammates to be the captain of the Army Powerlifting Team, which won the Collegiate National Championship in 1993. Hamilton finished 3rd in the 242 pound class. He graduated in 1993 and reported to flight school at Fort Rucker, Al., earning his wings in 1994.  He flew AH-1 Cobras at Fort Bliss and Fort Carson, and scout helicopters in Bosnia and Fort Polk, La, serving as a platoon leader, company commander and liaison officer.

In 2001, he was selected by the Army to serve as the Army exchange pilot to the Marine Corps. Upon completion of the Instructor Pilot course at Fort Rucker, he reported for duty at Camp Pendleton. From 2001 to 2005, he flew AH-1W Cobras (twin engine) operationally with Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 367, serving as an instructor and flight lead, and in a variety of leadership positions.  His squadron deployed to Japan, Thailand, the Philippine Islands, and ultimately to Iraq.
Hamilton completed his service obligation in 2005 with the rank of major and returned home to the ranch he grew up on.  In 2006, he returned to Iraq, this time as a defense contractor, flying helicopters in Iraq and Afghanistan until his last flight in 2012, whereupon he returned home to Oklahoma, to his wife, Sherrie. They own and operate Rocky Point Ranch and have four children ranging in age from 30 to 7, plus two amazing grandchildren.

In 2022, Hamilton completed training and certification as a reserve deputy sheriff in Haskell county, opening another avenue of service to his community.  Hamilton’s service in the Senate is focused on protecting children and the innocent.  To that end, Hamilton has been an author or co author of several pieces of legislation whose aim is to better equip law enforcement to fulfill their duties.  Further, he is instrumental in legislation protecting children from genital mutilation, protecting children from communist indoctrination in the forms of critical race theory and DEI, protecting children form pornography in school and public libraries, protecting children from being executed before they’re born, and honoring our Christian founding fathers.  Hamilton authored the Second Amendment Sanctuary State law to safeguard Oklahomans from any further infringement upon our Second Amendment rights.  

Hamilton is also an advocate for veterans, serving on the Senate Veterans and Military Affairs committee and currently as the Vice Chairman.  Also, he was selected to represent the Senate on the Oklahoma Strategic Military Planning Commission.  He remains committed to a strong national defense and ensuring that Oklahoma is the top state for veterans and their families.  
Hamilton is a devoted Christian and patriotic American and is grateful for the opportunity to serve both his state and country.
