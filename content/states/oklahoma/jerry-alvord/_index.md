Sen. Jerry Alvord and his wife, Shelly, entered public service after building successful careers as independent owners, creating businesses from the ground up, including a flourishing cow/calf operation on their Carter County ranch, along with their diverse business portfolio. Their businesses have been successful based on sound fiscal principles, communication, and strategic development. In decades of building relationships in southern Oklahoma, Jerry treasures the beauty of the land but, more importantly, realized the state's most precious resource is its people. In an effort to give back to his community, he decided to apply lessons learned in business to successfully run for public office.

Alvord served as a Carter County Commissioner for eight years, taking a lead role in repurposing the donated Noble Energy facility into consolidated housing for county offices. This included updating and thoughtfully remodeling the historic, early 1900s built Carter County Courthouse. Alvord also made significant strides to improve infrastructure that had been severely damaged by the historic flooding in 2015. While a County Commissioner, Alvord served on the State Board of Directors for the Association of County Commissioners and was a Committee Member for Legislative Oversight.

Jerry is also a successful horseman and has trained several World Champion and Top 5 horses. He is a fierce competitor and is both an AQHA World Champion team roper and has won multiple World Championships in working cowhorse events. These results can only be achieved through a strong work ethic, determination and the ability to problem solve, all attributes he also brings to work in state government.

Alvord is an NRA-certified handgun instructor, member of the Oklahoma Second Amendment Association, the Noble Foundation, Oklahoma Cattlemen's Association and Oklahoma Farm Bureau. He is also a proud graduate of Leadership Ardmore and Leadership Oklahoma, as well as a presenter for the Oklahoma Hall of Fame induction ceremonies.

He has the love and support of his wife Shelly, a Stage 4 cancer survivor. She is a nationally accredited Senior Professional in Human Resources (SPHR) and has taken on more responsibility running the couple's variety of businesses as Jerry focuses on serving Senate District 14. The couple are active members of Crosspoint Fellowship Church, where he serves as an elder and financial counselor.
