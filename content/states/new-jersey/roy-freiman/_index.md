Roy Freiman is an American Democratic Party politician who has represented the 16th Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly since 2018. He replaced Jack Ciattarelli, who did not seek re-election to his seat in order to run unsuccessfully for Governor of New Jersey in the 2017 primaries.

Freiman, a resident of Hillsborough Township, graduated from the State University of New York at Oneonta with a bachelor's degree in business finance and also attended Brunel University London. He holds the designations of Chartered Life Underwriter and Chartered Financial Consultant. Prior to his political career, Freiman worked for over 20 years at Prudential Financial, where he held the position of vice president of strategy and analytics. In 2017, he served on the Hillsborough Township Sustainability Committee.

As a member of the New Jersey General Assembly, Freiman has been actively involved in various committees. He currently chairs the Agriculture and Food Security Committee and is a member of the Commerce and Economic Development and Financial Institutions and Insurance committees. His commitment to finding cost-saving solutions and making smart investments for Central Jersey's future has been a driving force in his political career.

In the 2023 general election, Freiman was re-elected to the Assembly, securing 28.3% of the vote. His running mate, Mitchelle Drulis, also won, ensuring that both Assembly seats from the district remained in Democratic hands.
