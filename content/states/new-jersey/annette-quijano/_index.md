Annette M. Quijano (born July 4, 1962) is an accomplished Democratic Party politician hailing from New Jersey. She has been serving as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly since September 25, 2008. Quijano was selected by Union County Democrats to succeed Neil M. Cohen, who resigned amid allegations of child pornography on an official computer.

**Early Life and Education:**
Quijano is a native of New Jersey and the daughter of Puerto Rican parents. She resides in Elizabeth, New Jersey. She earned her Bachelor of Science in Management from Rutgers University and went on to obtain her Juris Doctor from Rutgers School of Law–Newark in 1991. Her legal career began with clerkships at the New Jersey Superior Court in Newark and in Trenton, where she worked at both the Office of the Governor's Counsel and the New Jersey Department of the Public Advocate. Quijano holds bar admissions in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

**Professional Journey:**
Throughout her career, Quijano has held various significant roles. She served as an Assistant Counsel to Governors Jim McGreevey, Richard Codey, and Jon Corzine. Additionally, she worked as a Compliance Manager for Prudential/Aetna U.S. Healthcare and practiced law in civil practice. Notably, she was Chief of Staff to State Senator Raymond Lesniak from 1992 to 1994. Her commitment to public service extends to her involvement with the United Way Hispanic Advisory Council of Union County, the Governor's Working Group for Hispanic Affairs, and a Legal Services committee in Elizabeth. Quijano has also been a Commissioner for New Jersey's Congressional Redistricting efforts. Her dedication has earned her accolades, including the Excellence in State Government Leadership and Women of Excellence in Government awards. In her free time, she mentors young adults, encouraging them to consider law and graduate school.

**Historical Significance:**
Quijano made history as the first woman and first minority to represent the 20th District in the New Jersey General Assembly. Her selection followed the resignation of Neil Cohen, who left office due to the child pornography scandal. Union County Democrats chose Quijano over Patricia Perkins-Auguste to fill the vacant seat. Since then, she has been a steadfast advocate for her constituents and a trailblazer in New Jersey politics.

Annette M. Quijano continues to serve her community with dedication and integrity, leaving a lasting impact on New Jersey's legislative landscape.
