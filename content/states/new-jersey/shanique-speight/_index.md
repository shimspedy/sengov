Shanique Davis Speight (born November 14, 1978) is an American Democratic Party politician who represents the 29th Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly since 2018. She succeeded Blonnie R. Watson, who chose not to run for reelection. Speight has served in the Assembly as the Deputy Parliamentarian since 2022.

Early Life and Education:
A resident of Newark, Speight graduated from Lincoln University with a Master of Arts in Human Services. She also serves as an officer in the Essex County Sheriff's Office. In 2007, she was first elected to the Newark Public Schools Advisory Board and served as the board's vice chair from 2007 to 2012. Additionally, she worked as an aide to Senator Teresa Ruiz from 2009 to 2010.

Political Career:
After Donald Payne Jr. vacated his at-large seat on the Newark City Council, Speight was nominated by Mayor Cory Booker in November 2012 to fill the vacant seat. However, a New Jersey Superior Court judge ruled that Booker did not have the power to cast a deciding vote under the circumstances, leading to Speight vacating the seat. Despite this setback, she continued her political journey.

In the November 2017 general election, with Blonnie Watson not seeking re-election, Speight (with 18,308 votes; 43.0% of all ballots cast) and her running mate, incumbent Eliana Pintor Marin (with 19,088; 44.8%), defeated Republican challengers to win both Assembly seats from the district for the Democrats.

Committees:
- Aging and Human Services: Chair
- Regulated Professions: Vice-Chair
- Health
