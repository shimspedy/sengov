Andrea Katz is an American Democratic Party politician serving as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly for the 8th legislative district. She took office on January 9, 2024. Katz was raised in Pennsylvania and attended Pennsbury High School and Bucks County Community College. Currently residing in Chesterfield Township, New Jersey, Katz previously served on the board of education of the Chesterfield School District.

In the 2023 New Jersey General Assembly election, Democrat Katz secured the second seat by defeating Republican incumbent Brandon Umba. Her victory marked a significant shift, as it gave Democrats in the Assembly a sixth seat flipped from Republicans. Katz's win also made her the first elected Democrat to represent the 8th district since John A. Sweeney in 1974.

The 8th legislative district comprises Atlantic and Burlington counties. Katz's committee assignments include Commerce, Economic Development, and Agriculture; Environment, Natural Resources, and Solid Waste; and Transportation and Independent Authorities.

As a mother of three and a public policy advocate, Katz is committed to addressing affordability issues, advocating for affordable healthcare, quality public schools, job opportunities, and smart public policies.
