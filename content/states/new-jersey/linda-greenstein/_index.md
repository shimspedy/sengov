Linda Greenstein is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Democratic Party. She has been serving as a representative of the New Jersey State Senate, representing District 14 since 2011. Her current term is set to end on January 11, 2028.

Born on June 7, 1950, in Brooklyn, New York, Greenstein graduated from Andrew Jackson High School in Queens. She earned her Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Vassar College in 1971, followed by a Master's degree in Psychology from Johns Hopkins University in 1974. She later pursued law and was awarded a J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1984.

Before her political career, Greenstein worked as a staff attorney for the Community Health Law Project from 1991 to 2000. She also served as a Clinical Associate Professor at Seton Hall Law School, a Deputy Attorney General for the State of New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice, and an attorney with Smith, Stratton, Wise, Heher, and Brennan.

Greenstein's political journey began with her service on the Plainsboro Township Committee from 1995 to 2000 and on the West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District's Board of Education from 1992 to 1994. She was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, representing District 14 from 2000 to 2010.

In the 2010 special election, Greenstein was elected to the New Jersey Senate. She was then reelected for her first full term in 2011. She made history as the first woman to represent the 14th Legislative District in the Senate. The district includes Cranbury, Jamesburg, Monroe, Plainsboro, and Spotswood in Middlesex County and East Windsor, Hamilton, Hightstown, and Robbinsville in Mercer County.

As a full-time legislator, Greenstein serves as the Assistant Majority Leader of the State Senate and the Chairwoman of the Law and Public Safety Committee. She also serves as the Vice-Chairwoman of the Environment and Energy Committee and as a member of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee and the Joint Committee on the Public Schools.

Throughout her political career, Greenstein has been a strong advocate for New Jersey's children and families. She was a prime sponsor of Caylee's Law, which makes it a felony for failing to report the disappearance of a child within 24 hours. She also sponsored legislation expanding Megan's Law, protecting children from known sex offenders, and authored Jessica Rogers' Law, which protects New Jerseyans against drivers with road rage.

Greenstein is also a prime sponsor of New Jersey's Paid Family Leave Law, which allows workers to apply for up to six weeks of paid leave to care for a newborn or newly adopted child, or a sick parent, spouse, or child. She has also authored legislation to increase school bus safety.

In addition to her work on family and child protection, Greenstein has supported efforts to decrease the state's reliance on fossil fuels by promoting electric cars and has advocated for making clean and renewable energy a priority for New Jersey by increasing the state's renewable energy portfolio.

Greenstein's dedication to public service and her commitment to the people of New Jersey's 14th District have made her a respected figure in the state's political landscape.
