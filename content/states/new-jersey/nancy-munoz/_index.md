Nancy Ann Foster Munoz, commonly known as Nancy Munoz, was born on September 8, 1954. She is an American Republican Party politician who has served in the New Jersey General Assembly since 2009, representing the 21st Legislative District. Here's a detailed biography of her life and political career:

A resident of Summit, Nancy Muñoz has been an assemblywoman since 2009, serving as Republican budget officer since January 2024. She was deputy minority leader from 2022 to 2023, conference leader from 2019 to 2021 and Republican whip from 2017 to 2018.

One of the Assembly's most knowledgeable members on health care, Muñoz has vast experience working in some of the nation's best hospitals. During her more than 35-year nursing career, she practiced surgical intensive care at Yale-New Haven Hospital; at Massachusetts General in Boston, which is the original and largest teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School; and Memorial-Sloan Kettering in New York City - the second best cancer treatment center in the nation. She earned her bachelor's degree in nursing from Skidmore College in 1976 and a master's from Hunter College in 1983 as a clinical nurse specialist.

The mother of five children, she was president of the Summit PTA for elementary, middle and high school, and on the board of the former preschool at St. John's Lutheran Church serving low-income children.
