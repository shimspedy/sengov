Craig John Coughlin (born January 31, 1958) is an American Democratic Party politician who has represented the 19th Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly since 2010. He has served as the Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly since 2018, making him the longest-serving Speaker in the Assembly's history.

## Early Life
Born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, Coughlin grew up in South Amboy and graduated from South Amboy Middle High School in 1976. He received a B.S. degree in 1980 from St. John's University and a J.D. degree in 1983 from St. John's University School of Law. Before entering politics, Coughlin served on the Board of Education of the South Amboy Public Schools from 1983 to 1987. In 1987, he was elected to the South Amboy City Council, where he served until 1993. He worked as an attorney before becoming a municipal court judge for Edison Township in 2005. Coughlin lived in Woodbridge Township, NJ, and his children attended the Woodbridge Township School District.

## Controversy
In 2016, shortly after becoming Assembly Speaker, Coughlin formed the law firm Rainone Coughlin Minchello. His firm included four other attorneys who had previously worked for Decotiis FitzPatrick & Cole LLP, providing legal services to municipal and county governments totaling $14 million in FY2016. By 2017, Coughlin's firm secured contracts with dozens of local municipalities, totaling over $1 million. His law firm currently provides for-profit legal counsel to the Middlesex County Improvement Authority and recently acquired a $150,000 public contract with North Brunswick to fulfill the position of Municipal Attorney. The Middlesex County Improvement Authority was awarded a $70 million contract by NJ Transit to manage the North Brunswick Train station project. Coughlin denies any conflicts of interest or involvement with respect to Middlesex County's or the improvement authority's discussions with the state concerning North Brunswick transit village and never had any intention of performing any work in connection with this project.

## New Jersey Assembly
Coughlin resigned from the court in 2009 to run for the General Assembly seat vacated by Joseph Vas. He won the election and has been serving in the Assembly since then. His current term ends on January 13, 2026. As a member of the New Jersey General Assembly, he represents District 19, which includes municipalities such as Carteret, Perth Amboy, Sayreville, South Amboy, and Woodbridge.
