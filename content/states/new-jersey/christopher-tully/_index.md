Peter Christopher Tully (born March 31, 1982) is an American Democratic Party politician who has represented the 38th Legislative District in the New Jersey Assembly since 2018. For the 2022-23 legislative session, he serves as the Deputy Majority Leader.

Raised in Bergenfield, Tully graduated from Bergenfield High School and Northeastern University. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Northeastern University.

Tully's political career includes serving on the Borough of Bergenfield council from 2009 to 2017, during which he held the position of Council President in 2011 and 2014. Additionally, he previously worked as an aide to U.S. Representative Josh Gottheimer.

In May 2018, Tully and Lisa Swain were appointed to the New Jersey General Assembly's 38th District seats after Assemblymen Joseph Lagana and Tim Eustace resigned from their positions. In the subsequent special election to complete the unexpired Assembly terms, Swain and Tully defeated Republicans Gail Horton and Jayme Ouellete.

Tully has been actively involved in legislative matters. In 2020, he co-sponsored Assembly Bill 4454 (now N.J.S.A. 18A:35-4.36a), which mandates that a curriculum on diversity and inclusion be part of the school curriculum for students in kindergarten through twelfth grade.

His committee assignments for the 2024-2025 Legislative Session include:
- Chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee
- Vice-chair of the Commerce, Economic Development, and Agriculture Committee
- Member of the Health Committee

In the 2023 general election, Tully secured re-election alongside Lisa Swain, both representing the Democratic Party in the 38th Legislative District. The 2021 general election also saw their successful re-election.

Tully continues to play an active role in New Jersey politics, advocating for diverse and inclusive education while serving his constituents in the state assembly.
