Luanne M. Peterpaul is an American politician, lawyer, and former judge serving as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly for the 11th legislative district since taking office on January 9, 2024.

Early in her career, Peterpaul served as a board chair of **Garden State Equality** for 12 years. During her tenure, she played a crucial role in establishing **same-sex marriage** in New Jersey. In 2011, she co-authored the **New Jersey Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights**, which was subsequently signed into law by Governor Chris Christie.

Peterpaul's legal background includes serving as an **assistant county prosecutor** in Essex County and as a **conflict municipal judge** in Asbury Park. In 2018, she received a nomination from Mayor John Pallone to serve a three-year term as the municipal court judge of Long Branch.

In the **2023 New Jersey General Assembly election**, Peterpaul, along with running mate Vin Gopal in the New Jersey Senate, secured victory for the Democratic Party by defeating Republican incumbents Marilyn Piperno and Kimberly Eulner. This win marked a significant milestone as Peterpaul became the **first openly LGBTQ woman** to be elected to the New Jersey State Legislature.

The 11th legislative district, which Peterpaul represents, includes Monmouth County. Her commitment to public service and advocacy continues to shape her work in the New Jersey General Assembly, where she serves on committees related to commerce, economic development, agriculture, and aging and human services.
