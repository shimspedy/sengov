Jessica Ramirez is a partner with the firm and a trial attorney specializing in serious personal injury, sexual abuse, medical device, and product liability litigation. She earned her Juris Doctor from Seton Hall University School of Law and holds a Bachelor of Arts from Stockton University, majoring in Political Science with a minor in Latin American History.

## Early Life and Education

Jessica was born in Puerto Rico and moved to New Jersey when she was eight years old. Despite facing language barriers, she excelled in school. Her parents emphasized the importance of education, and through their support and her dedication, Jessica pursued her dream of a legal career. Prior to college, she had never even met a lawyer, but her favorite professors, who were lawyers, inspired her to follow their path.

## Legal Career and Community Service

Jessica's legal career has allowed her to serve her community and advocate for the underrepresented. As a contract attorney for the Public Defender’s Office of New Jersey, she represented indigent clients and juveniles. During her time as the managing attorney of the Immigration Program of Catholic Charities, she defended individuals’ rights to seek asylum and provided legal counsel to families who had been separated, fighting against related policies.

## Breaking Barriers

Being a Latina attorney in the U.S. is a rarity, and Jessica is proud to have achieved this milestone. Hispanics make up only about 4 percent of U.S. lawyers, and for Latina women, these numbers are even smaller. Jessica understands the importance of representation and strives to be a role model for others.

## Legislative Role

Jessica Ramirez currently serves as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly for the 32nd legislative district, having taken office on January 9, 2024. Her committees include Community Development and Women's Affairs, as well as Military and Veterans' Affairs.
