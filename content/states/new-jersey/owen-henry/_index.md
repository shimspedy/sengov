Owen Henry, born on May 30, 1959, is an American Republican Party politician who is currently serving as a member of the New Jersey Senate for the 12th legislative district. He assumed office on January 9, 2024.

Henry was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, and moved in 1961 to Old Bridge Township, New Jersey. He graduated from Cedar Ridge High School (since merged with Old Bridge High School) in 1977 and Trenton State College (since renamed as The College of New Jersey) in 1981. He is the owner of Owen Henry Contracting, Inc., an industrial building construction company.

Before his tenure in the Senate, Henry served on the board of education of the Old Bridge Township Public Schools from 2009 to 2011 and served as mayor of Old Bridge from 2012 to 2023. With Senator Samuel D. Thompson retiring from the Senate after having switched parties from Republican to Democratic, Senator Henry's election flipped District 12 back to the Republicans.

He defeated Democratic challenger Brandon Rose by a vote of 28,038 (62.2%) to 16,265 (36.1%) in the 2023 New Jersey Senate election, with independent candidate Nina Jochnowitz collecting 806 votes. Henry was one of 10 members elected for the first time in 2023 to serve in the Senate, one quarter of all seats.

Each of the 40 districts in the New Jersey Legislature has one representative in the New Jersey Senate and two members in the New Jersey General Assembly. The representatives from the 12th District for the 2024—2025 Legislative Session are: Senator Owen Henry (R), Assemblyman Robert D. Clifton (R), and Assemblyman Alex Sauickie (R).
