Sean T. Kean (born May 21, 1963) is an American Republican Party politician who has represented the 30th legislative district in the New Jersey General Assembly since being sworn into office on January 10, 2012. Prior to redistricting, Kean served in the New Jersey Senate from 2008 to 2012, representing the 11th legislative district.

Biography:
Kean was born in Montclair, grew up in Deal, and attended Red Bank Catholic High School. He is of Irish heritage and has family ancestry in County Cork. Kean received a B.A. in 1988 from Seton Hall University in Political Science, was granted an M.A.L.S. in 1992 from Columbia University in American Studies, and was awarded a J.D. from the Seton Hall University School of Law in 1995. Before becoming an attorney, Kean was a member of the Heavy and General Construction Laborers Local 472 Union (a branch of the Laborers' International Union of North America) in Newark from 1984 until 1988.

Kean served as an aide to State Senator John O. Bennett from 1994 through 1996. He also served on the Monmouth County Environmental Council from 1999 to 2001 and on the Wall Township Planning Board from 2001 to 2002. Interestingly, prior to 1994, Kean had been registered as a Democrat.

Kean currently resides in Wall Township with his wife Bridget and their triplets born in July 2012. He formerly wrote a column titled "Legislative Matters" in The Coast Star, a weekly local newspaper in Monmouth County. His column typically contains news from the statehouse in Trenton, opinions on issues facing his district, and criticism of the state's Democratic Party.

Legislative Career:
Kean first took his seat in the Assembly on October 28, 2002, following his selection by the District 11 Republican County Committee members to fill the vacancy created by the death of Assemblyman Thomas S. Smith. Despite not having the endorsement of Monmouth County Republican Chair William F. Dowd and the district's other Assemblyman Steve Corodemus, Kean won the special convention vote, winning a majority of the vote (113 votes) on the first ballot, defeating Long Branch councilman Anthony Giordano (81 votes) and former Asbury Park mayor Carl Williams.

Overall, Sean T. Kean has made significant contributions to New Jersey politics and continues to serve his constituents diligently.
