Parker Space, born on December 4, 1968, is an American Republican Party politician and owner of Space Farms Zoo and Museum. He has been representing the 24th Legislative District in the New Jersey Senate since January 2024. Before his election to the Senate, he represented the 24th District in the New Jersey General Assembly starting in March 2013.

Space graduated in 1987 from High Point Regional High School. He is a farmer and restaurant owner who also owns Space Farms Zoo and Museum in the Beemerville section of Wantage Township in Sussex County. He has served with the Wantage Fire Department as a volunteer firefighter since 1989 and was the department's chief from 2001 to 2002. He served on the Wantage Township Committee from 2004 to 2009, was elected as the township's mayor in 2005, 2008 and 2009, and served as deputy mayor in 2006 and 2007.

Space was appointed to the Sussex County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 2010 following the appointment of Hal Wirths to head the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Space won a full three-year term in the 2010 general election and was chosen as Freeholder Director in 2013.

Space served as freeholder until his appointment to the General Assembly filling a vacancy left by the resignation of Gary R. Chiusano in 2013. Chiusano was appointed to the vacant position of Sussex County Surrogate, and Space was chosen by a convention called of party delegates from municipalities to fill the vacancy per New Jersey state law. Space received 103 of the 158 delegate votes cast, defeating Bader Qarmout, John Wroblewski, and Mark Quick. He was elected to his own full term in November 2013, then again in 2015 and 2017.

Space had considered retiring from the Assembly after his term ended in 2024, but decided to run for the New Jersey Senate after Steve Oroho announced his retirement. He won the general election on November 7, 2023, and assumed office on January 9, 2024. His current term ends on January 11, 2028.

As of the 2020 Census, New Jersey state senators represented an average of 232,362 residents. After the 2010 Census, each member represented 220,188 residents. New Jersey State Senate District 24, which Space represents, is no exception.
