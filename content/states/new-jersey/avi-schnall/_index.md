Alexander "Avi" Schnall is an American Democratic Party politician who has represented the 30th legislative district in the New Jersey General Assembly since being sworn into office on January 9, 2024. Originally from Brooklyn, Schnall moved to Lakewood Township, New Jersey, to study at Beth Medrash Govoha.

Schnall's victory in the 2023 New Jersey General Assembly election was described as "a major upset" in a district that had traditionally been solidly Republican. His win reflects the growing Orthodox Jewish community in Lakewood Township and surrounding areas. Schnall's Democratic running mate, Salvatore "Sal" Frascino, came in a distant fourth.

Before entering politics, Avi Schnall earned a bachelor's degree from the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia and a master's degree from Beth Medrash Govoha. His career experience includes working as the national director of Chillzone at Oorah Inc and as the director of Agudath Israel of America's New Jersey office.

As a legislator, Schnall serves on the Education and State and Local Government committees for the 2024-2025 Legislative Session. He represents Monmouth and Ocean counties in the 30th Legislative District, which includes municipalities such as Avon-by-the-Sea, Belmar, Farmingdale, Howell, Lake Como, Lakewood, and Wall.
