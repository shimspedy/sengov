James William "Jim" Holzapfel was born on October 9, 1944. He is an American lawyer and a politician from the Republican Party. He has been serving in the New Jersey State Senate since January 10, 2012, representing the 10th legislative district. Before his election to the Senate, he had served in the New Jersey General Assembly since 2003.

Holzapfel was born in Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey, and is a graduate of Point Pleasant Beach High School. He received a B.A. from Monmouth College in Pre-Law and was awarded a J.D. degree from the Seton Hall University School of Law. He resides in Toms River, New Jersey. He is married to Joyce Holzapfel (née Holden) and they have two children, Dennis and Jennifer.

In his early career, Holzapfel served as a Trustee of Ocean County College from 1988 to 1994. He was the Ocean County Prosecutor from 1987 to 1992. Holzapfel has been admitted to practice law since 1969 before the New Jersey Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Florida Supreme Court.

Holzapfel's political career began with his appointment to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1994, following the resignation of Assemblywoman Virginia E. Haines. He was subsequently reelected in the 1994 special election and the regular biennial elections thereafter. He served as the Deputy Republican Leader from 2002 to 2003 and was the Assistant Majority Whip from 1998 to 2000.

In February 2011, Senator Andrew R. Ciesla announced that he would not run again for office after 20 years in the Senate and that he would support Holzapfel as his successor. In the November 2011 election, Holzapfel defeated Democrat Charles Tivenan by a 64%-36% margin.
