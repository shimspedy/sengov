Louis D. Greenwald (born March 11, 1967) is an American attorney and Democratic Party politician. He has represented the 6th Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly since taking office on January 9, 1996. Throughout his tenure, Greenwald has played a pivotal role in shaping New Jersey's legislative landscape.

As the Assembly Majority Leader since January 10, 2012, Greenwald has been a driving force behind key initiatives. Notably, he was the architect of the 2003 legislation that aimed to increase competition in New Jersey's auto insurance market. This legislation successfully addressed the state's auto insurance crisis, leading to a significant rise in the number of auto insurers operating in New Jersey.

Greenwald's commitment to public service extends beyond legislative matters. He has consistently advocated for policies that benefit New Jersey residents, particularly in areas such as property tax relief for seniors and working-class families. His leadership has been instrumental in advancing bills related to housing, homeownership programs, and tourism.

In addition to his legislative work, Greenwald has been actively involved in community service and civic organizations. His dedication to improving the lives of New Jerseyans has left a lasting impact on the state's political landscape.
