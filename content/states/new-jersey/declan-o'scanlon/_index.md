Declan Joseph O'Scanlon Jr. was born on June 9, 1963, in Marlboro Township, New Jersey. He is an American politician who has served in the New Jersey Senate since 2018, representing the 13th Legislative District. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 2012 to 2018. Prior to the 2011 redistricting, O'Scanlon represented the 12th Legislative District in the Assembly from 2008 to 2012.

O'Scanlon was born in Marlboro Township and resides in Little Silver. He served on the Little Silver Borough Council from 1994 to 2007 and also served as the borough's police commissioner. O'Scanlon graduated with dual bachelor's degrees from Monmouth University (a BA and a BS), majoring in Psychology and Finance. He is the chief executive officer of FSD Enterprises LLC of Red Bank. The company is a wireless telecommunications consulting and public relations firm he founded in 1995.

In the New Jersey Assembly, O'Scanlon lost a very close Assembly election held on November 8, 2005. As of December 6, 2005, Beck was declared winner of one of the seats, and was the top vote getter in the District with 31,421 votes. Freshman Democratic Assemblyman Michael J. Panter won re-election with 30,473 votes, narrowly edging O'Scanlon, who had 30,400 votes, just 73 fewer than Panter. One-term incumbent Robert Lewis Morgan lost his bid for re-election, coming in fourth with 30,257 votes.

In a partial rematch of 2005, O'Scanlon and his Republican running mate Caroline Casagrande defeated incumbent Panter and future Monmouth County Freeholder Amy Mallet in the 2007 General Assembly election. O'Scanlon and Casagrande received 25.6% and 25.5% of the vote respectively while Panter and Mallet got 25.0% and 23.9% respectively.

With integrity, experience, and a vision for a better future, he continues to be a staunch advocate for the residents of the 13th district, striving to create positive change and improve the lives of all those he serves.
