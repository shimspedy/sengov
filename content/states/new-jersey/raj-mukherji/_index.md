Raj Mukherji is a distinguished member of the New Jersey State Senate, representing the 32nd District. He assumed office on January 9, 2024, and his current term extends until January 11, 2028. Before his tenure in the Senate, Mukherji served in the New Jersey General Assembly, representing the 33rd District from 2014 to 2024.

Born on July 15, 1984, Mukherji has a diverse educational background. He earned his Bachelor of Arts from Thomas Edison State College, his Master of Liberal Arts with a focus on national security from the University of Pennsylvania, and his Juris Doctor from Seton Hall Law School.

Mukherji's professional journey is equally impressive. He has worked as an entrepreneur, co-founding a public affairs firm, and has served as the Deputy Mayor of Jersey City. His experience also extends to the legal field, where he has worked as a local prosecutor and law professor.

In addition to his political and professional roles, Mukherji has a commendable military background. He served in Military Intelligence for the United States Marine Corps Reserve from 2001 to 2009, enlisting just two weeks following the September 11th terrorist attacks.

Throughout his political career, Mukherji has been assigned to several committees. In the Senate, he serves as Vice Chairman of the Transportation Committee and is a member of the Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens, and Military and Veterans’ Affairs Committees. In the Assembly, he served as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and Telecommunications and Utilities Committee.

Mukherji's entrepreneurial spirit was evident from a young age, as he started multiple successful businesses before completing his teenage years. He was sworn into his first public office at age 24. At 28, Mukherji won a six-way Democratic primary election for the State Assembly by a 36-point margin in 2013 and won the November general election by a 20-point margin, becoming the second South Asian legislator in state history.

In 2016 and 2017, Mukherji was identified as the most prolific lawmaker in the state because of his primary sponsorship of more bills signed into law than any other legislator. The 32nd district, which Mukherji represents, includes the Hudson County municipalities of Jersey City and Hoboken.
