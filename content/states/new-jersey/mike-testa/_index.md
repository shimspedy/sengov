Michael L. Testa Jr., born on May 1, 1976, is an American politician and lawyer who represents the 1st Legislative District in the New Jersey Senate. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Testa was born in Vineland, New Jersey. He is the great-grandson of Italian immigrants on his father's side, and his mother is a Polish Jew whose parents had met each other in a concentration camp. Testa received a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Juris Doctor degree from Villanova University, and a Master of Laws degree from Temple University.

Testa is a partner at the law firm of Testa Heck Testa and White, P.A. He was elected as chairman of the Cumberland County Republican Party in 2014, after serving as vice chairman for three years. From 2006 to 2008, Testa was a member of the Vineland Downtown Improvement District/Main Street Vineland. He has also been a chairman of the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cumberland and Salem Counties, and board president of Vineland Regional Dance.

In October 2019, the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign named Testa, along with State Senate Minority Whip Joseph Pennacchio, as New Jersey co-chairs for the president's re-election bid.

On November 5, 2018, 1st District State Senator Jeff Van Drew won a seat to the United States House of Representatives, creating a vacancy for his state senate seat. On November 20, Testa announced he would run for the special election for the remainder of Van Drew's State Senate term. President Donald Trump recorded robocalls for Testa in his state senate election, which were sent out on the day before election day.

Testa ran as a team with Antwan McClellan and Erik K. Simonsen for Assembly. During the campaign, the team made immigration and taxes a key part of their campaign. He, alongside Testa and McClellan, ousted the 1st District's legislators, Senator Bob Andrzejczak (who had been appointed to fill Van Drew's seat) and Assemblymen R. Bruce Land and Matthew W. Milam. Their victories were the only gains Republicans made in the 2019 New Jersey elections.

Testa was sworn into the Senate on December 5, 2019, by Senate President Steve Sweeney. His current term ends on January 11, 2028.
