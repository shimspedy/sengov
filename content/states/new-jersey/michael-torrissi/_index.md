Michael Torrissi Jr. (born 1974) is an American Republican Party politician who has represented the 8th Legislative district in the New Jersey General Assembly since he took office on January 11, 2022. Torrissi graduated in 1993 from Hammonton High School. He is the owner of Torrissi Transport, a fuel trucking company based in Vineland with more than 400 trucks and locations across the east coast. Torrissi earned a bachelor's degree in history in 1996 from Rutgers University-Camden.

In February 2011, Torrissi was appointed to fill the vacant Hammonton Town Council seat that had been held by James Bertino until he resigned to take a seat on the Board of County Freeholders; he served until 2012. He also served on the Hammonton council from 2011 to 2012 and again from 2015 to 2020.

The 8th Legislative District in New Jersey includes one representative in the New Jersey Senate and two members in the New Jersey General Assembly. The representatives from the 8th District for the 2024-2025 Legislative Session are Senator Latham Tiver (R), Assemblyman Andrea Katz (D), and Assemblywoman Michael Torrissi (R).

In the 2023 general election, Torrissi secured his seat with 27,881 votes (25.3%), alongside Democratic candidate Andrea Katz. The 2021 general election also saw Torrissi as a Republican hold, with 40,467 votes (26.45%).

Torrissi's commitment to public service and his background in business contribute to his role as an assemblyman, where he continues to represent the interests of the 8th Legislative district in the New Jersey General Assembly.
