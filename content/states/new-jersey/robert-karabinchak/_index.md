Rob Karabinchak is a dedicated public servant, currently in his fifth term as the representative of New Jersey's 18th Legislative District. This district includes the Middlesex municipalities of East Brunswick, Edison, Highland Park, Metuchen, Milltown, South Plainfield, and South River.

Before joining the General Assembly, Karabinchak served the residents of Edison for 16 years. His commitment to public service began with eight years on the Zoning Board of Adjustments, followed by eight years on the Township Council as a Councilmember. He eventually became the Council President.

As a member of the Assembly, Karabinchak chairs the Assembly State and Local Government Committee. Additionally, he serves on the Assembly Commerce and Economic Development Committee and the Assembly Transportation and Independent Authorities Committee. From 2018 to 2019, he held the position of Deputy Majority Whip.

Karabinchaks top priorities include investing in clean energy and renewable resources, improving infrastructure, and advocating for tax reform. As a lifelong resident of Edison, he also contributes to the local business community as the President of Tri-form Construction in Metuchen.

Outside of politics, Karabinchak is a family man. He has been married to his wife, Linda, for 42 years, and they are proud parents of three adult children: Steven, Brian, and Lori.

In summary, Assemblyman Robert J. Karabinchak's dedication to his constituents and his focus on critical issues make him a valuable representative for New Jersey's 18th Legislative District.
