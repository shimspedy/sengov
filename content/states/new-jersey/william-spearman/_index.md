William W. Spearman (born February 27, 1958) is an American Democratic Party politician from Camden, who has represented the 5th Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly since taking office on June 30, 2018. Raised in Camden, New Jersey, Spearman graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School (since renamed as Eastside High School) and Rutgers University before attending Temple University, where he earned an M.B.A.

Before taking office in the Assembly in June 2018, Spearman had served on the Camden city council from 2006 to 2011 and had been employed for a decade with the South Jersey Transportation Authority, serving for five years as the agency's ethics liaison officer. He was chosen by the county Democratic Party committee on June 27, 2018 to succeed Arthur Barclay, who had resigned from office earlier that month after being arrested for assault.

In the Assembly, Spearman serves on several committees, including Law and Public Safety (Chair), Agriculture and Food Security (Vice-chair), Special Committee on Infrastructure and Natural Resources, and Transportation and Independent Authorities.

Spearman has been re-elected to the Assembly in subsequent elections, including the 2023 general election where he secured victory alongside fellow Democrat William F. Moen Jr.
