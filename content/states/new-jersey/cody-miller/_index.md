Biography:
A resident of Monroe Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey, Miller graduated from Gloucester County College (now known as Rowan College of South Jersey) and Rutgers University-Camden. He currently works as the director of foundation and alumni relations at Rowan College of South Jersey.

In January 2019, Miller was selected to fill the Monroe Township Council Ward 2 seat, which had been vacated by Richard DiLucia when he became the township's mayor. In the November 2019 general election, Miller was elected to serve the balance of the term of office. He also served on the board of education of the Monroe Township Public Schools.

During the 2023 New Jersey General Assembly election, Miller, along with his Democratic running mate Dan Hutchison, defeated Republicans Amanda Esposito and Matthew P. Walker. At the age of 32, Miller is the youngest member of the Assembly and the first New Jersey legislator born in the 1990s.

District 4:
The 4th legislative district in the New Jersey Legislature includes Atlantic, Camden, and Gloucester counties. Miller represents this district alongside Senator Paul D. Moriarty and Assemblyman Dan Hutchison.

Electoral History:
In the 2023 general election, Miller received 29,770 votes, securing his position as an Assemblyman.

Miller's dedication to public service and his commitment to education make him a valuable asset to the New Jersey General Assembly.
