Herbert C. Conaway Jr., born on January 30, 1963, is an American Democratic Party politician representing the 7th Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly. His political career spans several decades, and he has held various leadership positions within the Assembly.

**Early Life and Education:**
Conaway was born at St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton, New Jersey. His parents, Eva Christine Conaway (a nurse) and Herb Conaway Sr. (a history teacher), instilled a strong sense of community service in him. Growing up in Bordentown, he attended high school there before pursuing higher education.

He earned his A.B. in politics from Princeton University in 1985, where he completed a 67-page senior thesis titled "Black Political Strategy." Later, he obtained an M.D. degree from Jefferson Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University and a J.D. from Rutgers School of Law-Newark. Remarkably, Conaway is the only legislator to hold both an M.D. and a J.D. degree.

**Military Service and Medical Career:**
From 1992 to 1996, Conaway served in the United States Air Force Medical Corps, achieving the rank of Captain. His duties included serving at McGuire Air Force Base in Burlington County as a general medical officer and assistant director of the primary care clinic. Even while serving in the legislature, he continues to practice medicine, specializing in internal medicine. Currently, he serves as the director of the internal medicine clinic at St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton.

**Political Career:**
Conaway's political journey began when he was elected to the General Assembly from the 7th District in 1997 as the top vote-getter. His running mate, Jack Conners, also joined him, but due to voting machine issues, Conners was later replaced by Republican Kenneth William Faulkner. Conners was subsequently elected in a 1998 special election, and the two served together until 2011 when Conners resigned. Since late 2011, Conaway's Assembly associate from the district has been Troy Singleton.

Throughout his tenure, Conaway has held significant roles within the Assembly. He served as the Majority Whip from 2014 to 2017 and was the Deputy Speaker from 2002 to 2005. In 2022, he resumed his position as Deputy Speaker.

**Personal Life:**
Formerly a resident of Delanco Township, Conaway now resides in Moorestown. His commitment to public service, combined with his medical expertise, has made him a respected figure in New Jersey politics.
