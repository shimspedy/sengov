Christopher P. DePhillips (born March 30, 1965) is an American attorney and Republican Party politician who has represented the 40th Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly since 2018. He replaced David C. Russo, who decided against running for re-election after 28 years in office.

DePhillips graduated in 1983 from Bergen Catholic High School, earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in government from Georgetown University in 1987, and a juris doctor degree from Seton Hall University School of Law in 1992. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Washington, D.C., as an aide to Congresswoman Marge Roukema.

A practicing attorney, DePhillips is vice president and general counsel of Porzio Life Sciences. He served as mayor of Wyckoff and was unanimously chosen by his peers to serve as the township's mayor in 2012. Additionally, he served as a Commissioner of the Northwest Bergen County Utilities Authority from June 2012 until 2017, providing sewage treatment services to 75,000 residents in Bergen County.

In February 2019, DePhillips introduced a bill that would abolish the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, although it never came to a vote in Committee. In June 2021, he was appointed to GOP caucus leadership, being named deputy Republican leader by NJ Assembly Republican leader Jon Bramnick. Later that year, DePhillips introduced a bill to allow vote-by-mail ballots to be counted as they are received, aiming to address some of the issues that lead to conspiracy theories during elections.
