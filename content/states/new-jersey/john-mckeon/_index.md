John F. McKeon was born on June 3, 1958, in Montclair, New Jersey. He was raised in the Townships of Orange and West Orange, where he graduated from West Orange Mountain High School. In 1980, he graduated Cum Laude from Muhlenberg College and earned his Juris Doctorate from Seton Hall University School of Law in 1983.

McKeon served as a judicial clerk to Joseph M. Thuring, Superior Court of New Jersey in Hudson County, and as a legislative aide to Representative Joseph Minish. He is a former legislative counsel to Senator Richard Codey and counsel to the West Orange Board of Adjustment. He is a senior partner at Hardin, Kundla, McKeon, Poletto and Polifroni, a law firm in Springfield Township. He is married to Ann Mader McKeon, also an attorney at the same firm, and has three daughters.

McKeon had served on the Township of West Orange Council from 1992 to 1998 as the Mayor of West Orange from 1998 to 2010. From the time that he took office in the Assembly in 2002 until he left his position as mayor in June 2010, he simultaneously held a seat in the New Jersey General Assembly and was West Orange Mayor. This dual position, often called double dipping, was allowed under a grandfather clause in the state law enacted by the New Jersey Legislature and signed into law by Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine in September 2007 that prevents dual-office-holding but allows those who had held both positions as of February 1, 2008, to retain both posts.

John McKeon is a member of the New Jersey State Senate, representing District 27. He assumed office on January 9, 2024. His current term ends on January 11, 2028. McKeon ran for election to the New Jersey State Senate to represent District 27. He won in the general election on November 7, 2023.
