Cleopatra Gibson Tucker (born April 9, 1943) is an American Democratic Party politician who has represented the 28th Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly since 2008.

Biography:
Tucker was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama. She attended Tennessee State University, majoring in sociology. After moving to Newark, New Jersey, in 1966, she was hired by the Newark Housing Authority in 1976. She retired from the Authority in 2002. Currently, she serves as the executive director of a non-profit organization called The Centre, Inc. The Centre's headquarters was named after her late husband, Donald Kofi Tucker, in 2006.

Personal Life:
Tucker has two grown children with her late husband and is a resident of Newark's Weequahic neighborhood.

Political Career:
After Donald Tucker, who was both a Newark councilman and an Assemblyman, died in October 2005 and posthumously won re-election to his Assembly seat, Assemblyman Tucker was replaced in a special election convention by Evelyn Williams, who was elected to serve the remaining month of the term and the first year of the full term. Williams resigned from the Assembly in January 2006 before the start of the new session, following her arrest for shoplifting, creating a vacant seat. A special election convention appointed Democratic Party activist Oadline Truitt to the seat for the first half of the term, and she was re-elected in a November 2006 special election. In Truitt's first bid for a full two-year term, Tucker and Essex County Freeholder and former Assemblyman from the 1960s-1970s Ralph R. Caputo defeated Truitt and incumbent Assemblyman Craig A. Stanley in the June 2007 Democratic primary. Tucker has subsequently won re-election to the Assembly every two years since then.

In January 2011, Tucker introduced a bill that would require every bicycle in the state of New Jersey to display a license plate, which would be registered with the government for a small fee. Within about a week, she withdrew her proposal.

Committees:
- Military and Veterans' Affairs (as chair)
- Aging and Human Services (as vice-chair)
