Vincent Joseph Polistina, born on June 10, 1971, is an American Republican politician who has been serving in the New Jersey Senate since 2021. He previously served in the New Jersey General Assembly, where he represented the 2nd Legislative District from 2008 to 2012.

A lifelong resident of Atlantic County, Polistina grew up in Galloway Township and graduated from Absegami High School in 1989. He received a B.A. from Rutgers University with a major in Bioenvironmental Engineering. He is the owner of the engineering firm of Polistina and Associates, L.L.C. He lives in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, with his wife Carolyn and their three children.

After serving two terms in the New Jersey General Assembly, Polistina ran for the New Jersey Senate in the 2nd district in the 2011 election, losing to incumbent Democrat Jim Whelan in what was the state's most expensive race, with more than $3 million spent by both candidates. His Assembly seat was filled by Chris A. Brown. 

Shortly after Chris A. Brown resigned from office on July 19, 2021, to join the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, the Republican Party chose Polistina to fill the vacant Senate seat, but he was not sworn into the Senate until November 8, 2021. In the 2021 New Jersey Senate election, Polistina was elected to fill the full term of office beginning in January 2022, defeating Democratic state Assemblyman Vince Mazzeo.

Polistina is a member of the New Jersey State Senate, representing District 2. He assumed office on January 11, 2022. His current term ends on January 11, 2028. He won in the general election on November 7, 2023.

As of the 2020 Census, New Jersey state senators represented an average of 232,362 residents. After the 2010 Census, each member represented 220,188 residents. New Jersey State Senate District 2 is represented by Vincent Polistina (R).
