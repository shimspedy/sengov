Paul D. Moriarty was born on September 25, 1956. He is an American Democratic Party politician who has represented the 4th Legislative District in the New Jersey Senate since taking office on January 9, 2024. He served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 2006 to 2024 and was the Assembly's Deputy Speaker from 2018 to 2024.

Moriarty worked as an investigative journalist at KYW-TV for 17 years protecting consumer rights and investigating unscrupulous or unethical businesses. Before KYW, Moriarty was a news producer at WCAU -TV. Moriarty has earned over 30 Emmy Awards, honors from the National Press Association, the Associated Press and the Radio-Television News Directors Association. He was a member of American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) for 20 years while working as a journalist. He served six years as a shop steward.

Running on a platform of open government, property tax relief, and the elimination of waste and inefficiency, Moriarty was elected Mayor of Washington Township in November 2004. He garnered 60% of the vote in a hotly contested four-way race in which Republican voters were sharply divided. He was mayor of Washington Township for one term from 2005 until 2008. After forming a recall committee, on June 9, 2006, a Washington Township resident filed a petition to recall Moriarty from his post as mayor, with the goal of placing the initiative on the November 2006 general election ballot based on obtaining the requisite number of about 8,000 signatures needed for recall. The recall effort was ultimately unsuccessful.

Moriarty was elected to the Assembly on November 8, 2005, filling the seat of fellow Democrat Robert J. Smith II, who did not run for re-election and had held the seat in the Assembly since 2000. On June 1, 2006, Assemblyman Moriarty, along with State Senator Stephen M. Sweeney (D, 3rd legislative district) and fellow Assembly Democrat Jerry Green (D, 22nd legislative district ), held a press conference to announce their support for significant cuts to New Jersey state worker salaries and benefits of up to 15%.

Paul Moriarty (Democratic Party) is a member of the New Jersey State Senate, representing District 4. He assumed office on January 9, 2024. His current term ends on January 11, 2028. Moriarty (Democratic Party) ran for election to the New Jersey State Senate to represent District 4. He won in the general election on November 7, 2023.
