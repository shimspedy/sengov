Senator Andrew Zwicker is the first Democrat ever elected to the 16th Legislative District, serving in the General Assembly for three terms (2016 – 2022) and now is the first Democratic Senator representing the district (2022 – Present).  A physicist and educator, Zwicker serves on the Budget and Appropriations, Higher Education, Labor, and Military and Veterans Affairs Committees and is a bipartisan member of both the Disability and Manufacturing Caucuses.  While in the General Assembly, he helped create and served as Chair of the Science, Innovation, and Technology Committee, was Vice-Chair of the Biotechnology Task Force, and was a member of the NJ Commission on Science Innovation and Technology.

His legislative focus is on ways to invest in innovation to create high-quality jobs for people of all backgrounds, addressing the climate crisis, and restoring trust in democracy through structural, election-related reforms.  Andrew Zwicker brings a fresh outlook to everyday problems. With his background in science and higher education he brings a fact-based pragmatism to the legislature.

A lifelong New Jersey resident, Andrew is Head of Strategic Partnerships and Public Engagement at Princeton University’s Plasma Physics Laboratory, a world leader in developing an advanced form of energy known as fusion. He has taught classes in bioethics and writing and led plasma physics workshops for college faculty, undergraduate students, and advanced high school students. The American Association of Physics Teachers named him as one of the 75 leading contributors to physics education in the US.  

Raised in Englewood, NJ, his love of learning and passion for science came from his mother, a public school English teacher, and father, a chemical engineer. Andrew earned a bachelor’s degree in physics from Bard College and a master’s and Ph.D. in physics from Johns Hopkins University. Andrew resides in the Kingston area of South Brunswick Township with his wife, Barbara, an educator in Hillsborough Township, along with their family. He enjoys surfing and playing soccer in his spare time.
