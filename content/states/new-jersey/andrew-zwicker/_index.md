Andrew P. Zwicker, born on May 17, 1964, is an American physicist and politician who has served in the New Jersey Senate from the 16th Legislative District since 2022. He previously served in the New Jersey General Assembly representing the 16th District from 2016 to 2022.

Zwicker was born in New York City and raised in Englewood, New Jersey. He graduated from Dwight Morrow High School in 1982. He achieved his B.A. in physics from Bard College in 1986, and his M.A. and Ph.D., both also in physics, from Johns Hopkins University in 1992. His dissertation was entitled "Soft X-Ray Spectroscopy of Magnetically Confined Fusion Plasmas Using Flat Multilayer Mirrors".

Zwicker's post-doctoral work focused on fusion energy research at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and internationally. He has been the head of the Science Education Department of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory since 2003, where his work is focused on creating innovative opportunities for students of all backgrounds to engage in scientific inquiry and his research is centered on plasmas as an educational tool and new methods of science communication.

At Princeton University, Zwicker was previously a part-time lecturer in the Writing Program and a faculty advisor for freshmen and sophomores in Rockefeller College. Zwicker has served on several national committees on education, is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and The American Association of Physics Teachers has named him to its list of 75 leading contributors to physics education.

Zwicker resides in Princeton, New Jersey with his wife, Barbara Golden, a New Jersey public school educator, along with their family, and their rescue pitbull-boxer mix, Rocky. He is an atheist.

Zwicker was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in New Jersey's 12th congressional district in 2014. He is a member of the Democratic Party as well as the head of the Science Education Department of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. He has been described as a protégé of former Representative Rush Holt Jr.

As of the 2020 Census, New Jersey state senators represented an average of 232,362 residents. After the 2010 Census, each member represented 220,188 residents. Members of the New Jersey State Senate serve four-year terms and are not subject to term limits. Known as the "2-4-4" cycle, Senators serve four-year terms, except in the first term of a new decade, which only lasts for two years. New Jersey legislators assume office at noon of the second Tuesday in January following the election.
