Antwan McClellan is a lifelong resident of Ocean City, New Jersey. He is the youngest of six siblings and attended Ocean City High School, as well as Virginia State University and Old Dominion University. McClellan currently serves as the Confidential Assistant/Personnel Director/Public Information Officer in the Cape May County Sheriff's Department.

His political journey began when he was first elected to the Ocean City Council in 2012, a position he held until 2020. During his time on the council, he also served as a member of the board of education for the Ocean City School District and volunteered for the South Jersey Field of Dreams. McClellan's commitment to public service extended beyond local government, as he was also a trustee on the Ocean City Historical Museum.

In early 2019, McClellan embarked on his bid for the New Jersey Assembly. Running alongside Mike Testa and Erik Simonsen, he successfully ousted incumbents Bruce Land and Matt Milam. Notably, McClellan became the first African American Republican in the legislature since 2002. His campaign faced controversy when a mailer from the Democratic-supporting General Majority PAC darkened his face, prompting accusations of racism. McClellan responded, stating, "The Democratic Party claims to be the party of inclusion. However, the moment a person of color like me disagrees with their narrative, they launch an ad hominem attack, whip out their best 'Aunt Jemima' photograph, and purposefully darken my complexion in order to suppress dissent."

As of January 14, 2020, McClellan has been serving in the New Jersey General Assembly. His committee assignments include Appropriations, Homeland Security and State Preparedness, Tourism, and Gaming and the Arts. Representing the 1st Legislative District, which encompasses parts of Atlantic County, Cumberland County, and all of Cape May County, McClellan continues to make history as a dedicated public servant.
