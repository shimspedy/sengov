William F. Moen Jr. is an American Democratic Party politician from Camden, New Jersey. He has been serving as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly since January 14, 2020, representing the 5th Legislative District. At the time of taking office, he was the state's youngest legislator in the Assembly.

Before joining the Assembly, Moen served on the Camden County Board of Chosen Freeholders from 2016 to 2019. During his tenure, he became one of the youngest individuals elected to serve as a freeholder. In March 2019, Moen resigned from his position as freeholder to focus on his run for the Assembly. Melinda Kane replaced him as freeholder.

Raised in Runnemede, Moen has been a resident of Camden. His commitment to public service and community engagement has been evident throughout his career. As a legislator, he has actively contributed to shaping policies related to tourism, gaming, housing, and financial institutions. Currently, he serves as the Chair of the Tourism, Gaming, and The Arts Committee and as Vice-Chair of the Housing Committee.

Moen's electoral history reflects his popularity and support among voters. In the 2023 general election, he secured re-election with a significant number of votes, alongside fellow Democrat William W. Spearman. Together, they continue to represent the 5th District in the New Jersey Legislature. Moen's dedication to public service and his commitment to addressing the needs of his constituents make him a valuable asset in New Jersey politics.
