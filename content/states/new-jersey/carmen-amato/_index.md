Carmen F. Amato Jr. is an American Republican Party politician serving as a member of the New Jersey Senate for the 9th legislative district. He assumed office on January 9, 2024. His current term ends on January 11, 2028.

A resident of the Bayville section of Berkeley Township, New Jersey, Amato attended Central Regional High School and Ocean County College. His career as an elected official began in 1993 when he was elected to a seat on the Berkeley Township Board of Education. Seven years later, in 2000, he was elected to the Central Regional Board of Education.

After being elected to the Berkeley Township Council in 2005 to represent Ward 2, Senator Amato was elected Mayor of Berkeley Township in 2011 and won reelection in 2015 and 2019. During his tenure as Mayor, Senator Amato prioritized keeping Berkeley Township's property taxes stable, making it the second lowest overall in Ocean County.

Following the catastrophic devastation caused by Superstorm Sandy, he worked to rebuild the Township's maritime area while also improving parks, playgrounds, and recreation areas. Working with federal, state, and county partners, the Mayor led efforts to preserve thousands of acres of open space in the Township. He prioritized updating and modernizing the Township's infrastructure while also continuing to invest in public safety by implementing policies that support police, fire, and first aid squad personnel serving as first responders.

In being responsive and transparent to constituents, the Mayor also prioritized improving the quality of life for veterans as well as senior community residents who have unique needs and, respectively, comprise large segments of the Township's population.

As an active member of his community, Senator Amato belongs to a multitude of civic organizations both past and present. He is a member of the New Jersey Conference of Mayors, National School Boards Association, New Jersey School Boards Association, New Jersey Association of Election Officials, New Jersey League of Municipalities, Ocean County School Boards Association, Ocean County Exploited and Missing Children's Advisory Commission, Central Ocean County Regional Italian American Club, and many others.

Amato ran for election to the New Jersey State Senate to represent District 9 and won in the general election on November 7, 2023. He defeated Gabriel Franco in the general election for New Jersey State Senate District 9.
