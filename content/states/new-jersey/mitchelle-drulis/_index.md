Mitchelle Drulis is an American Democratic Party politician serving as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly for the 16th legislative district. She took office on January 9, 2024. Drulis has been a resident of Raritan Township, New Jersey, and attended Rutgers University.

Her political career began as a legislative aide for then-Assemblyman (now State Senator) Bob Smith. She later served as Chief of Staff to Assemblyman Joe Egan for over a decade. In 2018, Drulis worked as the Political Director for Tom Malinowski's congressional campaign. Subsequently, she became Malinowski's district director, managing a constituent services program that assisted approximately 12,000 individual constituents across the district.

In the 2023 New Jersey General Assembly election, Drulis and her incumbent running mate, Roy Freiman, defeated Republicans Ross Traphagen and Grace Zang. Notably, her election marked the first time a Democrat from Hunterdon County had been elected to the State Legislature in over 40 years.

The 16th Legislative District, which Drulis represents, includes Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, and Somerset counties. As an Assemblywoman, she serves on committees related to labor, public safety and preparedness, and state and local government.

Drulis's commitment to public service, her experience working on bills, and her dedication to her constituents make her a valuable asset in New Jersey politics. Her historic election reflects her dedication to representing the people of her district and advocating for their needs and concerns.
