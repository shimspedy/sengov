Growing up in the city's historic East Ward, she attended the Academy of St. Benedict for grammar school and later graduated from Mother Seton Regional High School. Her educational journey continued at St. John's University in New York, where she earned both her bachelor's and master's degrees in legal studies and government/politics.

Before entering politics, Pintor Marin worked in the private sector for an investment banking firm. Her commitment to public service led her to become the Division Manager of Passports and Vault Recording in the office of the Essex County Clerk. Additionally, she served on the Advisory Board to the Newark Public Schools.

As a first-generation Portuguese American, Pintor Marin is deeply connected to her heritage. She is actively involved in the Newark Portuguese Sports Club and serves as the Director of the Portuguese School. Her dedication to education extends to her own family, as she is the first in her family to graduate from college.

In 2013, Pintor Marin stepped into the political arena when she was chosen to fill the vacant seat of Alberto Coutinho in the New Jersey General Assembly. Since then, she has been a tireless advocate for her constituents. Notably, she has served as the Assembly Budget Chair since 2018, overseeing critical financial decisions for the state.

Pintor Marin's legislative work extends beyond budget matters. She is Vice Chair of the Commerce and Economic Development Committee and also serves on the Budget Committee and Telecommunications and Utilities Committee.

Outside of her professional responsibilities, Pintor Marin resides in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark with her husband, Anthony, and their daughters, Amelia and Aveline.
