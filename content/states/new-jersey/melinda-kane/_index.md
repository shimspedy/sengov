Melinda Kane is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the New Jersey General Assembly. She represents the 6th Legislative District, having assumed office on January 23, 2025. Her current term is set to end in January 2027.

Assemblywoman Kane's journey into public service is deeply rooted in her personal experiences and commitment to community advocacy. A proud Gold Star Mother, she was profoundly impacted by the loss of her son, Marine Lance Corporal Jeremy Kane, who was tragically killed in Afghanistan. This personal tragedy inspired her to dedicate her life to supporting military families, veterans, and those in need. Her advocacy is driven by a profound sense of gratitude for the community's support during her family's darkest times, and she remains committed to giving back with compassion and determination.

Before joining the General Assembly, Kane served as a Camden County Commissioner for six years and spent eight years as a council member in Cherry Hill. Her extensive background in education, social work, and small business ownership has equipped her with a diverse skill set to address the needs of her constituents. A long-time resident of Camden County, she has lived in the area for over 40 years, fostering deep connections with the community she serves.

In her role as an Assemblymember, Kane focuses on issues that matter most to her district, including access to quality education, support for veterans and military families, and strengthening local economies. She serves on several key committees, including Appropriations, Health, and Military and Veterans' Affairs, where she works tirelessly to create a brighter and more prosperous future for all New Jerseyans.

Assemblywoman Kane's dedication to public service and her unwavering commitment to her community make her a respected and influential figure in New Jersey politics. Her leadership continues to inspire those around her, as she strives to make a meaningful difference in the lives of her constituents.
