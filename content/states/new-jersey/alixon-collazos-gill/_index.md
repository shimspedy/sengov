Alixon Collazos-Gill is an American Democratic Party politician serving as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly for the 27th legislative district. She assumed office on January 9, 2024. Here's a more detailed biography:

Alixon Collazos-Gill was born in Colombia and later emigrated to the United States, settling with her family in New Jersey. She graduated from Long Branch High School and then attended Rutgers University–Newark. Her educational background and experience have shaped her career in politics and public service.

Before entering politics, Collazos-Gill worked for New Jersey Network and served in the office of Congressman Steve Rothman. She also contributed to Phil Murphy's successful campaign for governor. Her dedication to public service led her to establish a government affairs firm, where she focuses on cannabis-related issues.

In the 2023 New Jersey General Assembly election, Collazos-Gill ran as a Democratic candidate alongside Rosy Bagolie. They defeated Republicans Irene DeVita and Michael G. Mecca Jr. to secure their seats. Collazos-Gill was one of 27 members elected for the first time in 2023 to serve in the General Assembly.

Committee assignments for the 2024—2025 Legislative Session include Children, Families and Food Security, Environment, Natural Resources, and Solid Waste, and Regulated Professions. As a representative of the 27th District, she works alongside Senator John F. McKeon and Assemblyman Rosy Bagolie.

Collazos-Gill's commitment to public service, her background in media and politics, and her focus on cannabis-related issues make her a valuable asset in the New Jersey General Assembly. She continues to advocate for her constituents and work towards positive change in her community.
