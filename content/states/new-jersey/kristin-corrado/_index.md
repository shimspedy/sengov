Kristin M. Corrado (born June 24, 1965) is an American Republican Party politician who has represented the 40th Legislative District in the New Jersey Senate since she was sworn into office on October 5, 2017. Before her appointment to the senate, she served as Passaic County Clerk for seven years.

**Personal and Early Life:**
A lifelong resident of the Borough of Totowa, New Jersey, Corrado attended St. James School before moving on to Paul VI High School. She continued her education at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania and graduated from Seton Hall University School of Law. As an attorney with over 30 years of experience, Corrado is admitted to practice law in both New Jersey and Florida. She is also a member of the Passaic County Bar Association.

**Career Highlights:**
- **Passaic County Clerk:** Corrado was first elected as Passaic County Clerk in 2009 and was re-elected for a second five-year term in 2014.
- **New Jersey Senate:** Corrado was appointed to fill the seat left by former Senator Kevin J. O'Toole, who resigned from office on July 1, 2017, to become a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. In the Senate, she has been actively involved in various committees, including Education, Economic Growth, and Judiciary.
- **Advocacy and Legislation:** Corrado led a fight to block Governor Phil Murphy's nomination of Assemblywoman Elizabeth Maher Muoio to be Secretary of Treasury, questioning Muoio's lack of experience in issues related to her proposed position. She also sponsored a bill alongside other senators to address vacancies in County Sheriff, Clerk, or Surrogate posts.

**Electoral History:**
In the 2023 General Election, Corrado secured her position as the Senator for the 40th Legislative District.
