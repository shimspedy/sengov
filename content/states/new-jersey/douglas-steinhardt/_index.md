Douglas Joseph Steinhardt, born on November 6, 1968, is an American attorney and politician from New Jersey. He represents the 23rd legislative district in the New Jersey Senate, having assumed office on December 19, 2022. He previously served as the Chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee from 2017 to 2020.

Steinhardt was born in Belvidere, New Jersey, and received his undergraduate degree in history from Gettysburg College in 1991. He was also a four-year member of the Gettysburg NCAA Division III football team. After completing his undergraduate studies, he enrolled in Widener University Commonwealth Law School where he earned his J.D. in 1994. During law school, he served as the associate editor of the Law Review.

After law school, Steinhardt returned to New Jersey to begin his law career in his father's law office in Belvidere, New Jersey. In 2005, he helped form the Law Firm of Florio Perrucci Steinhardt & Fader, LLC, by becoming the third named partner in the law firm that is headed by former New Jersey Governor James Florio. In 2015, Steinhardt was inducted into the Warren County, New Jersey Hall of Fame, joining his mother Therese, a nurse and nurse educator, who was inducted in 2013.

In his first run for public office, Steinhardt was elected Mayor of Lopatcong Township in 1999, beating Democratic incumbent William Baker by twelve votes. He ran on controlling development, and challenged Baker to debates, which Baker declined to participate in. In his reelection campaign in 2002, he again defeated Baker, this time with 80% of the vote. He ran and won with no opposition for the next three elections. He declined to run for a sixth term in 2014 and was succeeded by Tom McKay.

Steinhardt was elected chairman of the Warren County Republican Committee on January 31, 2004, to fill the unexpired term of the outgoing chair who resigned to focus on private sector opportunities. He is a conservative New Jersey Republican. He is pro-life, a Lifetime Member of the National Rifle Association, and a strong advocate for family and parental rights.

Steinhardt's New Jersey roots run deep. He grew up on the same Warren County farm where his parents still live. He married his wife, Trudy, in 1996, and they are the proud parents of Tia and Douglas Jr. Tia is a graduate of Moravian College and Villanova and the Vice President of Development for a national advertising and communications company. Douglas Jr. honed his skeet, trap, and sporting clay skills on the Steinhardt family farm and is a sophomore at Jacksonville University, where he earned a shooting scholarship and is a member of JU's varsity shooting team.

Steinhardt is a long-time, dedicated volunteer in his community. He is the founder and co-chairman of the Warren County Addiction Awareness Task Force. He also helped found and co-chairs the County Mental Health Task Force, which works to end the stigma associated with mental illness and helps connect County residents to needed services. He has served as general counsel to Law Enforcement Against Drugs (L.E.A.D.), on the campaign committee for Abilities of Northwest Jersey, the Board of Overseers of Widener Commonwealth Law School, and is a Certified, Red Cross Volunteer.
