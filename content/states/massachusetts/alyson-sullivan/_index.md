Alyson Sullivan-Almeida, born on February 7, 1988, is a Republican member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. She is a resident of Abington, Massachusetts and represents the 7th Plymouth district.

Sullivan-Almeida assumed office on January 2, 2019, succeeding Geoff Diehl. She was elected after Representative Geoff Diehl decided to run against Elizabeth Warren in the 2018 U.S. Senate Election.

She is also the daughter of former State Representative and ATF Director Michael Sullivan. Sullivan-Almeida is married to George Almeida since 2022.

She has a Bachelor of Science degree from Suffolk University and a Juris Doctor degree from New England Law Boston.

In her political career, she has been involved in various legislative activities. Some of her notable works include a petition for establishing a pilot program for veterans to use medical marijuana to treat medical conditions that are currently being treated with opioid-based medicine and combat opioid use disorder, a petition for establishing a special commission to study and determine best practices to ensure the safety of blind persons, and a petition relative to prohibiting price gouging of goods, services, and supplies during a declared public health emergency.
