Ken Sweezey was born and raised in Hanson, where he attended Maquan, Indian Head, and Hanson Middle Schools while participating in local little league and youth football. After attending Hanson Public Schools, he graduated from Boston College High School. Throughout high school, he worked at his family's small business in Whitman, where digging fence holes provided valuable insight into the dedication of the South Shore’s hardworking community members and the challenges of running a small business. These experiences shaped his strong advocacy for small businesses and his critical stance on government interference in their operations.

​

Following high school, he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Forensic Science from Loyola University Chicago. His work in forensic science led him to a career with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, where he served as a Latent Fingerprint Examiner for four years. During his time in St. Louis, he gained firsthand knowledge of the immense challenges law enforcement officers face daily. Supporting their mission and contributing to the public safety of the city was one of the greatest honors of his life.

​

Currently, he works as a project specialist at a small biotech company. As a private citizen, he served for over two years on the Economic Development Committee and the Capital Improvement Committee for the Town of Hanson.

​

He ran for State Representative to bring accountability to Beacon Hill and to stop out-of-touch politicians from raising taxes, wasting taxpayer dollars, and harming small businesses. He is committed to fighting for workers, business owners, first responders, families, and every individual in the 6th District. As State Representative, he is a strong advocate on Beacon Hill, working to ensure that life in the 6th Plymouth District is as prosperous and vibrant as its residents know it can be.
