Dylan Fernandes is an American politician currently serving as a member of the Massachusetts Senate from the Plymouth and Barnstable district. Born in 1989, Fernandes is a fourth-generation resident of Falmouth, Massachusetts, and grew up in Woods Hole. His paternal great-grandparents immigrated to Massachusetts from the Azores and Puerto Rico, making him of Portuguese and Puerto Rican descent. His mother, Tessa Lineaweaver, owns Flying Pig Pottery, and his father, Mario Fernandes, owns a small landscaping company.

Fernandes initially attended American University in Washington, D.C., before transferring to the College of Charleston, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in economics and political science. In 2022, he earned a Master of Public Administration from the Harvard Kennedy School.

Fernandes began his political career working on Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign in 2012. He later served as the political director for Maura Healey's campaign for Attorney General of Massachusetts in 2014. After the election, he worked in the Massachusetts Attorney General's office in the Civil Rights Division, focusing on cases combating discrimination. He also served as the digital director for the office, where he founded pro-LGBT rights events and women's rights initiatives, including the 'Everyone Welcome' campaign to support the bill for transgender rights.

In 2016, Fernandes ran for the Massachusetts House of Representatives, representing precincts in Barnstable, Dukes, and Nantucket counties. He won the election and served in the House from 2017 to 2025. During his tenure, he focused on environmental protection, affordable housing, economic development, and addressing the opioid epidemic and mental health issues. Fernandes was the second-youngest legislator in the Massachusetts House during his inaugural session.

Fernandes has been a strong advocate for clean air and water, holding companies accountable for environmental and public health negligence. His first legislation in the House was a bill signing Massachusetts onto the Paris Climate Agreement. Over his career, he has passed over 30 bills and secured tens of millions of dollars in funding for his district.

In 2024, Fernandes ran for the Massachusetts Senate and won the general election. He assumed office on January 1, 2025, succeeding Susan Moran. As a state senator, Fernandes continues to focus on protecting the environment, advancing affordable housing, supporting economic development, and addressing the opioid epidemic and mental health issues. He remains dedicated to serving his constituents and making a positive impact on the lives of the people in his district.
