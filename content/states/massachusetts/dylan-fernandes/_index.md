Dylan A. Fernandes is a State Representative currently serving in the Massachusetts House representing Martha’s Vineyard, the Elizabeth Islands, four precincts of Falmouth, and Nantucket. He has been serving since 2017 and is a member of the Democratic Party.

Born in Falmouth, Massachusetts, Fernandes is a fourth-generation resident of Falmouth, Massachusetts, and grew up in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. He is the son of Tessa Lineaweaver of Woods Hole who owns Flying Pig Pottery and of Mario Fernandes of Falmouth who owns a small landscaping company. Fernandes’s paternal great grandparents came to Massachusetts from the Azores and Puerto Rico. He is of Portuguese and Puerto Rican descent.

Fernandes first attended school at American University in Washington, D.C. He transferred to the College of Charleston and graduated there, earning a Bachelor of Science degree and majors in economics and political science. In 2022, he graduated with a Masters in Public Administration from the Harvard Kennedy School.

In 2012, Fernandes worked on Senator Elizabeths Warren’s campaign in his native Cape Cod region. Fernandes served as political director for Maura Healey, Attorney General of Massachusetts in 2014. He then went on to work as digital director in the Attorneys’ General office. His work there included founding pro-LGBT rights events and women’s rights. He also founded the ‘Everyone Welcome’ campaign to support the bill for transgender rights.

In 2017, Fernandes made his maiden speech on combatting climate change and compelled the House of Representatives to vote for his bill signing Massachusetts onto the Paris Climate Agreement. The bill passed 146-10.

In 2016, Fernandes ran for the Massachusetts House representing precincts 1, 2, 5 and 6, of Falmouth, in Barnstable County; Chilmark, Edgartown, Aquinnah, Gosnold, Oak Bluffs, Tisbury and West Tisbury, all in Dukes County; Nantucket, Nantucket County.
