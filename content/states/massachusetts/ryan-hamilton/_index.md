Ryan Hamilton is a member of the Democratic Party and represents the 15th Essex District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 4, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Hamilton grew up in a working-class family in the City of Methuen. His mother is a public school teacher, and his father is a retired union truck driver. He attended Methuen Public Schools before earning his bachelor’s degree in political science and government from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell in 2021.

In his professional life, Hamilton has dedicated his career to public service. He has worked as an executive assistant with the City of Methuen, a staff assistant with the congressional office of Lori Trahan, and a regional campaign coordinator with Lori Trahan’s 2018 congressional campaign.

As a legislator, Hamilton has sponsored several bills, including legislation to establish a sick leave bank for a Department of Unemployment Assistance employee, enhance hospital care for those with autism and intellectual and developmental disabilities, establish comprehensive school counseling programs, promote housing cooperatives, and expand property tax exemptions for veterans.

Hamilton’s district, the 15th Essex, consists of certain precincts in the cities of Haverhill and Methuen, both located in Essex County.
