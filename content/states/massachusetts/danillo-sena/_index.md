Danillo A. Sena, known as Dan, is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He represents the 37th Middlesex District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

Born on September 7, 1986, in Timbaúba, Brazil, Danillo is the first Brazilian immigrant to be elected to a state legislature in America. He moved to the United States when he was 14 years old and attended Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. He later attended Middlesex Community College and received a degree in Political Science from UMass Amherst.

Before his election, Danillo served as Senator Jamie Eldridge’s District Director for 6 years, working to protect immigrant rights, ensure healthcare access, and make progress towards racial justice and climate justice. He was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in a special election on June 2, 2020, against Republican Cathy Clark. The election was held to replace former Representative Jen Benson, who resigned back in January 2020 to become the new President of the Alliance for Business Leadership.

Danillo is a member of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus. He resides in Acton, Massachusetts with his spouse Danith "Melinda" Yim and their children Juliana and Leonardo.
