Russell Earl Holmes is an American politician who serves as a Democratic member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He was first elected in November 2010 and represents the Sixth Suffolk District, which includes the Boston neighborhoods of Dorchester, Hyde Park, Jamaica Plain, Mattapan, and Roslindale.

Holmes was born on August 17, 1969, in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. He is married to Sheree Holmes and resides in Mattapan, Massachusetts. He completed his education at Hyde Park High School, Boston University (Bachelor's degree, 1992), and Northeastern University (Graduate, 2000).

In his political career, Holmes has served as chair of the Mattapan Library Task Force and the Mattapan Economic Development Initiative. He has been assigned to various committees including the House Global Warming and Climate Change Committee, Operations, Facilities and Security Committee, House Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures, and State Assets, and Ways and Means Joint Committee.

In early 2023, Holmes cosponsored a bill to allow Massachusetts prisoners to earn time off from their sentences by immediately forfeiting some of their vital organs and/or bone marrow to the state. His current term ends on January 1, 2025.
