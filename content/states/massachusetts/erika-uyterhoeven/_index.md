Erika Uyterhoeven is a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives for the 27th Middlesex district. She is a member of the Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Prior to serving in elected office, Uyterhoeven was a political activist and antitrust economist.

Uyterhoeven was born on July 26, 1986, to a single mother born in Japan. Her mother was a union flight attendant, and Uyterhoeven has cited the rise of neoliberalism and the decline of the labor movement beginning in the 1980s as formative for her political development.

She attended Wayland High School in Wayland, Massachusetts, graduating in 2004. She received her bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in 2010, and received a master’s degree from the University of Toulouse in 2014. In 2019, Uyterhoeven graduated with a master’s in business administration (MBA) from Harvard Business School.

In 2020, Uyterhoeven ran to replace retiring incumbent Denise Provost as the member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives 27th Middlesex district. Running as a self-described democratic socialist, Uyterhoeven's successful campaign emphasized support for increased government transparency. She previously organized with Momentum, a socialist organization in the United Kingdom.
