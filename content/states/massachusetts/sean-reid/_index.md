Growing up in West Lynn, Sean faced a number of challenges, including housing insecurity that led his family to live in a homeless shelter, and witnessing his parents’ struggles with substance use. Sean credits his ability to overcome these hurdles to the strength and support of his community, which inspired him to dedicate his life to giving back. 

Sean graduated from Callahan Elementary School, Breed Middle School, and Lynn Classical High School before earning degrees from North Shore Community College and Amherst College (BA in economics). While in college, he interned with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s Community Development department, the Governor’s Office, and served as a substitute teacher in Lynn Public Schools.

Since graduating, Sean has gained experience across a variety of fields, holding positions with Lynn Public Schools, in real estate, at prominent law firms like Mintz, at the State House, and on community campaigns. He has also taken on leadership and service roles in the community, including serving as a member of the Lynn Rotary Club, a trustee for Alumni and Friends of Lynn Classical, a board member of the YMCA of Metro North, and a board member of My Brother’s Table. Additionally, Sean co-founded the nonprofit Kayak and Sail Lynn alongside his former high school teacher.

 

Sean began his career in government as an aide to State Senator Brendan Crighton, eventually serving as the Senator’s Legislative Director. His deep appreciation for public service and education led him to run successfully for the Lynn School Committee and later for his current role as State Representative.

 

Sean lives in West Lynn with his wife, Kelsey—a Lynn native, St. Mary’s High School graduate, and special education teacher in Lynn Public Schools—and their son, Jack.
