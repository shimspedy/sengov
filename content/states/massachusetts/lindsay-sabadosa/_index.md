Lindsay Sabadosa is an American activist and politician, and a member of the Democratic Party. She is the first woman to hold the 1st Hampshire district seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

Born and raised in the United States, Sabadosa completed her AB from Wellesley College and her MSc from the University of Edinburgh. She was the recipient of the Wellesley-Yenching Program Fellowship, which led her to spend a year in Nanjing, China as a fellow at Ginling College at Nanjing University.

After her studies, she moved to Italy where she worked in Marketing & Communications at CUP2000, a company in Bologna that strives to improve access and delivery of health care and provide telemedicine solutions throughout the European Union. During this time, she also opened her own small business, a translation firm, specializing in Italian and French legal and financial translation with a focus on international litigation, contract law, and finance.

Sabadosaâ€™s political journey began at a young age when she organized her first protest march at the age of nine to protest the closing of her hometown library due to budget cuts. She quickly became involved in political campaigns starting in high school, volunteering on campaigns for former Congressman John Olver, former Senator John Kerry, and several local officials. She soon began to focus her electoral work on women candidates, working for both local and state-wide women candidates, and ultimately joining the Board of Directors of Emerge Massachusetts in order to deepen and expand her interest in building benches.

She is a long-standing volunteer with the Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund of Massachusetts and on the Board (and intake team) of the Abortion Rights Fund of Western Massachusetts. She is also a founding board member of DARLA, the Doula Association for Reproductive Loss and Abortion, which brought abortion and reproductive loss doula training to the Pioneer Valley for the first time. She also sits on the statewide organizing committees for Medicare for All and helped found the Western Massachusetts Safe Communities Act coalition. She is also an active member of the Northampton Democratic City Committee and frequently represents her ward at the Democratic State Convention.

Sabadosa was first elected to the State House of Representatives in 2018, becoming the first woman to represent the First Hampshire District. In 2020 she was re-elected in an uncontested race. Currently, Sabadosa is the Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on Municipalities and Regional Government. She also serves on the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing and the Joint Committee on Transportation.
