A passionate advocate for local government and public service, Mark brings over 15 years of distinguished experience in state and municipal government.

Mark's career in public service began in Plymouth, where he served the community for 11 years in key leadership roles, including Assistant Town Manager and Town Manager. During his tenure, he successfully negotiated a landmark tax agreement with the nuclear power plant operator, secured an upgrade to the town’s bond rating from AA- to AA, implemented a comprehensive technology master plan for both the town and schools, and oversaw a facilities master plan that culminated in a $199 million public vote to fund school renovations and a new senior center.

At the state level, Mark made significant contributions as part of the Patrick/Murray Administration. He served as the inaugural Green Communities Director, Commissioner of the Department of Energy Resources, and Undersecretary for Energy. Under his leadership, Massachusetts implemented groundbreaking policies in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and alternative transportation. Mark also chaired the Energy Facilities Siting Board and was a commissioner for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, driving forward the state’s clean energy agenda.

Mark holds a bachelor’s degree in political science and a master’s degree in public administration from American University in Washington, D.C. A proud graduate of the Fairhaven Public Schools, he is deeply rooted in his hometown of Fairhaven, where he resides with his son and daughter. Mark has served his community in multiple capacities, including as a Town Meeting Member, a School Committee member, and currently as the elected Town Moderator.
