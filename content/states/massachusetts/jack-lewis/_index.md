Jack Patrick Lewis is an American state legislator from Framingham, Massachusetts. A Democrat, he was sworn in as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives on January 4, 2017. After earning the Democratic nomination on September 8, 2016, Lewis became representative-elect on November 8, earning over 61% of the vote.

In addition to his political involvement, Lewis has served as the executive director of OutMetro West, a nonprofit working with at-risk LGBT youth, and as assistant minister and director of religious education at the Unitarian Universalist Society of Wellesley Hills.

Lewis's father is a retired manufacturing worker and longtime member of the United Automobile Workers (UAW); his mother is a retired preschool teacher in the Head Start program. He grew up in Seville, Ohio. Lewis attended the University of Utah with the support of a UAW scholarship. He triple majored in political science (honors), Middle East studies/Arabic, and international studies, and graduated as the valedictorian of his divisional college. He also attended Eden Theological Seminary, where he received a master of divinity.

Lewis began his political career while in college, serving as an organizer for Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign. He has worked as a HeadStart substitute teacher, taught English in Ghana and Egypt, and worked in a group home for people with disabilities. After receiving his M.Div., Lewis served as assistant minister and director of religious education at the Unitarian Universalist Society of Wellesley Hills in Wellesley, Massachusetts. After several years at the congregation, Lewis stepped down to become a founding member of Out MetroWest, a nonprofit organization providing services for at-risk LGBT youth. During Lewis' tenure as executive director, Out MetroWest worked with over 700 teens, focusing on supportive counseling and community education.

In June 2016, Lewis' work at Out MetroWest was honored with a Nonprofit Excellence Award (Young Professional category) from the Massachusetts Nonprofit Network.
