Jonathan "Jon" D. Zlotnik was born on May 7, 1990, in the United States. He is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. Zlotnik has been serving as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from the 2nd Worcester district since January 2, 2013.

Zlotnik was born to Michael and Mary Ann. He graduated from Gardner High School in 2008 and then from the University of Massachusetts Lowell with a Bachelor of Arts in History in 2012. His thesis was titled "Actors at the End of a Bad Play: The Struggle for Polish Independence, 1796-1945."

Zlotnik gained initial political experience as a summer aide in 2007 and 2008 for Robert Rice. In 2012, while still a senior in college, Zlotnik launched a campaign for the 2nd Worcester seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He ultimately defeated Republican nominee, Richard M. Bastien, in the election, and deferred plans to study at Suffolk University Law School and join the United States Navy. He now serves on the Joint Committee on Education.

In 2020, Zlotnik endorsed Joe Biden and his presidential campaign, as well as Ed Markey for the 2020 Senate election in Massachusetts. In 2022, Zlotnik endorsed Lori Trahan for a seat in the House of Representatives elections in Massachusetts. In 2023, Zlotnik ran for the Worcester and Hampshire district seat in the Massachusetts Senate when incumbent Democrat Anne Gobi resigned in June to take over as the state's Director of Rural Affairs. However, he was defeated by Republican Peter Durant.
