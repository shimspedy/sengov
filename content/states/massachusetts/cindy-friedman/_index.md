Cindy F. Friedman is an American politician currently serving as a state senator representing the 4th Middlesex District in the Massachusetts Senate. Her district comprises Arlington, Billerica, Burlington, Lexington (precincts 1 and 2 and 4 to 7), and Woburn. She has been serving since 2017. Prior to becoming a state senator, Friedman worked as a public school teacher and as a senior manager in the high-tech industry. She later served for nearly a decade as chief of staff to the late state Senator Ken Donnelly.

During her first term, Friedman served as the Senate Chair of the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery. For the 191st General Court, Friedman serves as the Senate Chair of the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing and is vice chair of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means. Early in her career, Friedman served as a community organizer for groups such as Planned Parenthood, advocating for reproductive rights for women. When her children entered Arlington Public Schools, Friedman was a founding member of the Arlington Education Foundation and Schools are a Priority in our Town (SPOT) to support high-quality and equitable educational opportunities in Arlington.

Later, Friedman was elected as an Arlington Town Meeting member, and helped manage the gubernatorial campaigns of Don Berwick and Deval Patrick, as well as the state Senate campaigns of Ken Donnelly. Friedman serves as the Senate Chair of the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing and is vice chair of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means. Additionally, she is a member of the Joint Committee on Transportation, the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery, the Senate Committee on Ethics and the Senate Committee on Rules.

Friedman is the co-chair of the Massachusetts Caucus of Women Legislators, the MBTA Legislative Caucus and the Library Legislative Caucus. She is a Democrat, and a member of the General Courtâ€™s Progressive Caucus. During her first term in office, Friedman helped successfully champion several major pieces of legislation, including bills to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour and implement paid family medical leave, reform the criminal justice system, increase funding for workforce training and development and combat the opioid crisis in Massachusetts. Education, housing, transportation and civil rights are also important legislative priorities for Friedman.
