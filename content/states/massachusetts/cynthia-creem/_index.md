Cynthia Stone Creem, born on September 17, 1942, is an American politician serving in the Massachusetts Senate. She represents the 1st Middlesex and Norfolk district, which includes Brookline, Wellesley, and her hometown of Newton. A member of the Democratic Party, Creem was first elected in 1999 and has served as Majority Leader since 2018. Prior to serving in the Massachusetts legislature, she was an attorney who served on the Massachusetts Governor’s Council and the Newton Board of Aldermen. In late 2011, Creem considered running for Congress in Massachusetts’s 4th congressional district to replace retiring Rep. Barney Frank, but decided to remain in the Massachusetts Senate. The seat was ultimately won by Joe Kennedy III.

Creem is a practicing family law attorney, serving Of Counsel at the Boston law firm Sugarman, Rogers, Barshak & Cohen. In 2018, Creem, along with Senator Anne Gobi, led the fight to pass H.4671, an act automatically registering eligible voters and enhancing safeguards against fraud. The bill created a framework for eligible voters to automatically register to vote when receiving services form the Register of Motor Vehicles and MassHealth. The bill also applies existing penalties for voter fraud to a fine of up to $10,000 or a five-year prison sentence.
