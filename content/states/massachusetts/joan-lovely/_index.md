Senator Lovely serves in Leadership as Assistant Majority Leader and as Chair of the Senate and Joint Committees on Rules. She also serves as Senate Vice-Chair of the Joint Committee on State Administration and Regulatory Oversight, and as a member of the Senate Committees on Ethics, Global Warming and Climate Change, and Juvenile and Emerging Adult Justice, in addition to the Joint Committee on Agriculture. Outside of her committee work, Senator Lovely is the Senate Chair of the Massachusetts Caucus of Women Legislators. She is also a member of several caucuses including the Massachusetts Legislative Food Systems Caucus, Coastal Caucus, Boating Caucus, Zero Waste Caucus, Gateway Cities Caucus, Protecting Animal Welfare (PAW) Caucus and Climate Alliance Caucus.
