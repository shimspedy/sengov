She holds the position of Assistant Minority Leader and has been an influential figure in state politics. Senator Dooner's legislative efforts focus on a wide range of issues, including property tax appraisals, social security number verification for cash assistance eligibility, and the security of electronic benefit transfer cards.

Senator Dooner's political career began with her election to the Taunton City Council in 2021, where she became the youngest woman ever to hold the position. During her tenure, she served as the council president and worked to designate Taunton as a Purple Heart City.

In November 2024, Senator Dooner won the election to the Massachusetts State Senate, representing the 1st Plymouth and Bristol district.

She defeated Democrat and long-term Raynham Selectman Joe Pacheco in a tight race.

Senator Dooner has expressed concerns about the state's spending and policies regarding undocumented migrants. She has criticized the use of hotels as emergency shelters for migrants, advocating for prioritizing housing for military veterans and indigent families who are U.S. citizens. Additionally, she has called for audits of the state's Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card system, citing potential fraud.

Senator Dooner lives in Taunton with her husband, Louis Picardi, and works as a paralegal for a Boston law firm. Her dedication to public service and commitment to addressing the needs of her constituents have made her a respected and influential figure in Massachusetts politics.
