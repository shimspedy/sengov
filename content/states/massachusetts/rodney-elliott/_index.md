Early life and education:
Rodney was born to Francis and Theresa Elliott, in Lowell, Massachusetts. His father was born and raised in the Acre Section of the city, his mother attended St Louis Academy. Rodney's maternal grandparents were both orphans in Franco American orphanage, and both worked in the city's mills. Elliott grew up in the Pawtucketville section of Lowell, Massachusetts. He attended Saint Jeanne d'Arc School during his elementary and middle school years. His family moved to Pelham, New Hampshire when Rodney was in eighth grade. He is the second oldest and only son of a working class family of six children one sister, Karen, passed away as an infant. As an undergraduate, he attended Plymouth State College, and was the first member of his family to graduate. He travelled abroad, as a college student, to the Soviet Union, during the height of the Cold War, and saw firsthand how a totalitarian government suppresses its people. Elliott graduated from Plymouth State in 1982, with a degree in Political Science, and moved back to his hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts.

Political career:
Elliott's first job out of college was as a legislative aide, to then State Senator Phillip Shea. He was primarily focused on constituent services for the Senator. Elliott went on to work for the city of Lowell, as its planner, while simultaneously pursuing his Master's Degree in Public Administration, at Suffolk University, Boston, and bartending at local theatres to pay for his education. He then became the administrative assistant for the town of Groton, Massachusetts. Elliott moved to Washington D.C. to pursue a second master's degree in Political Science, at Catholic University of America. While there, he began his 25 year career at the United States Environmental Protection Agency. He returned to Lowell in 1994 and married Laurie (Machado), and transferred to the EPA Boston office.
