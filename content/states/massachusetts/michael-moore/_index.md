Born and raised in Millbury, Senator Michael O. Moore (D-Millbury) has devoted his entire adult life to public service. A former law enforcement officer, environmental investigator, and town selectman, Senator Moore has an accomplished record of giving back to his community.

A graduate of the Waltham Police Academy, Mike began his 22-year law enforcement career as an Environmental Police officer working for the Department of Environmental Police, eventually assigned as an investigator in the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office. He holds a master’s degree in Criminal Justice from Western New England University.

After being elected to the Millbury Board of Selectmen in 2001, Mike served three terms fighting to improve the quality of life in the town where he grew up. During his tenure on the Board, Mike spearheaded the opening of The Shoppes at Blackstone Valley – the largest economic development project in Millbury history. This expanded the town's commercial tax base by more than $1 million annually and provided employment opportunities for residents of Millbury and the surrounding communities. He was re-elected to the Board of Selectmen in 2004 and 2007.

In 2005, Mike was appointed Assistant Deputy Superintendent at the Worcester County Sheriff’s office, where he oversaw the Community Service Program, inmate reintegration program, and senior citizen community outreach safety programs. Under his leadership, the Sheriff's Office created the Worcester County TRIAD senior citizen program, working to identify and address senior citizen safety concerns with programs that include house numbering, 911 Cell Phone Bank, Beacon of Light, File for Life, and many more. Mike was also responsible for the development of the Area Law Enforcement Response Transmission (ALERT) program, which sends a daily email out to law enforcement officials on recently released inmates, and the Responsible Fatherhood Initiative, a Department of Revenue sponsored program that confirms parenthood of inmates to reduce welfare fraud.

Senator Moore was elected to represent the people of the Second Worcester District in the Massachusetts Senate in November 2008. His district includes the Towns of Auburn, Grafton, Millbury, Shrewsbury, and Westborough, as well as Ward 4 Precincts 1, 2A, 4, 5, 6, Ward 5, Ward 6, Precincts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, Ward 7 Precinct 5A, Ward 8 Precinct 5 in the City of Worcester.

Immediately upon taking office in 2009, Senator Moore declined to take a pay raise given to members of the Legislature, believing it irresponsible to accept a raise for a job he had not yet begun, especially given the dire budget situation facing the state. Since then, Senator Moore has worked hard for the residents of the district, filing legislation that prioritizes public safety, fiscal responsibility, and investments in municipal infrastructure.

Since joining the Massachusetts Senate, Senator Moore has been involved with a number of committees and task forces, most recently being appointed to serve as chair of the Joint Committee on Advanced Information Technology, the Internet and Cybersecurity, and vice chair of the Joint Committee on Financial Services. He also serves on the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, the Joint Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets, the Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security, the Joint Committee on Revenue, and the Joint Committee on Ways and Means.
