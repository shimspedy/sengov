Nick Collins is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He currently serves as a member of the Massachusetts Senate, representing the First Suffolk District. Collins assumed office on May 9, 2018, succeeding Linda Dorcena Forry. Prior to his tenure in the Senate, he served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from January 5, 2011, to May 9, 2018, representing the 4th Suffolk District.

In the Senate, Collins serves as the Chair of the Joint Committee on State Administration and Regulatory Oversight and the Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on Community Development and Small Businesses. He is also a member of several other committees including the Senate Committee on Bills in the Third Reading, and the Joint Committees on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets; Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery; and Public Service.

Born on August 26, 1982, in South Boston, Massachusetts, Collins was raised in a family of six siblings. He is a graduate of Boston Latin School and The Frederick Gunn School, where he played hockey. He earned a bachelor’s degree in business management from Babson College. His father, James Collins, was a state representative from Charlestown who also worked in the administrations of Boston Mayor Kevin White and Massachusetts Governor Edward J. King. Collins began his career in public service as a legislative aide to Massachusetts Senator Jack Hart and was also a regional field director for the Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign.

Collins was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives seat for the 4th Suffolk District in 2010. In May 2018, he won the election for the open Massachusetts Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry. He was sworn into the Massachusetts Senate on May 9, 2018, by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker. His district, one of four minority-majority state senate districts in Massachusetts, is entirely inside Boston’s city limits, and includes all of South Boston and parts of the Dorchester, Mattapan and Hyde Park neighborhoods. As senator for the 1st Suffolk District, Collins has been the host of the annual Boston’s St. Patrick’s Day Breakfast since 2019, a televised political roast that has featured presidents, vice-presidents, United States Senators and members of Congress throughout its history.
