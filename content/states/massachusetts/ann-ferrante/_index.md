Ann-Margaret Ferrante, born on June 26, 1972, is an American legislator serving as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. She represents the 5th Essex district, which includes Gloucester, Rockport, and Essex. A member of the Democratic Party, Ferrante was first elected in 2008 after defeating incumbent representative Anthony Verga in the Democratic primary.

Born and raised in Gloucester, Massachusetts, Ferrante is the daughter of a fisherman and a school librarian. She graduated from Gloucester High School and went on to study Economics and International Relations at Tufts University in Boston. After receiving her Bachelor of Arts in 1994 from Tufts University, Ferrante worked as the legislative aide for State Representative Bruce Tarr. In 1996, she left her position with Tarr to pursue a Juris Doctor from Suffolk University Law School. Ferrante was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar Association in 1999.

Shortly after graduating from Suffolk Law, Ferrante started her own law firm in Gloucester, where she focused on land use and fishing issues. She also served as counsel for the Northeast Seafood Coalition, where she began working to reform the regulatory practices affecting commercial fisherman. Ferrante holds a Master of Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

In her role as a State Representative, Ferrante has served on numerous boards and commissions in the community, including Cape Ann Commercial Fishermanâ€™s Loan Fund, Sawyer Free Library, and as an incorporator with Cape Ann Savings Bank. She has been a dedicated and persistent advocate on behalf of the people of Cape Ann, working tirelessly on advocacy issues pertaining to fisheries, education, the disabled, small businesses, and economic development for Cape Ann. She has spearheaded the effort to engage new technology for stock assessments to save the fishing industry and is working to retain local businesses and bring new industries like marine biotech to the area. In addition, she is a big supporter of the creative economy and, working with the MA Cultural Council, was instrumental in bringing Cultural Districts to Cape Ann in order to retain and expand tourism and the arts and the economic benefits they provide.
