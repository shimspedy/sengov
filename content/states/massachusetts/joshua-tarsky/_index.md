Representative Joshua Tarsky matriculated to Yale University in the Fall of 2001, and his life's trajectory changed on September 11th.  He couldn't quite shake the question "why not me?" and upon graduation he enlisted in the US Army as a Special Forces (Green Beret) soldier, serving two tours in Afghanistan and one in Honduras. Throughout his military service, Josh saw firsthand how crucial sound laws and a strong education system are to a societyâ€™s well-being. Returning stateside, he earned a Master's in Education from Harvard University and a Juris Doctorate from Suffolk University while working as an English and English as a Second Language teacher at Lawrence High School.  He then transitioned to school administration, serving as Assistant Principal of Sandwich High and then Principal of Holbrook Middle-High School, until being elected as State Representative of the 13th Norfolk District. He continues his military service as a Major and Judge Advocate General in the Massachusetts National Guard.
