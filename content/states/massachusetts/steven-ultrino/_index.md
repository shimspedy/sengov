Throughout his career, Ultrino has been a strong advocate for quality education, securing millions of dollars for infrastructure improvement in Ward 2 and fighting for the rights of Malden children to receive high-quality instruction.

Ultrino's community involvement extends beyond his political career. He served sixteen years as President of the St. Rocco Society and seven years as a board member and past Chairman of the Malden YMCA. Currently, he serves on the Board of Monsignor Neagle Housing Association and is a member of the Malden Kiwanis. He is also a lifetime member of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

Professionally, Ultrino has a diverse background. He served as the Director of Education for the Middlesex Sheriff’s Office, where he worked to educate, retrain, and repurpose inmates to reduce their rate of recidivism and help them become productive members of society upon their release from incarceration. Prior to working at the Middlesex Sheriff’s Office, he taught business and economics at Malden Catholic High School and served as school principal and business manager at St. Mary’s Parish in Winchester.
