Carlos Gonzalez is a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, representing the 10th Hampden District. He was elected to the House of Representatives on November 4, 2014, with a significant majority of the votes.

Before his political career, Carlos was a social worker for the Massachusetts Department of Social Services. In 1993, he was contracted as General Manager to build and manage WSPR 1270AM Spanish Radio Station, which became the number one Spanish language radio station in Western MA in 1994. He also opened his own small business, “Hispanic Marketing Services,” in 1995.

From 1996 to 2004, Carlos served as the first Hispanic Aide to the Mayor in Springfield, MA, and was promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff in 1999. In 2004, he worked as a legislative aide for State Representative Steve Buonoconti.

In the same year, Carlos founded the Massachusetts Latino Chamber of Commerce, where he serves as President/CEO. Over the last ten years, the chamber has assisted 2000 members to start or grow their business.

Carlos is also the President/CEO of Nueva Esperanza. Hired in 2012, he reorganized the financially strapped agency and reestablished the organization as a powerful community champion of the poor.

Carlos is married and a father of five children. He has received special recognition, including the 2009 U.S. Small Business Administration Massachusetts Minority Small Business Champion Award. He has also served on various boards and committees, contributing significantly to his community.
