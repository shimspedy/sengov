Antonio F. D. “Tony” Cabral is a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, representing the 13th Bristol District. He is affiliated with the Democratic Party.

Born on January 26, 1955, on Pico Island, Cabral emigrated from the Azores to Bristol, Rhode Island, with his family when he was 14 years old. Despite not speaking English upon arrival in the United States, he attended school during the day and worked at night to support his family.

Cabral graduated from Bristol Community College and Southeastern Massachusetts University (now UMass Dartmouth) and began a career as a public school teacher. He taught languages and social studies in Taunton, Plymouth, and Carver, Massachusetts, before entering politics.

Cabral was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1990. He is the current chairman of the House Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures, and State Assets and also serves on the Special Joint Committee on Redistricting. As a State Representative, Cabral has worked to extend historic tax credits, pass anti-bullying legislation, secure education funds for New Bedford, and strengthen registration requirements for sex offenders. He is also a supporter of New Bedford’s fishermen and the South Coast Rail.

In 2011, Cabral ran for Mayor of New Bedford against City Councilor Linda M. Morad and Assistant United States Attorney Jon Mitchell. However, he was defeated in the mayoral race by Mitchell. Despite the setback, Cabral continues to serve in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and remains a prominent figure in local politics.
