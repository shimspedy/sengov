Before his election to the State House, Flanagan served two successive terms on the Dennis Select Board, three of those years as the chair of the board.

Throughout the 2022 General Election campaign, Flanagan campaigned on seven key issues: improved access to care for seniors, the strengthening of public education, promotion of affordable housing, the safeguarding of reproductive healthcare, gun safety, expanded resources for veterans and first responders, and the improvement of coastal resiliency on Cape Cod.
