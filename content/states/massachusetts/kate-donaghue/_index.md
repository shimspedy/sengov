Kate Donaghue, a member of the Democratic Party, represents the 19th Worcester District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. She assumed office on January 4, 2023, and her current term ends on January 1, 2025. Donaghue ran for election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives to represent the 19th Worcester District and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Donaghue was a superdelegate to the 2016 Democratic National Convention from Massachusetts. She was one of 24 superdelegates from Massachusetts. Superdelegates to the 2016 Democratic National Convention were not bound by the results of their stateâ€™s primary or caucus results to support a specific presidential candidate. Donaghue supported Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Clinton formally won the Democratic nomination for president on July 26, 2016.

Kate Donaghue earned an M.S. in medical technology from Northeastern University in 1983 and an M.S. in computer science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1988. Donaghue served as the chair of the Long Trail Protection Fund Committee.

Donaghue grew up in a large family, with a dad who started an insurance agency, and a mom who took care of eight kids. She came to Westborough as a student, where she worked part time and during summers to put herself through college. She went on to earn two graduate degrees during her career, first as a medical technologist and then as a software developer. She and her husband, Kimball, sent their son, Brian, and her stepdaughter, Josselyn, to Westborough Public Schools, where both graduated from Westborough High.
