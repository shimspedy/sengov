Born on April 17, 1979, in Framingham, Massachusetts, Gregoire is a lifelong resident of Marlborough, MA and a graduate of the Marlborough Public School system. She received her bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice from St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, graduating Cum Laude.

While working for Representative LeDuc, Gregoire attended night classes at Suffolk University Law School where she graduated in 2006. She passed the Massachusetts bar exam and is a member of the MA Bar.
