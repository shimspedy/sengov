State Senator Jamie Eldridge has served as State Senator for the Middlesex and Worcester district since January 2009.

Previously, Senator Eldridge served as State Representative for the 37th Middlesex district, after being elected the only Clean Elections candidate to public office in Massachusetts history in November 2002.

Since then, Senator Eldridge has focused his energies in the House and in the Senate on enhancing public education, stimulating the economy, promoting campaign and ethics reform, protecting the environment, improving public safety, expanding access to health care, and improving public transportation.

Senator Eldridge is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and Boston College Law School, where he served as President of the Public Interest Law Foundation (PILF) for two years. Prior to his election as State Representative, Jamie worked as a public interest attorney with Merrimack Valley Legal Services in Lowell, a non-profit organization that provides free legal services to the poor and the elderly. As a public interest lawyer, he also worked to help low-income residents with issues of housing, Social Security, disability, and unemployment.
