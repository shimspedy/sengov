Dennis is currently running for State Representative for the 8th Plymouth District which encompasses the towns of Bridgewater and Raynham Massachusetts.

Dennis has lived in Bridgewater, MA for the past 29 years. He grew up in neighboring East Bridgewater where he graduated from East Bridgewater High School in 1981.  

After High School Dennis served in the United States Navy from 1981-1985. After being Honorably discharged in 1985 he attended Worcester State College (University) and graduated in 1989 with a Bachelors’ degree in Communications. He also served as class President all four years at Worcester State. 

During Dennis’ time in the service and at Worcester State he lost his parents to illnesses. Although completing military service and a Bachelors’ degree in eight years were great accomplishments, his hardships and adversities during those times, he knew that many more challenges were ahead of him.  But he always kept focus and set goals and objectives knowing that he had to support himself as he entered different stages of his life. 

From 1992-1996 Dennis attended evening classes and earned a Masters’ Degree in Public Administration from Suffolk University’s School of Management in 1996.
