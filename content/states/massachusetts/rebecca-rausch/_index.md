Becca Rausch is the Massachusetts State Senator representing the Norfolk, Bristol and Middlesex District. She is the third woman, the second Democrat, and the first Jewish person to hold her seat. Senator Rausch was elected in November 2018 and sworn into office on January 2, 2019. Prior to her election to the Legislature, Senator Rausch worked for over a decade as a practicing attorney.

Her work spanned both the private and public sectors, including several years at the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, where she earned a Citation for Outstanding Performance. Senator Rausch is also a former elected local legislator, union steward, and law professor. Her areas of expertise include health law and policy, information governance and knowledge management, and data privacy and security.

The granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor and a published author on reproductive health and justice and body size and the law, Senator Rausch is a lifelong advocate for social justice, fairness, and equality for all. She holds degrees from Brandeis University (B.A.), Northeastern University School of Law (J.D.), and the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law (LL.M.).

Senator Rausch lives in Needham with her husband, their two young children, and their dog (a big, floppy Goldendoodle).
