Andy Vargas is a talented individual with a diverse range of skills and experiences. He is known for his masterful, soulful voice as the lead vocalist for the legendary rock band Santana. Born in Australia on July 3, 1977, Andy was raised in a traditional Mexican household in Watsonville, located on the Central California Coast. His love and passion for music were fueled by his father, Javier Vargas, who introduced him to music at a young age. By the age of seven, Andy was performing with his father’s mariachi band, Mariachi California De Javier Vargas.

Andy’s dedication to his music career earned him a recording contract with RCA / BMG. In 1999, he auditioned for the Santana Band and by the year 2000, he started to tour as a singer on the Supernatural World Tour with Carlos Santana. Today, Andy still tours and delivers vocals for the Santana Band while developing his new production company, Vargas Entertainment.

In addition to his music career, Andy is also an accomplished DJ, producer, songwriter, and visionary. He has performed and recorded with talents such as Juanes, Beyonce, Enrique Iglesias, and many more. Andy has created his own special genre of music, which has gained the attention of acclaimed comedian George Lopez. Together with 800 Pound Gorilla Records and Warner Music, Andy and George are in the beta stage of their new record label, Malaspalabras Records.

Andy is also known for his philanthropic efforts. In 2015, he launched The Andy Vargas Foundation (AVF), a nonprofit organization with a mission to inspire, educate, and mentor underserved youth who strive for a career in the music industry. The AVF provides youth with free community programs that include a Music Conservatory; Music Composition & Production Academy; and College Scholarships that are critical in paving the way for underserved youth to achieve their artistic dreams.

Andy Vargas is not only one of the great voices of our time and an incredible performer, but he is also an honest, ethical individual with a huge heart and an endlessly positive spirit. His multiple solo projects are an indication of his “always-on” creative vision. His work in the music industry represents the future of music creativity and industry intellect for the next generation.
