Joseph McGonagle Jr. is a member of the Democratic Party and represents the 28th Middlesex District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 7, 2015, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025. McGonagle was first elected to the chamber in 2014 and has been re-elected since then, with his latest victory coming in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Throughout his tenure, McGonagle has been assigned to various committees. For the 2023-2024 legislative session, he was assigned to the Operations, Facilities and Security Committee (as Chair), Education Joint Committee, and Public Safety and Homeland Security Joint Committee. In the past, he has also served on the Housing Joint Committee (as Vice Chair), Health Care Financing Joint Committee (as Vice Chair), and Transportation Joint Committee.

McGonagle's personal career in public service goes back to 2002, but his roots in Everett, Massachusetts, and his desire to give back to the community he has always called home goes back generations. He was raised in a family that gave much to the community and is proud to be a third-generation City official.
