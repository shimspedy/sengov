Senator Bill Driscoll Jr. is a dedicated public servant who has represented the Norfolk, Plymouth, and Bristol District in the Massachusetts State Senate since January 1, 2025. Before his tenure in the Senate, he served as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives for the 7th Norfolk District from January 4, 2017, to January 1, 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, Driscoll's district includes portions of the towns of Milton and Randolph.

Born and raised in Milton, Massachusetts, Bill Driscoll attended St. Agatha School for grades K-8 before moving on to Boston College High School. He later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications from Boston College in 2005. His early career was marked by a strong commitment to disaster response and humanitarian aid. For over a decade, Driscoll worked in the U.S. disaster response sector, culminating in his role as Executive Director of NECHAMA â€“ Jewish Response to Disaster from 2011 to 2016.

Driscoll's political career began in 2016 when he won the Democratic primary for the Massachusetts House of Representatives with 21.3% of the vote against six other candidates. He faced no opposition in the general election and subsequently ran unopposed in all subsequent House elections. During his time in the House, Driscoll served as the House Chair of the Joint Committee on Emergency Preparedness and Management, a committee created in 2021 to oversee the Commonwealth's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and address broader crisis and emergency preparedness issues.

In 2024, Driscoll won the three-way Democratic primary for the Norfolk, Plymouth, and Bristol Senate District and secured an uncontested victory in the November General Election. As a State Senator, Driscoll continues to advocate for his constituents and work on issues related to emergency preparedness, public health, and community resilience.

Throughout his career, Driscoll has been recognized for his leadership and dedication to public service. He has responded to over 40 disasters in the U.S. and has worked in Peru and Mexico. His extensive experience in disaster response and humanitarian aid has made him a sought-after leader in the nonprofit sector, where he has held executive leadership roles for three organizations, including Interim President and CEO of National VOAD, the nonprofit industry's association for organizations active in disaster response.

Bill Driscoll is a devoted husband and father of two sons. He and his family reside in Milton, Massachusetts, where he remains deeply connected to his community. As a State Senator, Driscoll looks forward to continuing his work on behalf of his constituents and advocating for their shared priorities in the Norfolk, Plymouth, and Bristol District.
