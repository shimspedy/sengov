State Senator Adam Gomez (D-Springfield) is a life long native of western Massachusetts. He is a proud Boricua, a father of three, a former small business owner, and a tireless advocate for Veterans and Black and Latino communities. He is also the first Latino from the Hampden District to serve in the Massachusetts Senate.

His personal beliefs and experiences have driven his years of advocacy work for social justice issues such as criminal justice reform, immigrant rights, education issues, and civil rights. He has served as a member of various boards for local organizations in his District, many of which directly serve the Latino community. Prior to becoming a Senator he served as a Springfield City Councilor.

Having just completed his first term in office for the 2021-22 legislative session, Senator Gomez has already helped pass several landmark pieces of legislation into law this session through bills he sponsored that: ensure membership of the state’s Victim and Witness Assistance Board has equitable and fair representation; improve processes related to the expungement of one’s cannabis expungement records; provide undocumented immigrants the ability to have a driver’s license; and eliminate hair discrimination from our workplace and schools.

Senator Gomez proudly serves the Hampden District, consisting of the communities Springfield and Chicopee. He serves as the Senate Chair of the Joint Committee on Children, Families and Persons with Disabilities and Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on Election Laws.
