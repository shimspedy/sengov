Representative Bridget Plouffe is a dedicated and passionate public servant who represents the 9th Plymouth District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. A member of the Democratic Party, she assumed office on January 1, 2025, after winning the general election on November 5, 2024. Her current term is set to end on January 6, 2027. 

Bridget is a lifelong resident of the district. She grew up with two brothers and attended Brockton Public Schools through middle school. She went on to attend Fontbonne Academy, a girls school in Milton, where she immersed herself in extra curriculars, including National Honor Society and service club, and excelled as the starting varsity softball pitcher.

 

After graduating from Fontbonne Bridget attended Providence College, graduating with her Bachelor of Arts in Psychology in 2015. Her desire to serve her community was evident through her college career: serving as an Executive Board member on Special Olympics and Relay for Life and spending time tutoring high school students. 

​

Upon her graduation from Providence she returned to her hometown to work for the Brockton Public Schools, until she was hired by Representative Gerry Cassidy in 2016. Bridget worked as Representative Cassidy’s legislative aide for several years before becoming his Chief of Staff. She currently serves as the Chief of Staff for the Joint Committee on Veterans and Federal Affairs. As the granddaughter of a Korean War Veteran and the sister of a Marine Pilot, she is committed to bettering the lives of veterans in the Commonwealth.

​

Bridget currently lives in Brockton with her husband, a Brockton firefighter, her two stepchildren and their two rambunctious rescue dogs!
