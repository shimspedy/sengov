Josh S. Cutler, born on January 22, 1971, is an attorney and a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He represents the 6th Plymouth district of Massachusetts, which includes every precinct in the towns of Pembroke and Hanson, and precincts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of Duxbury.

Cutler was elected on November 6, 2012, becoming the first Democrat to hold the seat for the 6th Plymouth District dating back to the Reconstruction era. He grew up in Duxbury and Marshfield and later graduated from Skidmore College with a B.A. in political science and from Suffolk University Law School. He also earned a master's degree in public policy from UMass-Dartmouth.

For ten years, Cutler served as editor, and later publisher, of the Duxbury Clipper, a family-run newspaper first established by his grandparent in 1950. Cutler expanded the business, launching new publications, acquiring others, and bringing printing operations in-house.

In addition to his legislative duties, Cutler is an elected member of the Duxbury Planning Board and Duxbury Democratic Town Committee. He is also a member of the Duxbury Alternative Energy Committee and co-chairs the Solar Energy Subcommittee. Prior to moving back to Duxbury, Cutler served for three years as a Selectman in the Town of Hull. An active volunteer, Cutler serves on the board of directors for the Duxbury Free Library, Inc., the Duxbury Rural & Historical Society, the Duxbury Business Association, and Pembroke Chamber of Commerce. He is a Meal on Wheels driver and a member of the Duxbury 375th Committee and the War Memorial Committee.
