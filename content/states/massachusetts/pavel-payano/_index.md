Pavel Payano is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He represents the 1st Essex District in the Massachusetts State Senate. Payano was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 4, 2023. He succeeded Diana DiZoglio in this role.

Payano has a strong educational background. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a Master of Science in public affairs from the University of Massachusetts Boston, and a Juris Doctor from Suffolk University Law School.

Before his election to the State Senate, Payano had a diverse career. In 2006 and 2007, he worked as the Massachusetts outreach director for the Democratic National Committee. From 2007 to 2009, he served as a special assistant and immigration specialist for Congresswoman Niki Tsongas. From 2009 to 2011, he served as a benefits eligibility social worker in the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services. Payano later worked as a project manager for the University of Massachusetts Lowell and managed Juana Matiasâ€™s 2016 campaign for the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He was also an adjunct professor at Merrimack College and chaired the Boston chapter of the Association of Latino Professionals For America. Payano served as a member of the Lawrence City Council from 2018 to 2022.

Payano is the son of immigrant Lawrencians who dedicated decades to the LPS system. From a very young age, he learned the importance of hard work and the value of a quality education. He also witnessed, by way of strong unions, that communal success is possible when we share a commitment to serving others. He takes those values with him as he represents the First Essex District which includes the communities of Methuen, Lawrence, and parts of Haverhill. Prior to his election to the State Senate, Senator Payano served the city of Lawrence for over a decade, first as a School Committee member and most recently as a City Councilor At-Large. He has experience working as a Social Worker for the Department of Transitional Assistance and as a Professor at Merrimack College, where he taught graduate classes. Senator Payano is committed to advancing policies that support education reform, public health, and community development. He lives in Lawrence with his dog, Teja.
