Sarah K. Peake is an American politician from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She is a member of the Democratic Party and has been serving in the Massachusetts House of Representatives since 2007. She represents the Fourth Barnstable district, a Cape Cod district that includes her hometown of Provincetown.

Born on October 4, 1957, Sarah Peake earned an A.B. from Colgate University and a Juris Doctor from Pace University School of Law. Before her political career, she moved to Provincetown in 1992, where she and her wife Lynn purchased and ran a bed and breakfast for 23 years.

Sarah Peake’s political career began when she was elected to the Provincetown Board of Selectmen in 2002. She first ran for state representative in 2004, facing Republican incumbent Shirley Gomes. Although she was defeated in this election, she ran again for the seat in 2006 when Gomes decided against seeking re-election. This time, she won the Democratic primary against two opponents and went on to win the general election.

Throughout her tenure, Sarah Peake has been a fierce advocate for her district and all Cape Codders. She leads on housing initiatives, rural transportation issues, environmental and climate change legislation, and civil rights. She has brought home millions of dollars to support affordable housing, and to address hunger, public transportation, school funding, and dredging.

In 2021, Sarah Peake was appointed Second Assistant Majority Leader, a member of the Speaker’s team who serves a resource to other members for guidance and discussion on legislative priorities and concerns. She also currently serves as the Chair of the Regional Transit Authority caucus and helped to create the rural caucus. She is serving as the MA Legislative Commissioner on the Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission since 2009. Previously, Sarah served as the Chair of the Joint Committee on Municipalities and Regional Government and Joint Committee on Tourism, Arts and Cultural Development.
