Patricia D. Jehlen is a member of the Massachusetts State Senate, representing the 2nd Middlesex District, which includes the cities of Cambridge, Medford and Somerville, and the town of Winchester. She is a member of the Democratic Party and has served the Massachusetts State Senate since 2005. Prior to this, she served the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1991 to 2003.

Born on October 14, 1943, in Austin, Texas, Jehlen later attended Swarthmore College, receiving a B.A. in history, and Harvard University, completing a master’s degree in teaching. She also received a second master’s degree from the University of Massachusetts Boston, in history. Jehlen began her career as a secondary school history teacher and later taught a course in Health Politics and Public Policy at the Boston University School of Public Health.

In 1976, Jehlen was elected to the Somerville School Committee, where she served until 1991. During this time, she was among the founders of the CHOICE program, a public school alternative elementary program, and helped found the Council for Fair School Finance, which brought a successful lawsuit leading to the Massachusetts education reform of 1993.

As a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, Jehlen served as Co-Chairman of the Progressive Legislator’s Group (PLG), Co-Chairman of the Elder Caucus, and Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Elder Affairs. Among her successful legislation were bills to increase literacy for blind people, ensure the rights of people living with mental illness, and provide compensation for the wrongfully convicted. As chair of the Progressive Legislators Group and member of the Working Families Agenda in the House, Jehlen helped raise the minimum wage and won tax cuts for working families.

Jehlen continues to serve her community and the state of Massachusetts with dedication and commitment.
