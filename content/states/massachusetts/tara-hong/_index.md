Along with his mother and sister, Tara emigrated from Cambodia to Lowell, Massachusetts, in 2013 with the help of his stepfather. Despite facing the challenges of limited English proficiency and financial constraints, the warmth and acceptance offered by the Lowell community enabled the family to rebuild their lives.

Tara began his academic journey at Stoklosa Middle School in Lowell’s Acre neighborhood. He later attended Lowell High School, Middlesex Community College, and UMass Lowell, eventually earning a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science with a minor in Criminal Justice. Tara has cherished his years in Lowell and remains committed to the community through active involvement in volunteer work.

Tara first got involved with the community by volunteering for Lowell nonprofits. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tara delivered diapers and food to families in need across the city. He volunteered with Lowell Litter Krewe in 2021 and was later invited to serve on the board of directors. Since then, Tara has extended his time and efforts to various nonprofits around the city, including Mill City Grows, where he served on the board from 2021 to 2024. Tara also served on the board of Cambodian Mutual Assistance Association's (CMAA) from 2023 to 2024.  

Professionally, Tara worked as the Program Assistant at the Asian American Center for Excellence & Engagement at UMass Lowell, serving the university's Asian American population to ensure their success. Before that, he was a Program Coordinator at Project LEARN, where he supported Lowell students in achieving educational success. One of his first roles was as the Civic Engagement Coordinator at CMAA, where he encouraged community members to participate in the democratic process by voting on Election Day. At the same time, he worked to provide resources and support through the organization to help improve the quality of life in Lowell.

Through these roles, Tara has gained a deep understanding of the daily struggles faced by many community members. Recognizing the importance of clear communication between leaders and constituents, he emphasizes the need for proactive engagement to address concerns and implement initiatives that improve residents' lives. This commitment to positive change is one of the main reasons Tara decided to run for office—to address the challenges the community faces and to work toward better outcomes.
