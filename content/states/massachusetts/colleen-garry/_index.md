Colleen M. Garry, born on July 21, 1962, in Lowell, Massachusetts, is an American politician who represents the 36th Middlesex District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. She has been serving in this position since 1995.

Garry graduated from the University of Lowell and Suffolk University Law School. Before her political career, she worked as an aide to State Representative John Cox, who represented Dracut and part of Lowell. In 1994, she was elected to represent a new district consisting of Dracut, Tyngsborough, and Dunstable. Dunstable has since been transferred to a neighboring district so the current district consists only of Dracut and Tyngsborough.

She is known as a conservative member of the House Democratic Caucus. In 2015, Representative Garry came under fire for comments criticizing an act of civil disobedience which obstructed a major Massachusetts highway. Representative Garry accused protestors affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement of being "terrorists" and claimed that "structural racism is a fraud."
