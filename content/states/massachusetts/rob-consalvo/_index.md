Rob Consalvo, born on July 16, 1969, is a member of the Democratic Party and currently serves as a representative for the 14th Suffolk District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. His political career began nearly 30 years ago when he started working as an aide to Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy after graduating from Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, with a degree in Political Science.

Consalvo held various positions in Senator Kennedy's office, including staff assistant and press assistant, in both Washington, DC, and Boston. He also served as a Legislative Aide in the office of Massachusetts State Representative Angelo M. Scaccia.

Inspired by his experience in public service, Consalvo decided to run for public office. In 2002, he was elected to the Boston City Council in a special election. He served 12 years as the City Councilor from District 5, which includes the neighborhoods of Hyde Park, Readville, Roslindale, and Mattapan. During his tenure on the Boston City Council, Consalvo chaired the committees on Public Safety, Housing, and Ways and Means.

After serving on the Boston City Council, Consalvo became Deputy Director for the City of Boston's Boston Home Center, which plays a crucial role in executing the city's housing and homeownership policy. He also served as a Trustee on the City of Boston's Neighborhood Housing Trust and the SEIU 888 Housing Trust.

Consalvo also worked as Senior Advisor to the Superintendent of the Boston Public Schools, where he oversaw School Committee relations, Intergovernmental Relations, Interdepartmental Relations, and constituent services, among other special projects.

Today, Consalvo serves as the State Representative for the 14th Suffolk District, representing the Boston neighborhoods of Hyde Park, Roslindale, Readville, and West Roxbury. He currently serves on the Committees on COVID-19 & Emergency Preparedness & Management, Housing, Revenue and Bonding, Capital Expenditures, and State Assets.

Consalvo is the proud father of three Boston Public Schools students, Amanda, Anthony, and Austin, and lives in Hyde Park with his wife Michelle.
