Hadley Luddy is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, representing the 4th Barnstable District. She assumed office on January 1, 2025, after winning the general election on November 5, 2024. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, Hadley has a strong educational background, having earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and a graduate degree in administration, planning, and social policy from Harvard University.

Before entering politics, Hadley had a distinguished career in the nonprofit sector. She served as the CEO of the Homeless Prevention Council, where she worked tirelessly to support vulnerable populations and address homelessness in her community. Additionally, she held the position of vice president at Community Connections and was the executive director of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cape Cod & the Islands. Her extensive experience in these roles has equipped her with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by her constituents and the skills needed to advocate for meaningful change.

As a state representative, Hadley is committed to addressing a wide range of issues that impact her district and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She has sponsored and co-sponsored numerous bills aimed at improving public health, safety, and the environment. Some of her notable legislative efforts include advocating for the regulation of helium balloons, the establishment of a poet laureate position for the Commonwealth, and the implementation of stricter standards for the application of fertilizers and pesticides in the town of Orleans. Hadley is also a strong supporter of initiatives to increase cellular coverage, protect LGBT and HIV-positive seniors, and raise awareness about inflammatory breast cancer in nursing education.

Hadley's dedication to public service extends beyond her legislative work. She is actively involved in her community and is passionate about promoting civic engagement and social justice. Her commitment to these values is evident in her efforts to improve housing and safety standards in communities around aging nuclear power plants and high-level nuclear waste dump sites. She has also championed the cause of divesting from fossil fuel companies and preventing the discharge of radioactive materials.

Throughout her career, Hadley has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of her constituents. Her leadership, compassion, and dedication to public service make her a respected and influential figure in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. As she continues to serve her district, Hadley remains focused on addressing the pressing issues facing her community and working towards a brighter future for all residents of the Commonwealth.
