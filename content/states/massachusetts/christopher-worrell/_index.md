Christopher Worrell is a member of the Democratic Party and represents the 5th Suffolk District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 4, 2023.

Born in Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., Worrell grew up with his brother, Brian Worrell, on Hewins Street in Dorchester. His parents had moved to Boston from the Caribbean. In his youth, he participated in METCO; later, he attended Bunker Hill Community College in Charlestown.
