Tackey Chan is an American state legislator serving in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He represents the 2nd Norfolk district and is a member of the Democratic Party. He and Donald Wong were the first Asian-Americans elected to the Massachusetts General Court.

Chan was born on August 10, 1973, in Boston, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Wollaston section of Quincy. He attended Brandeis University where he received his Bachelor of Arts in Politics in 1995. He later attended the New England School of Law to earn his Juris Doctor degree.

He first won election to the state legislature in the fall of 2010 and took office in the spring of 2011. He has been re-elected multiple times since then, often running unopposed.
