Kate Lipper-Garabedian is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She represents the 32nd Middlesex district in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Before her current role, she served as a City Councillor in Melrose, Massachusetts.

Lipper-Garabedian holds a BA in English and History from the University of Virginia, and a JD from Harvard Law School. She was a seventh-grade teacher with Teach for America from 2003 to 2005 before becoming an attorney.

She served on the Melrose, MA City Council, representing the at-large district, from 2018 to 2020. In 2020, Lipper-Garabedian won a special election to represent the 32nd Middlesex district in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, after former Representative Paul A. Brodeur was elected Mayor of Melrose. She won the primary against two opponents, with 68.1% of the vote, and won the general election with 81.5% of the vote.

She was sworn in on March 25; due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ceremony took place at the foot of the Grand Staircase in the State House, rather than during a formal House session (as would typically happen). She has been endorsed by the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus.
