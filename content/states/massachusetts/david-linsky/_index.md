David Paul Linsky, born on October 16, 1957, in Boston, Massachusetts, is an American lawyer and politician. He currently represents the 5th Middlesex District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

A lifelong resident of Natick, Massachusetts, Linsky graduated from Natick High School and went on to earn his B.A. from Colby College and his J.D. from Boston College Law School. He is a graduate of the Career Prosecutor School in Houston, Texas.

From 1980 to 1999, Linsky was a Natick Town Meeting Member. From 1984 to 1988, he served on the Natick Conservation Commission. From 1983 to 1988 and again from 1991 to 1999, Linsky was an Assistant District Attorney in Middlesex County. As an ADA, he prosecuted hundreds of cases including sexual assault, murder, and white-collar crime.

Linsky was first elected to the House in 1999 in the special election to succeed Douglas Stoddart, who resigned after he was appointed as a judge in Middlesex District Court. Linsky defeated former Natick Selectman John F. Moran in the Democratic primary and in the general election, he defeated Republican Kenneth B. Hoyt and Independent Jerry L. Pierce.

Linsky served as Chair of the House Committee on Post Audit and Oversight for twelve years and formerly served as the House Chair of the Joint Committee on Federal Stimulus Oversight. He is considered a national leader in state legislation in the area of gun violence prevention, was an original supporter of Massachusetts' first in the nation Universal Health Insurance Law, the forerunner to the Affordable Care Act, and was an early leader in Massachusetts Equal Marriage movement. He also was instrumental in securing funding for several new public schools in his District, including Natick High School and the Kennedy and Wilson Middle Schools.

He and his former wife Lois have three children. On July 1, 2021, the Internal Revenue Service filed a lien against Linsky for $154,067 in unpaid income taxes related to his law office income. Linsky stated that the debt was due to "a number of family issues and business issues, unrelated to his work as a state representative". He also stated that he was on a payment plan to repay the taxes, had already paid back some of the money, was current in his payments, and was appealing the lien.
