Duane Robert Quam II was born on July 2, 1960, in Rochester, Minnesota, USA. He was raised on farms in Olmsted and Dodge counties and is now a resident of Byron, Minnesota. He attended Byron High School and earned his B.S. in Engineering and M.S. in Physics from the University of Texas at Dallas.

Quam has had a diverse career, including serving as an engineer and a scientist. His commitment to public service is evident in his various roles. He was elected to the Byron School Board, served on the Zumbro Education District governing board, and chaired the Minnesota State Academic Science Standards writing committee. He has also served as a consultant on educational texts and a participant on several MCA committees.

In 2010, Quam was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives, representing District 24A, which includes the cities of Kasson and Byron, parts of Rochester, and parts of Dodge and Olmsted Counties. He assumed office on January 4, 2011, succeeding Randy Demmer. He has been reelected every two years since then.

During his tenure, Quam has served on various committees, including the Elections Finance and Policy, Health Finance and Policy, Human Services Finance, and Property Tax Division of the Taxes Committee. He has also served on the State Government Finance and Elections Committee, Government Operations Committee, and the Education Finance Committee, among others.

In October 2018, Quam made headlines when he snatched a microphone from the hand of his opponent, Jamie Mahlberg, during a debate. He later apologized for the incident. Despite the controversy, Quam was reelected with 53.6% of the vote.

Quam continues to serve the residents of District 24A, working diligently to represent their interests in the Minnesota House of Representatives.
