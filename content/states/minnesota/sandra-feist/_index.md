Sandra Feist is an American politician and a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL). She has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2021, representing District 41B in the northern Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the cities of Columbia Heights and New Brighton, and parts of Anoka, Hennepin, and Ramsey Counties.

Born and raised in Wisconsin, Feist attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, earning a B.A. in history and politics. After graduation, she moved to New Orleans, Louisiana to sing jazz. It was during this time that she began a career in immigration law, starting as a Case Manager for David Ware & Associates.

In 2005, while attending Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, Feist was displaced due to Hurricane Katrina. She traveled north to be with family in Minnesota. Feist transferred to William Mitchell College of Law, where she met her husband, Ben. Feist and her husband moved to New Brighton, where she opened a small firm specializing in immigration law in 2010.

Feist has held various leadership positions in the local American Immigration Lawyers Association chapter, including vice chair and chair. In that role, Feist expressed both praise of and disappointment with President Barack Obama's record on immigration reform. She advocated against country limits for employment-based green cards, calling them racist. Feist criticized President Donald Trump's immigration policy and the U.S. Senate's RAISE Act.

Feist was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2020 and reelected in 2022. She first ran after two-term DFL incumbent Mary Kunesh-Podein announced she would seek election to the Minnesota State Senate. Feist is the vice chair of the Public Safety Finance and Policy Committee and sits on the Economic Development Finance and Policy, Education Policy, and Judiciary Finance and Civil Law Committees.

Feist authored "The Veterans Restorative Justice Act" to expand access to Veterans Treatment courts in Minnesota. She proposed a bill that would expand state oversight of youth restorative justice programs, saying, "our focus has to be on prevention and intervention". Feist signed on to a letter written by Representative Ilhan Omar asking the Department of Justice to expand its investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department following the murder of George Floyd.
