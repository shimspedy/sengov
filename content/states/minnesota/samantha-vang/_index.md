Samantha Vang is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2019. She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 38B in the northwestern Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes parts of the cities of Brooklyn Center and Brooklyn Park in Hennepin County.

Vang was born and raised in north Minneapolis. Her parents are Hmong refugees from Thailand. She graduated from Robbinsdale Armstrong High School and from Gustavus Adolphus College, with a Bachelor of Science in political science and communications.

In 2018, Vang was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives, succeeding incumbent Debra Hilstrom. She has been reelected every two years since then. In 2021–22, Vang served as vice chair of the Agriculture Finance and Policy Committee, co-chaired the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus, and co-founded the Minnesota Asian Pacific Caucus.

Vang currently chairs the Agriculture Finance and Policy Committee, and sits on the Environment and Natural Resources Finance and Policy, Higher Education Finance and Policy, and Legacy Finance Committees. She has been vocal about the need to enforce the oversight ability of the Peace Officer Standards and Training Board in Minnesota, and the need to terminate the statute of limitations for civil suits against law enforcement.

Vang has introduced two bills into the legislature proposing an end to commercial turtle harvesting in Minnesota: one in 2019, which did not make it into the final 2019 Fish and Game bill in the Senate, and one in 2021. She also authored a bill in 2021 that would allow cities to impose bans on any pesticide the Minnesota Department of Agriculture designated as "pollinator-lethal".

In her electoral history, Vang has had significant victories. In the 2018 Minnesota State House - District 40B election, she received 72.76% of the votes. In the 2020 Minnesota State House - District 40B election, she received 62.79% of the votes.
