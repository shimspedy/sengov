Lisa Demuth, born on February 10, 1967, is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2019. She is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 13A in central Minnesota, which includes the cities of St. Joseph and Cold Spring, and parts of Stearns County.

Demuth was born in Paynesville, Minnesota. She graduated from Bloomington Kennedy High School. Alongside her political career, Demuth co-owns and manages commercial property with her husband, Nick.

Before her political career, Demuth was elected to the Rocori school board as a write-in candidate in 2007 and was reelected twice. She was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2018. During the 2020-2021 legislative session, Demuth served as an assistant minority leader in the House.

Demuth is pro-life and supported fetal heartbeat legislation in the Minnesota House. After the 2022 Minnesota House of Representatives Election saw Republicans fail to flip the House from Democratic control, Demuth was voted to serve as Minority Leader by her caucus. Demuth has portrayed herself as more collaborative and calm than her predecessor, Kurt Daudt.

Demuth, who is biracial, is the first African American and the first biracial person to serve as Minority Leader of the Minnesota House of Representatives and the House Republican caucus. According to Demuth, she asked fellow legislators to pick her based on her qualifications, not her race.

In her personal life, Demuth and her husband, Nick, reside in Cold Spring, Minnesota.
