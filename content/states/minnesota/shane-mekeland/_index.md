Shane Mekeland is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2019. He is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 15B in central Minnesota, which includes the city of Big Lake and parts of Sherburne County.

Born in 1969 or 1970, Mekeland has been self-employed for the bulk of his adult working years in two very different industries. He was a convenience store manager and owner for 20 years and is also a residential building general contractor. He has always followed current affairs, news (local, national & world) and more importantly politics.

Mekeland was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2018 and has been reelected every two years since. He first ran after three-term incumbent Jim Newberger announced he would not seek reelection in order to run in the 2018 U.S. Senate election. Mekeland serves on the Climate and Energy Finance and Policy and Labor and Industry Finance and Policy Committees.

In terms of political positions, Mekeland has called for an audit of the 2020 election. He has also signed on to a letter calling on Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to include Minnesota in his unsuccessful lawsuit to invalidate election results in other states, citing "illegal voting practices" in the state. In 2020, Mekeland wrote a letter to the Sherburne County Board of Commissioners asking it to designate the county a "Second Amendment sanctuary". He opposed bipartisan legislation to increase worker protection laws for meatpacking workers, saying that existing laws were adequate to deal with injuries and other issues and additional regulations would lead to increased consolidation.

Mekeland resides in Clear Lake, Minnesota, with his partner, Angela, and has one child. As a small business owner for much of his adult life, he came to a point to run for state office to have his and your voice heard, by getting the government out of so much of our lives. Now, it is time to run for re-election because there is more work to do. The never-ending rules and regulations put on us as citizens and our small businesses (including farmers) have to be pushed back and removed. As your Representative, he will continue to stand firm on the Constitution, strong principles, and simple common sense.
