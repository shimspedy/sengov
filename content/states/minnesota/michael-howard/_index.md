Michael Howard is a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, representing District 51A. He assumed office on January 3, 2023. His current term ends on January 7, 2025. Howard is a member of the Democratic Party.

Born in Becker, Minnesota, Howard lives in Richfield. He earned a B.A. in political science from Augsburg College in 2005. His career experience includes working as a communications specialist and communications director at the Minnesota House of Representatives, a public affairs manager for the Minnesota Department of Education, and a director of communications for the Minnesota Super Bowl Host committee. Howard was elected to the Richfield City Council in 2014.

In the 2023-2024 term, Howard was assigned to the following committees: House Housing Finance and Policy Committee (Chair), Rules and Legislative Administration Committee, House Taxes Committee, and Ways and Means Committee.

Howard ran for re-election to the Minnesota House of Representatives to represent District 51A and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. He defeated Ryan Wiskerchen with 74.2% of the votes.

Howard was raised in Becker, Minnesota. He attended Augsburg College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. During college, he was an intern for U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone's 2002 campaign. After graduating, Howard worked as a personal care assistant for children with autism. He worked on Mike Freeman's 2006 campaign for Hennepin County Attorney and was a legislative clerk in the Minnesota Senate. He worked as a communications specialist for the Minnesota House DFL Caucus from 2007 to 2011. After a brief period as a public affairs manager at the Minnesota Department of Education, Howard returned to the House Caucus to work as public affairs director. He was promoted to communications director in 2012 and worked in that position until 2016. In 2018, Howard was hired as the Host Committee spokesman for Super Bowl LII, held in Minneapolis.

Howard served on the Richfield city council from 2014 until 2018, while also working at the Minnesota House. On the city council, he supported a measure giving city employees paid parental leave and worked to increase affordable housing. When Richfield mayor Debbie Goettel stepped down to join the Hennepin County Board in 2016, Howard was named interim mayor until a special election was held. As interim mayor, he called for body cameras to be used by city police.

Howard was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2018 and has been reelected every two years since. He first ran after six-term DFL incumbent Linda Slocum announced she would not seek reelection. Howard had previously announced his intention to run for mayor of Richfield, but said he would run for the House seat vacated by Slocum, who endorsed him for the seat. Howard chairs the Housing Finance and Policy Committee, and sits on the Rules and Legislative Administration, Taxes, and Ways and Means Committees.
