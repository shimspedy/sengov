Warren E. Limmer, born on January 24, 1955, is a distinguished politician and a member of the Minnesota Senate. He is a part of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents the 34th District, which includes portions of Hennepin County in the northwestern Twin Cities metropolitan area.

Limmer was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, U.S. He attended North Hennepin Community College, where he received an A.A., and St. Cloud State University, where he received a B.A. in criminal justice studies. Before his political career, he worked as a corrections officer and was a member of the Hennepin County Corrections Advisory Commission and the Crystal Human Rights Commission. He now works as a real estate agent.

His political journey began in the Minnesota House of Representatives. He was first elected in 1988 in the old House District 48A, and reelected in 1990, 1992, and 1994. After the 1992 redistricting, the area became House District 33B.

Limmer's tenure in the Senate began with a special election in February 1995, held after Senator Patrick McGowan resigned upon being elected Hennepin County Sheriff. Since then, Limmer has been continuously reelected, even running unopposed in 2010. He served as an assistant minority leader from 2005 to 2006. His special legislative concerns include criminal justice, public education, safe school legislation, economic development, and tax reform.

In 2011, Limmer introduced a bill to propose a referendum on an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution banning same-sex marriage. The bill passed, but Minnesota voters rejected the amendment in the 2012 general election.

Limmer's contributions to the state of Minnesota are significant and his dedication to public service is commendable.
