Aaron Repinski is a dedicated public servant and a prominent figure in Minnesota politics. Born around 1972, he grew up in Winona, Minnesota, where he attended Cotter High School. He later pursued higher education at Winona State University, earning an associate's degree. Repinski's early career was marked by his commitment to public safety, serving as a firefighter in both Winona, Minnesota, and Fountain City, Wisconsin.

In 2020, Repinski entered the political arena by running for the at-large district of the Winona City Council. He successfully defeated the incumbent, Paul Schollmeier, by a significant margin, showcasing his ability to connect with the community and address their concerns. His tenure on the City Council was characterized by his dedication to improving local infrastructure and public services.

Repinski's political journey continued to gain momentum when he decided to run for the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2024. After 38 years in office, Gene Pelowski, the long-serving representative for Legislative District 26A, retired, creating an opportunity for Repinski to step in. He won the Republican primary against S. James Doerr and went on to secure victory in the general election, defeating Sarah Kreuger of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. This victory marked a significant swing in favor of the Republican Party in the district.

As a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, Repinski represents District 26A, which includes Winona County in southwestern Minnesota. He serves on several important committees, including Health Finance and Policy, Public Safety Finance and Policy, and the Veterans and Military Affairs Division. His legislative priorities focus on improving healthcare access, enhancing public safety, and supporting veterans and military families.

Outside of his political career, Repinski is a successful business owner. He operates Winona Tour Boat, a company that offers scenic cruises on the Mississippi River. Additionally, he is known for officiating weddings and performing hypnosis acts, showcasing his diverse talents and interests.

Repinski is a devoted family man, residing in Winona with his wife, Michelle. They are active members of the Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka, a minor basilica of the Roman Catholic Church. His strong ties to the community and unwavering commitment to public service have made him a respected and influential figure in Minnesota politics.
