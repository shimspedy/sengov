Born on December 28, 1979, Knudsen attended college at Minnesota State University, Mankato, earning a bachelor's degree in social work and alcohol and drug studies. Before her political career, she was a business owner and served on the Lake Shore City Council for eight years, even becoming mayor in 2020.

Knudsen was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022. She first ran after redistricting and after three-term Republican incumbent John Poston announced he would not seek reelection. In the House, Knudsen serves on the Education Finance and Education Policy Committees.

In the 2022 Minnesota State House - District 5A election, Knudsen secured a victory with 70.49% of the votes. Her personal life is centered in Lake Shore, Minnesota, where she lives with her husband, Kevin, and their four children.
