Brian Daniels (born October 2, 1958) is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2015. He is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota. Daniels represents District 19A, which is located south of the Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the city of Faribault and portions of Goodhue, Rice, and Waseca Counties.

Daniels studied at Northwest Technical College, where he earned a degree in small business management. His professional career outside of politics includes working as a warranty administrator.

In 2014, Daniels was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives. He managed to defeat the five-term DFL incumbent Patti Fritz. Since then, he has been reelected every two years.

During the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Daniels endorsed Senator Marco Rubio. In 2022, he endorsed former state representative Brad Finstad's campaign for Minnesota's 1st congressional district.

Daniels serves as the minority lead on the Children and Families Finance and Policy Committee. He also sits on the Labor and Industry Finance and Policy Committee. In addition, Daniels sits on the Regent Candidate Advisory Council, which oversees the nomination process to the University of Minnesota Board of Regents.

He has been critical of lobbying efforts by PACs on behalf of candidates. Daniels also signed on to a letter calling on the university to stop participating in research on "aborted human fetal organs". He authored bipartisan legislation to increase access to transportation and car payment help for low-income Minnesotans. However, he opposed efforts to raise the gas tax and increase license tab fees to pay for transportation funding.

On a personal note, Daniels is married to Elizabeth and they have four children. They reside in Faribault, Minnesota.
