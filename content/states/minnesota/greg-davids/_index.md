Gregory Michael Davids, born on August 28, 1958, is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2009, and previously from 1991 to 2006. He is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota. Davids represents District 26B in southeastern Minnesota, which includes the cities of La Crescent and Spring Valley, and parts of Fillmore, Houston, and Mower Counties.

Davids graduated from Spring Valley High School, then attended Waldorf College in Forest City, Iowa, and Winona State University in Winona, where he earned his B.S. in social science. He also attended graduate school at Mankato State University in Mankato.

Before his political career, Davids was appointed to the Preston City Council in 1986, and was elected mayor a year later, serving until his election to the state legislature in 1991. He was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in a special election on February 12, 1991. He won a full term in 1992 and was reelected every two years until 2006. Davids first ran after eight-term Republican incumbent Elton Redalen resigned to accept an appointment as Minnesota's Commissioner of Agriculture. In 2006, Davids was defeated by Ken Tschumper. Davids ran again and defeated Tschumper in 2008, and has been reelected every two years since then. He is the longest-serving Republican member of the Minnesota House, serving 16 non-consecutive terms.

Davids serves as the minority lead for the Taxes Committee, and sits on the Ethics and Higher Education Finance and Policy Committees. He chaired the Taxes Committee for six years of non-consecutive Republican control, from 2011 to 2012 and from 2015 to 2018. During the 2005-06 biennium, he chaired the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee. That session he also served as speaker pro tempore for the House, a position he also held during the 2011-12 biennium. From 1999 to 2004, Davids chaired the Commerce, Jobs and Economic Development Committee.

Davids has consistently advocated for tax cuts for businesses and individuals, and called for Minnesota to make its tax code more competitive with other Midwestern states. He has supported a full repeal of the tax on Social Security, and an end to the estate tax. From 2011 to 2012, Davids chaired the taxes committee during a budget stalemate between House and Senate Republicans and Governor Mark Dayton that resulted in a government shutdown.

Davids currently resides in Preston, Minnesota with his wife Bonnie and their three children. He is a business and farm owner.
