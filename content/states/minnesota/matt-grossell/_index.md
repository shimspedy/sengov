Matthew "Matt" Grossell (born October 15, 1965) is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2017. A member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, Grossell represents District 2A in northwestern Minnesota, which includes the city of Bemidji and parts of Beltrami, Clearwater, and Lake of the Woods Counties.

Early Life, Education, and Career:
Grossell attended Itasca Community College, graduating with an Associate of Arts degree, and Hibbing Community College, graduating with a law enforcement certificate. He is a retired Clearwater County sheriff's deputy, and was shot on the job a month into his time as an officer.

Minnesota House of Representatives:
Grossell was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2016 and has been reelected every two years since. He first ran after two-term Republican incumbent Dave Hancock did not seek reelection. Grossell serves on the Capital Investment, Judiciary Finance and Civil Law and Public Safety Finance and Policy Committees.

Public Safety and Policing:
Grossell authored legislation raising the penalty for attacking a police officer to a felony and prohibits local governments from disarming police. After the Minnesota Police and Peace Officer's Association testified in support of certain gun safety measures, Grossell said the organization had "allowed themselves to be politically motivated". During a press conference on crime in Minneapolis, Grossell got into an argument with Mayor Jacob Frey, the two accused each other of lying about Minneapolis' policing policy. After the murder of George Floyd, Grossell drew controversy by posting the death was "not about race".

Other Political Positions:
Grossell has supported Enbridge's plans to replace the Line 3 crude oil pipeline. He opposed legislation to extend drivers licences to all Minnesotans regardless of immigration status.

Arrests:
In May 2019, Grossell was arrested for illegal trespassing by St. Paul police. Police found him drunk after becoming unruly at a hotel bar near the Capitol, and took him to the hospital for evaluation. Once there, Grossell was cleared by staff but refused to leave, became argumentative, and was arrested. He released an apology, saying "I apologize to my family, my constituents, my colleagues, and my friends."

Personal Life:
Grossell was born on October 15, 1965 in Itasca County, Minnesota, U.S. He is a single father of three children and resides in Clearbrook, Minnesota, U.S.
