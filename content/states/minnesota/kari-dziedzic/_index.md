Kari Dziedzic, born in 1962, is an American politician and a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL). She represents District 60, which includes portions of the city of Minneapolis in Hennepin County. Her district is also notable for including part of the University of Minnesota.

Born and raised in Northeast Minneapolis, Kari Dziedzic has a strong connection to her community. Her father was a longtime public official, which likely influenced her decision to serve the public. She is a graduate of Edison High School in Minneapolis, and of the University of Minnesota, where she earned a mechanical engineering degree.

Dziedzic was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and has since dedicated herself to serving her constituents. In late 2022, she was chosen by her Minnesota Senate colleagues as majority leader. This marked a significant milestone in her political career.

However, Dziedzic's journey has not been without challenges. In November 2022, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Despite this, she continued to lead the Senate DFL caucus remotely while recovering from multiple procedures, including a hysterectomy and appendix and spleen removal. She returned to the Capitol just weeks before the end of the session in May.

In 2023, Dziedzic revealed that she had been diagnosed with cancer and underwent successful surgery. Despite her health challenges, she continued to lead the Senate DFL caucus and work for the people of her district and all Minnesotans through remote technology.

In early 2024, Dziedzic announced that she would be stepping down from her leadership position due to health concerns related to her cancer diagnosis. Despite stepping down, Dziedzic's dedication to her role and her constituents remains unwavering.

Throughout her career, Dziedzic has shown remarkable resilience and dedication to public service. Her journey serves as an inspiration to many and underscores the importance of commitment and perseverance in the face of adversity.
