Julie Greene is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives since January 14, 2025. She represents District 50A, which includes parts of Edina and Bloomington in Hennepin County, located in the southwestern Twin Cities metropolitan area. Greene is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL).

Born on February 16, 1972, Julie Greene was raised in Chicago, Illinois. She pursued higher education at the University of Dayton in Ohio, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications. After completing her education, Greene embarked on a career as a brand strategist, a role she held for 25 years. Her professional experience in communications and branding provided her with valuable skills that she would later bring to her political career.

In addition to her work as a brand strategist, Greene was actively involved in her local community. She served as the vice chair of the Edina School Board from 2020 to 2024, where she chaired committees on policy and legislative action. Her dedication to education and community service earned her recognition and respect among her peers and constituents.

In 2023, Heather Edelson, the incumbent representative for District 50A, resigned from the Minnesota House of Representatives after being elected to the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners. This created an opportunity for Greene to run for the open seat in the 2024 election. She announced her candidacy in December 2023 and quickly gained support within her party. After defeating Alicia Gibson for the endorsement at the district DFL convention, Greene became the sole DFL candidate to file for candidacy.

In the general election, Julie Greene faced Republican nominee Owen Michaelson. Greene's campaign focused on issues such as education, healthcare, and community development. Her message resonated with voters, and she won the election with 64.6% of the vote, securing her position as the representative for District 50A.

As a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, Greene has been assigned to several key committees, including Education Finance, Education Policy, and Transportation Finance and Policy. Her work in these committees reflects her commitment to improving the quality of education, enhancing transportation infrastructure, and addressing the needs of her constituents.

Julie Greene resides in Edina, Minnesota, with her husband, Jon, and their four children. Her family life and community involvement continue to be important aspects of her identity, and she remains dedicated to serving the people of her district with integrity and passion.
