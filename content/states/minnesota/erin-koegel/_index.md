Erin Koegel, born on April 6, 1982, is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2017. She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 39A in the northern Twin Cities metropolitan area. This includes the city of Fridley and parts of Anoka and Ramsey Counties.

Koegel was born in Duluth, Minnesota, and grew up in Maple Grove, Minnesota. She graduated from Osseo High School in 2000. She attended the University of Minnesota Duluth, graduating with a Bachelor of Applied Science in psychology and a minor in political science. She also holds a master's degree in advocacy and political leadership.

Koegel completed an internship with the Duluth City Council and worked as a page at the Minnesota House of Representatives. She works as a volunteer coordinator at Community Action Partnership of Ramsey County, and previously was executive director of the nonprofit Health Care for All.

Koegel was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2016 and has been reelected every two years since. She first ran after three-term DFL incumbent Jerry Newton announced he would run for a seat in the Minnesota State Senate. Koegel chairs the Sustainable Infrastructure Policy Committee and sits on the Commerce Finance and Policy and Transportation Finance and Policy Committees. From 2021 to 2022, she served as vice chair of the Transportation Finance and Policy Committee.

Koegel supports extending the eligibility of MinnesotaCare, a public health care program for low-income families. She also supports increasing investments in child care, preschool, and financial assistance for those attending college. Koegel has spoken publicly about the difficulties of being a parent to a newborn child while in the legislature, including the lack of maternity or parental leave. She authored legislation to increase consumer protections and place limits on settlement-payment deals, requiring judges to scrutinize the payments. Koegel was part of an advisory council looking at how to spend funding through Minnesota's opioid epidemic response law.

Koegel supported legislation to increase the state's gas tax to keep up with inflation and increase dedicated funding for roads and bridges. She lives in Spring Lake Park with her husband Steve, their daughter Clara, and their Labrador named Spud.
