Fue Lee is an Hmong-American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2016. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 59A, which includes parts of northern Minneapolis in Hennepin County, Minnesota.

Born on August 26, 1991, in a refugee camp in Thailand to Hmong parents from Laos, Lee came to Minnesota as a toddler in 1992. He lived in public housing with his parents and siblings. He graduated from Patrick Henry High School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and later from Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, with a bachelor's degree in political science and international relations.

Before his political career, Lee was an intern or volunteer for Minneapolis City Council Member Blong Yang, then-U.S. Representative Keith Ellison, and Steve Simon. He later became an aide in the office of the Minnesota Secretary of State. Lee co-founded the Asian American Organizing Project and Progressive Hmong American Organizers with former state Senator Mee Moua, DFL activist Yee Chang, and state representative Jay Xiong.

Lee was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2016 and has been reelected every two years since. He defeated 10-term incumbent Joe Mullery in a DFL primary after losing the party endorsement by one delegate. Lee is the first person of color and of Asian descent to represent his district, and was the first Hmong-American to represent Minneapolis in the state legislature. In 2018, he was an early endorser of Ilhan Omar for Minnesota's 5th congressional district.

Lee has served as chair of the Capital Investment Committee since 2021. He also sits on the Environment and Natural Resources Finance and Policy and Legacy Finance Committees. From 2019 to 2020, he served as vice chair of the Capital Investment Committee and as an assistant majority leader for the House DFL Caucus. Lee is a member of the People of Color and Indigenous (POCI) Caucus and the Minnesota Asian-Pacific (MAP) Caucus.

As chair of the Capital Investment Committee, Lee worked with Senator Tom Bakk on a $518 million public works package in 2021, highlighting investments into housing infrastructure and small business redevelopment after civil unrest and protests following the murder of George Floyd.
