Pete Johnson is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, representing District 8A. Born and raised in Two Harbors, Minnesota, Pete has always been deeply connected to his community. He graduated from Two Harbors High School in 1997 and went on to attend St. Cloud State University, where he studied sports science. During his time at St. Cloud, Pete worked nights and weekends in the emergency room at St. Cloud Hospital, gaining valuable experience in the field of public safety.

In 2002, Pete began his career as a firefighter, initially working for a fire department in Lakewood, Colorado. In 2005, he returned to Minnesota and joined the Duluth Fire Department, where he has served with distinction ever since. Pete's commitment to public safety and his community has been a driving force throughout his career.

In 2024, Pete decided to run for office to succeed outgoing representative Liz Olson, who declined to seek reelection. During his campaign, Pete emphasized his experience as a firefighter and his dedication to public service. He won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor primary with an overwhelming 82% of the vote and went on to defeat the Republican nominee, Mark McGrew, in the general election by a significant margin.

Pete took office on January 14, 2025, and quickly became an active and influential member of the Minnesota House of Representatives. He serves on several key committees, including Education Finance, Workforce, Labor, and Economic Development Finance and Policy, and Public Safety Finance and Policy. Pete's legislative priorities include improving public safety, supporting education, and promoting economic development in his district.

Outside of his work in the legislature, Pete is a devoted husband and father. He and his wife, Dehlia Seim, reside in Duluth with their two daughters, Berit and Ellis. Pete is also an active member of his community, coaching girls' lacrosse at his children's school during the spring and summer.

Pete Johnson's dedication to public service, his extensive experience in public safety, and his commitment to his community make him a valuable asset to the Minnesota House of Representatives and the people of District 8A.
