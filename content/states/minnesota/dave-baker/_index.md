Baker co-authored legislation that would require doctors to check up on patients before prescribing opioid painkillers. In 2018, Baker worked on the "Opioid Epidemic Response Law" with DFL State Senator Chris Eaton, who also lost a child to opioids. Baker carried legislation in 2017 that imposed a "penny a pill" or "stewardship fee" on opioid manufacturers.
