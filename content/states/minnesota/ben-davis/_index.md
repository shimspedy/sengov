Davis represents District 6A in northern Minnesota, which includes the city of Grand Rapids and parts of Cass, Crow Wing, and Itasca Counties.

In the Minnesota House of Representatives, Davis was elected in 2022. He first ran in an open seat after redistricting and the retirement of three-term Republican incumbent John Poston. Davis was among those supporting for an audit of 2020 election results in Crow Wing County, saying he wanted to make sure the laws were followed and no fraud occurred.

Davis serves on the Children and Families Finance and Policy, Climate and Energy Finance and Policy, and Elections Finance and Policy Committees. In the 2022 Minnesota State House - District 6A election, Davis secured 13,657 votes, accounting for 62.30% of the total votes.

Personal Life

Davis lives in Merrifield, Minnesota, with his wife, Dawn, and their six children. He is a pastor at Remnant Ministry Center, a nondenominational church in Brainerd, Minnesota.

Future Plans

Davis is running for re-election to the Minnesota House of Representatives to represent District 6A. He declared candidacy for the Republican primary scheduled on August 13, 2024.
