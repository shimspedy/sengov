She also helped raise awareness and funds in the aftermath of massive earthquakes in 2020 and Hurricane Fiona in 2022.

Pérez-Vega is also a rapper and signer and has been active in the Twin Cities hip hop scene since she was a teenager. She owns the record company SotaRico, whose name honors her Minnesotan and Puerto Rican roots. In 2018, Pérez-Vega performed at the 32nd annual Governor's Council Martin Luther King Jr. Day Celebration at the State Capitol and the Minnesota Women's March.

Pérez-Vega was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022. She first ran after legislative redistricting and the retirement of 16-term DFL incumbent Carlos Mariani. Pérez-Vega serves on the Children and Families Finance and Policy, Education Finance, and Housing Finance and Policy Committees.
