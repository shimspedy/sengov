Jamie Long (born December 19, 1981) is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2019. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 61B, which includes parts of southern Minneapolis in Hennepin County, Minnesota.

Long was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2018 and has been reelected every two years since. He first ran after eight-term incumbent Paul Thissen announced he would not seek reelection in order to run for governor of Minnesota. From 2021 to 2022, Long chaired the Climate and Energy Finance and Policy Committee.

Since 2023, Long has served as the Majority Leader of the Minnesota House of Representatives. As majority leader, Long has listed investments in affordable housing, child care, and climate change among his caucus's top priorities for the 2023 legislative session. He spoke in support of high-profile bills to protect abortion rights, provide driver's licenses to undocumented residents, make Minnesota a refuge state for transgender people, and provide funding to the attorney general to hire more prosecutors.

Long attended Carleton College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 2004, and George Washington University, graduating with a Juris Doctor in 2007. Long has worked as an environmental attorney, an energy and transportation aide in the United States Congress and worked for Sheldon Whitehouse and Diana DeGette. Long previously worked as former U.S. Representative Keith Ellison's deputy chief of staff and legislative director. He managed Ellison's 2017 campaign for Democratic National Committee chair. He was chair of the Linden Hills Neighborhood Council and a board member of Minneapolis Climate Action.

Long is married to Melissa and they have two children. They reside in Minneapolis.
