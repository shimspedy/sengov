Andrew Myers is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. He is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 45A in the western Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the cities of Mound, Minnetrista, and Orono and parts of Hennepin County.

Andrew Myers was born in Rochester, Illinois. He attended Bradley University, earning a bachelor's degree in business. He further pursued his education at the University of Montana, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree.

Before his political career, Myers was a business owner and president of a law firm. He also has experience in sales, consulting, and business management. He has lived in Minnesota for over 16 years and served on the Minnetonka Beach City Council and Planning Commission. He also served on the Tonka Bay Parks and Docks Commission before his election to the legislature.

In 2021, Myers supported Jennifer Carnahan in her reelection campaign for state Republican Party chair. He was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022. He first ran in 2020 against one-term DFL incumbent Kelly Morrison and lost. In 2022, Myers ran for an open seat after legislative redistricting and after Morrison announced she would seek election to the Minnesota Senate.

In the House, Myers serves on the Capital Investment, Housing Finance and Policy, and Labor and Industry Finance and Policy Committees. He has expressed his political positions on several occasions. In 2020, Myers said closing "so-called tax loopholes" would only solve a fraction of the state's budget problem and that he would eliminate wasteful spending and oppose raising taxes on businesses. In 2023, he opposed a quarter-cent sales tax that would raise funds for affordable housing in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, calling it "a little ridiculous".

Myers lives in Tonka Bay, Minnesota with his wife, Amanda, and has four children.
