Liz Olson is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2017. She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL). Currently, Olson represents District 8A in northeastern Minnesota, which includes parts of the city of Duluth in St. Louis County.

Born in 1980 or 1981, Olson attended the University of Minnesota Duluth, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology and women's studies. She also attended Luther Seminary, graduating with a Master of Arts in congregational and community care.

Olson is a community organizer who has worked for Churches United in Ministry, Generations Health Care Initiatives, and TakeAction Minnesota. She is a former president of the League of Women Voters, Duluth, is a member of the advisory committee of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits northeast chapter, and is a board member of Firefly Yoga International.

Olson was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2016 and has been reelected every two years since. She first ran after two-term DFL incumbent Erik Simonson announced he would seek election to the Minnesota Senate. In 2020, her opponent contested the election results, but a court dismissed the case.

Olson served as speaker pro tempore of the House from 2019 to 2022. From 2019 to 2020 she served as the majority whip for the House DFL Caucus, and from 2021 to 2022 as a deputy majority leader. Olson chairs the Ways and Means Committee and also sits on the Rules and Legislative Administration and Taxes Committees.

In her electoral history, Olson has consistently won with a significant majority. For instance, in the 2022 general election for Minnesota House of Representatives District 8A, Olson defeated her opponent with 70.5% of the votes.
