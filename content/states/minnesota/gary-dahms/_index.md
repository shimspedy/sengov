Gary H. Dahms was born on January 14, 1947, in Clements, Minnesota. He graduated from Redwood Falls High School and went on to attend the University of Minnesota, where he earned a B.S. degree in agricultural business administration. He is also a graduate of the Blandin Community Leadership Program.

Dahms owned and operated Dahms Insurance Agency for 25 years, demonstrating his entrepreneurial spirit. He has also served as a Redwood County Commissioner and was a board member of several organizations including the Redwood County Soil and Water Conservation District, the Redwood County Agricultural Society, the Redwood Area Development Corporation, the Redwood County Economic Development Association, the Southwest Minnesota Regional Development Commission, the Minnesota Valley Rail Authority, and the Redwoodâ€“Renville Health Services Board.

In 2010, Dahms was first elected to the Minnesota Senate, succeeding retiring longtime Senator Dennis Frederickson of New Ulm. He was reelected in 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2022, showing his continued commitment to public service. As a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, he represents District 16, which includes all or portions of Brown, Lac qui Parle, Lyon, Redwood, Renville, and Yellow Medicine counties in the southwestern part of the state.

During his tenure, Dahms has been known for his stance on various issues. For instance, in April 2015, he voted against the Sunday liquor sales bill, which would have repealed the long-standing ban on Sunday liquor sales in Minnesota. His opposition to breweries and distilleries is well-documented. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dahms, the Chair of the Commerce Committee, was implicated by a number of his colleagues as one of the main roadblocks to a bill that would have allowed Minnesota craft breweries to sell package sizes other than 750ml and 64oz to their patrons.

Despite the challenges and controversies, Dahms continues to serve his constituents with dedication and integrity. His journey from a small-town business owner to a state senator is a testament to his commitment to public service and the people of Minnesota.
