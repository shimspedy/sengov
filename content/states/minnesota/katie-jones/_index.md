Katie Jones is an American politician and engineer who currently serves as the representative for District 61A in the Minnesota House of Representatives. She assumed office on January 14, 2025, succeeding Frank Hornstein. Jones is a member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL).

Born in Lebanon, Indiana, Katie Jones grew up in a rural setting before pursuing higher education at Purdue University, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering. After completing her studies, she moved to Minnesota to work with Habitat for Humanity in Rochester. Eventually, she relocated to Minneapolis, where she became deeply involved in community and environmental initiatives.

Before embarking on her political career, Jones worked as a lobbyist and policy writer with the Center for Energy and Environment (CEE). She also contributed to the Sustainability Office with the City of Minneapolis. Her dedication to community service extended to her role as a member and president of the Lowry Hill East Neighborhood Association. Additionally, she served on the City of Minneapolis Capital and Long-Range Improvement Committee and was appointed to Governor Tim Walz's Sustainable Transportation Advisory Council.

In 2021, Jones ran for a seat on the Minneapolis City Council, representing Ward 10, which includes the neighborhoods of Whittier, South Uptown, and the Wedge. Although she was eliminated in the third round of ranked-choice voting, her campaign highlighted her commitment to climate policy and community engagement.

In February 2024, Representative Frank Hornstein announced his decision not to seek re-election after 22 years of service. Jones launched her campaign for the District 61A seat on March 6, 2024, emerging as a strong contender in a crowded field of DFL candidates. Despite facing online threats from right-wing extremists, Jones secured the endorsement of Rep. Hornstein shortly before the primary election. Her focus on climate policy and her experience in the district positioned her as a natural successor to Hornstein.

Jones won the general election on November 5, 2024, defeating her opponent Toya LÃ³pez with 83.9% of the vote. Her victory marked the beginning of her tenure in the Minnesota House of Representatives, where she continues to advocate for environmental sustainability, community development, and progressive policies.

Throughout her career, Katie Jones has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to public service and environmental advocacy. Her work in the Minnesota House of Representatives reflects her dedication to creating a more sustainable and equitable future for her constituents and the broader community.
