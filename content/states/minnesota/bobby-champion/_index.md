Bobby Joe Champion, born on December 17, 1963, is an American attorney and politician. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents the 59th district, which includes portions of downtown and north Minneapolis in Hennepin County.

Champion was born in Minneapolis and graduated from Minneapolis North High School. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Macalester College and a Juris Doctor from the William Mitchell College of Law.

Before his political career, Champion worked as an assistant Minnesota attorney general under Skip Humphrey and Mike Hatch, and as an attorney for a legal rights center. He also worked with Flyte Tyme Productions and was co-founder and director of the Grammy-nominated Excelsior Choir. He was executive director of the Midwest chapter of the National Association of Minority Contractors and program director for Social Spaces with Stairstep Initiative.

Champion was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2008, unseating first-term incumbent Augustine Dominguez. He was reelected in 2010. In November 2012, Champion was elected to the Minnesota Senate, defeating Republican Jim Lilly by a margin of 82%–18%. Champion was reelected to the Minnesota Senate in 2016, defeating challenger Jennifer Carnahan. Champion was also re-elected in 2020 and 2022.

In 2022, he was chosen to serve as president of the Senate by his caucus; he is expected to be formally elected when the Senate meets in January 2023. As of now, he is the incumbent President of the Minnesota Senate.
