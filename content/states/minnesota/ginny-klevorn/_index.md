Ginny Klevorn

Ginny Klevorn, born in 1959, is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2019. She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 42B in the western Twin Cities metropolitan area, which includes the city of Plymouth and parts of Hennepin County.

Early Life, Education, and Career

Klevorn's family has lived in Belgium and Brazil. In Brazil, she volunteered for Catholic relief agencies in the slums of cities. Klevorn attended Saint Louis University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in business administration. She is a professional mediator. Klevorn served on the Minnesota Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board and the Wayzata School District Legislative Action Committee. She was a guardian ad litem in the 4th Judicial District juvenile court.

Minnesota House of Representatives

Klevorn was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2018 and has been reelected every two years since. She first ran in 2016, losing to five-term Republican incumbent Sarah Anderson. She challenged Anderson again in 2018 and won, in a race that generated the most outside spending that year.

Klevorn chairs the State and Local Government Finance and Policy Committee and sits on the Commerce Finance and Policy, Ethics, Higher Education Finance and Policy, and Ways and Means Committees. From 2019 to 2020, she served as vice chair of the State Government Finance Committee, and from 2021 to 2022 she was vice chair of the Redistricting Committee.

Klevorn authored legislation to form a citizen advisory redistricting commission to draw legislative boundaries, rather than relying on the courts as Minnesota had in multiple redistricting cycles. In 2022, she sponsored a bill to ban political parties from setting up exclusive political clubs for lobbyists to access politicians after the Senate Republican Campaign fund made a request for such a club at the state legislature. She has spoken out against the payday loan industry's predatory practices. Klevorn wrote a bill to prohibit evictions from assisted-living homes during public health emergencies like COVID-19. When Sanford Health and Fairview announced an intention to merge, Klevorn questioned the move and advocated for additional financial transparency from the companies.

Personal Life

Ginny and her spouse Tom have been married for 42 years. They have three adult children who are Wayzata High School and University of Minnesota graduates. After living and working in Brussels, Belgium and São Paulo, Brazil, Ginny & Tom returned to Minnesota in 2002. They have been active members of the Plymouth community ever since.
