Doron Clark, born on December 31, 1977, is an American politician and a member of the Minnesota Senate. He represents District 60, which includes parts of Northeast and Southeast Minneapolis in Hennepin County and part of the University of Minnesota. Clark is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL).

Clark grew up on a sheep farm near Eyota, Minnesota. He attended Hamline University, where he graduated with degrees in religion and economics in 2000. Before his election to the Minnesota Senate, Clark worked in the ethics department at Medtronic and served a two-year term as chair of the Senate District 60 DFL in 2022.

In 2009, Clark began a campaign to represent Ward 1 in the Minneapolis City Council but dropped out before candidate filing. His political career took a significant turn when he was elected in a special election on January 28, 2025. On January 14, he won the DFL primary in a crowded field with 38% of the vote. Two weeks later, he defeated Republican nominee Abigail Wolters in the general election with 91% of the vote. Clark succeeded former Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Kari Dziedzic, who died of ovarian cancer on December 27, 2024. His election returned control of the Minnesota Senate to the DFL with a one-seat majority; the session began with the DFL and the Republican Party tied at 33 seats each. On February 3, 2025, Clark was sworn in, and the Senate reorganized under DFL leadership. He started the session on the Education Finance, Higher Education, Judiciary and Public Safety, and Housing and Homelessness Prevention Committees.

Clark lives in Minneapolis with his wife, Molly, and their two daughters. He is a long-distance runner who has competed in multiple marathons and coaches cross country at Yinghua Academy. Clark is known for his dedication to public service and his commitment to improving education and addressing housing issues in his district. He has campaigned on the need to more fully fund education, starting with how school lunches are funded, and has emphasized the urgency of addressing the housing emergency in his district, including the presence of encampments.

Clark's election to the Minnesota Senate marked a significant milestone in his political career, and he continues to work towards fulfilling the legacy of his predecessor, Kari Dziedzic. His dedication to public service and his commitment to his constituents make him a respected and influential figure in Minnesota politics.
