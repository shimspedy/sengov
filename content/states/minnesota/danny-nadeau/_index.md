Danny Nadeau (born May 15, 1965) is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. A member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, Nadeau represents District 34A in the northwest Twin Cities metropolitan area, which includes the cities of Champlin and Rogers and parts of Hennepin and Wright Counties.

Early Life, Education, and Career:
A native of Medina, Minnesota, Nadeau has lived in Rogers for over two decades. He worked as Hassan Township administrator and served on the township's park board. In 2008, Nadeau worked at the Minnesota House of Representatives in the House Republican Research department. From 2009 to 2010, he worked as a program manager at the State Energy Office at the Minnesota Department of Commerce.

Political Career:
In 2016, while Nadeau was deputy chair of Minnesota's 3rd Congressional District Republican executive committee, the group decided not to endorse Donald Trump for president, which Nadeau said "was a hard decision" but was made to help down-ballot candidates. Nadeau worked as chief of staff to Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson for his 12 years on the county board, and worked on Johnson's 2014 and 2018 gubernatorial campaigns. When Johnson announced he would not run for reelection, Nadeau ran for the seat, gaining the endorsement of Johnson and the Star Tribune Editorial Board. He lost to technical architect Kevin Anderson.

Minnesota House of Representatives:
Nadeau was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022. He first ran for an open seat created by legislative redistricting. Nadeau serves on the Health Finance and Policy and State and Local Government Finance and Policy Committees.

Policy Positions:
Nadeau is anti-abortion and opposed the removal of the two-parent notification requirement for Minnesotans under 18 seeking abortion access. He opposed increasing funding to the Minnesota Attorney General 's office to hire more criminal prosecutors, saying he would rather move attorneys in the consumer protection department. Nadeau voted against legislation ensuring workers would earn one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, saying it was a burden on small businesses.
