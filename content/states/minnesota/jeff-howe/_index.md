Jeff Howe, born on June 15, 1959, is an American politician and a member of the Minnesota Senate. He represents District 13 in central Minnesota as a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota. Before his tenure in the Senate, he served as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, representing District 13A.

Howe was born and raised in Morris, Minnesota. He grew up on a farm near Chokio, Minnesota, and completed his high school education at Chokio-Alberta High School. After high school, he attended St. Cloud State University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree.

His career in public service began with the United States Armed Forces. He served for 38 years, initially in the Navy and later in the Minnesota Army National Guard. He retired in 2017 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. His dedication to service continued as he became a member of the Rockville city council and later transitioned into a consultant role.

Howe's political career started when he was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2012. He was re-elected in 2014 and 2016. In 2018, he decided not to seek re-election to the House and instead ran for a seat in the Minnesota Senate. He won the election and has been serving as a Senator since then.

On a personal note, Howe is married to Sheri Howe and they have four children. They reside in Rockville, Minnesota. His brother, John Howe, is also a former Minnesota state senator. Howe is a practicing Lutheran.

Throughout his career, Howe has demonstrated a commitment to public service and leadership. His experiences in the military, local government, and state legislature have shaped his approach to governance and public policy.
