Kaohly Vang Her is a Hmong-American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2019. She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 64A, which includes parts of Saint Paul in Ramsey County, Minnesota.

Born in Laos, her family came to the United States as refugees when she was four years old. She grew up in Appleton, Wisconsin, a paper town where her father worked at the local paper factory and her mother as a teacher’s aide. As their family expanded, her parents worked multiple jobs to make ends meet. There were periods of her life where her family struggled financially but her parents never gave up on the dream of what America could provide.

As early as she can remember, her parents would say to her that the way out of poverty is through education. Her mother emphasized independence and her father on self-reliance. Her father said that there is no greater return in life than that which you receive from investing in your education. Her parents were right.

She graduated from the University of Wisconsin Madison with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance, she has a Master of Business Administration from Northeastern University, and she is currently pursuing her Doctorate from the University of St. Thomas in Education Leadership.

Her educational attainment led her to work in and hold leadership positions in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors. She has been blessed to have a broad depth of experience and skills. She is the mother of two beautiful and intelligent young women, the wife of a strong feminist man, the daughter of survivors of oppression and war, and a child of a community that decided she was worth investing in.

She believes that it is her turn to take all of that love, wisdom, and strength to pour back into her neighbors, her community, her city, and her state. She has been serving her home for 16 years. This area is where she organized for access to equitable education, advocated for affordable healthcare, and where she fought for criminal justice reform.

She authored the End Child Marriage Bill, which raised Minnesota's legal marriage age to 18 without exceptions. Previous law allowed 16- and 17-year olds to wed with permission of parents and judicial approval, often as a result of forced marriages.
