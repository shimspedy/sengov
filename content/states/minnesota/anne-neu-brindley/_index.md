Anne E. Neu Brindley is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2017. She is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 28B in east-central Minnesota, which includes the cities of Wyoming, Chisago, and North Branch, as well as parts of Chisago County.

Early Life and Education:
Neu Brindley received her bachelor's degree in family studies from Brigham Young University. She resides in North Branch, Minnesota, and has previously served on the North Branch Planning Commission.

Career:
Before her election to the state legislature, Neu Brindley worked as a Republican political strategist. She was Chip Cravaack's campaign manager during his successful bid for Minnesota's 8th congressional district in 2010. The campaign unseated longtime Democrat Jim Oberstar and gave the 8th district of Minnesota its first Republican representative in 77 years. She also recruited Pete Hegseth to run for the Republican nomination for the 2012 U.S. Senate election in Minnesota. She worked as the executive director of the Minnesota House Republican Campaign Committee and helped recruit women candidates to run for legislative office.

Minnesota House of Representatives:
Neu Brindley was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in a special election on February 14, 2017. She won a full term in 2018 and has been reelected every two years since. Neu Brindley first ran after the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that three-term Republican incumbent Bob Barrett was ineligible to run because he did not meet residency requirements, triggering a special election.

Neu Brindley serves as the minority lead on the Human Services Finance Committee and also sits on the Health Finance and Policy and Commerce Finance and Policy Committees. She served as deputy minority leader from 2019 to 2022 after being appointed by minority leader Kurt Daudt. Neu Brindley has announced she will not run for reelection in 2024.

Political Positions:
Neu Brindley has said she supports lower taxes, opposes abortion, and supports wider access to public funding for private and charter schools. She has consistently called for money from the state's budget surplus to be used for tax relief and to cut state taxes on Social Security income.
