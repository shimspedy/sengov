James "Jimmy" Gordon, born in 1987 in Cambridge, Minnesota, is an American politician currently serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives. A member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, Gordon represents District 28A, which includes parts of North Branch, Cambridge, and Isanti in southeastern Minnesota. He has been serving in this role since January 14, 2025.

Before his tenure in the Minnesota House of Representatives, Gordon served as the mayor of Isanti, Minnesota. He was elected mayor in 2022 with 55% of the vote, defeating the incumbent Jeff Johnson. During his time as mayor, Gordon focused on improving local infrastructure, supporting small businesses, and enhancing community services. His leadership and dedication to the community earned him widespread recognition and support.

In January 2024, Gordon announced his intention to challenge incumbent Republican Brian Johnson in the primary for District 28A of the Minnesota House of Representatives. Despite facing criticism for past tax delinquency during the primary campaign, he won the Republican endorsement and defeated Johnson in the primary with 65.99% of the vote. Gordon was the only challenger to successfully primary an incumbent in Minnesota in 2024. In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee Tim Dummer by nearly 37 points, securing his position in the Minnesota House of Representatives.

As a legislator, Gordon is committed to addressing key issues such as education, healthcare, and economic development. He serves on several committees, including Education Policy, Elections Finance and Government Operations, and Human Services Finance and Policy. His work in these committees focuses on creating policies that benefit his constituents and improve the overall quality of life in his district.

Gordon's dedication to public service extends beyond his political career. He is a business owner and has been actively involved in the Isanti Fire Department since 2018. His commitment to his community is evident in his various roles and responsibilities, both as a public servant and a private citizen.

On a personal note, Gordon lives in Isanti with his wife, Megan, and their four children. They attend North Isanti Baptist Church, where they are actively involved in church activities and community outreach programs. Gordon's strong family values and deep-rooted connection to his community have been significant factors in his political success and continued support from his constituents.

Representative Jimmy Gordon's journey from a small-town mayor to a state legislator is a testament to his dedication, hard work, and unwavering commitment to serving the people of Minnesota. His leadership and vision continue to shape the future of his district and the state as a whole.
