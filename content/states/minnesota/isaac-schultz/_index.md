Isaac Schultz is a member of the Republican Party and currently serves in the Minnesota House of Representatives, representing District 10B. He assumed office on January 3, 2023, and his current term ends on January 7, 2025.

Schultz ran for election to the Minnesota House of Representatives to represent District 10B and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. He was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022, running for an open seat created by legislative redistricting and the retirement of 10-term Republican incumbent Sondra Erickson.

Born and raised on his familyâ€™s farm in Upsala, Schultz learned the dignity of hard work from a young age. This upbringing motivates him to serve with integrity, humility, and respect. He earned a B.S. in marketing from the University of Northwestern in 2013.

Before his political career, Schultz worked as an auctioneer with Schultz Auctioneers Landmark Realty and Kurt Johnson Auctioneering, Inc. He also served as the district director for Congressman Pete Stauber. Schultz served as the president of the Minnesota State Auctioneers Association and has been affiliated with the National Auctioneers Association, Sons of the American Legion, the Boys and Girls Club, National Rifle Association, and Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus.

In his role as a legislator, Schultz has been assigned to several committees including the Environment and Natural Resources Finance and Policy Committee, Labor, Industry, Veterans and Military Affairs Finance and Policy Committee, and the Sustainable Infrastructure Policy Committee.

In the general election for Minnesota House of Representatives District 10B, Schultz defeated Hunter Froelich, securing 78.6% of the votes. He is married and resides in Elmdale Township.
