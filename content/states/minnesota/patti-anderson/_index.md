Patricia "Patti" Anderson was born on June 4, 1966. She is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. She is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 33A in the northeastern Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the cities of Forest Lake, Hugo, and Mahtomedi and parts of Washington County.

Anderson served one term as the State Auditor of Minnesota, from 2003 to 2007, and ran unsuccessfully in 2006 and 2010. She is the most recent Republican to hold that office. She was also the mayor of Eagan, Minnesota, and a national committeewoman for Minnesota to the Republican National Committee.

In terms of her early life and education, Anderson graduated from Forest Lake Area High School and received a Bachelor of Arts in international relations and political economy from the University of Minnesota. She earned a Master of Arts in public administration from Hamline University.

Anderson served as a city council member of Eagan, Minnesota, from 1991 to 1998, and as mayor from 1998 to 2002. In 2002, City Pages named her the state's best mayor. From 2008 to 2009, Anderson served as president of the Minnesota Free Market Institute, a right-wing think tank.

Anderson was elected State Auditor of Minnesota on November 5, 2002. She ran after two-term DFL incumbent Judi Dutcher announced she would not seek reelection, running unsuccessfully for governor of Minnesota. Anderson defeated DFL nominee State Treasurer Carol Johnson and Independence Party nominee Dave Hutcheson. During her term as auditor, Governor Pawlenty called for cuts across the state budget, and Anderson cut staff, earning a reputation as a "taxpayer watchdog".

On a personal note, Anderson is married to Doug and they have six children. They reside in Dellwood, Minnesota. In addition to her political career, Anderson is also a business owner.
