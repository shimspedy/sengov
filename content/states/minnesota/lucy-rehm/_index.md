Lucy Rehm is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 48B in the western Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the cities of Chanhassen and Chaska and parts of Carver County.

Lucy Rehm was born and raised in Minnesota. She received her bachelor's degree in English from the College of St. Benedict and attended the University of Minnesota, studying Japanese and ESL. She has also studied French at the College International De Cannes, and Japanese at the Sapporo Institute of Language.

Before her election to the legislature, Rehm served on the Chanhassen City Council and the Chanhassen Environmental Commission. She was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022, defeating two-term Republican incumbent Greg Boe.

In the House, Rehm serves on several committees, including the Agriculture Finance and Policy, Climate and Energy Finance and Policy, Education Finance, and Sustainable Infrastructure Policy Committees.

Rehm has been active in policy making. She authored legislation included in the 2023 transportation budget that created an e-bike rebate program. She also sponsored a bill that designated a seven-mile stretch of highway in Chanhassen the "Prince Rogers Nelson Memorial Highway". This bill passed the House with unanimous support on April 21, 2023, the anniversary of Prince's death. The highway runs past Paisley Park, Prince's home and recording studio. The bill was supported by members of Prince's family and covered the cost of four purple signs placed along the route.

In the 2022 Minnesota State House - District 48B election, Lucy Rehm received 10,632 votes, accounting for 50.97% of the total votes. Her opponent, Republican Greg Boe (incumbent), received 10,215 votes, accounting for 48.97% of the total votes.

Lucy Rehm lives in Chanhassen, Minnesota, with her spouse, Phil, and their three children.
