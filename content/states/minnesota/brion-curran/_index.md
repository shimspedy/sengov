Brion Curran is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. A member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), Curran represents District 36B in the north Twin Cities metropolitan area, which includes the cities of White Bear Lake and Vadnais Heights and parts of Ramsey and Washington Counties.

Early Life, Education, and Career:
Curran graduated from Centennial High School in Circle Pines, Minnesota. They earned an associate of applied sciences degree in law enforcement from Century College and a Bachelor of Science in criminal justice from Concordia University, St. Paul. Curran has worked in disability services for 20 years. They joined the White Bear Lake Police Department, serving as a volunteer police sergeant and as a 911 dispatcher from 2015 to 2018. Curran served as a deputy in the Chisago County Sheriff's Office in 2018 before retiring after developing PTSD after responding to a traumatic incident.

Minnesota House of Representatives:
Curran was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022. They first ran after two-term DFL incumbent Ami Wazlawik announced she would not seek reelection. Curran serves as vice chair of the Sustainable Infrastructure Policy Committee, and sits on the Human Services Policy, Judiciary Finance and Civil Law, and Public Safety Finance and Policy Committees. Curran is the vice chair of the Queer Caucus, a group of LGBTQ+ legislators that formed during the 2023 legislative session.

Political Positions:
Curran supported legislation to ban the use of conversion therapy for minors and vulnerable adults in Minnesota, which passed the House in 2023. They have called the practice "abusive brainwashing", and spoke on the House floor about their experience with it, arguing that it does more harm than good. A former deputy sheriff, Curran left the force in 2018 due to PTSD and has advocated for more mental health support funding for officers. They authored a bill that would prohibit courts from issuing or approving no-knock search warrants, saying it puts citizens and law enforcement at risk and violates the Fourth Amendment protection from unlawful searches and seizures.
