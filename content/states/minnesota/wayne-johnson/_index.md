Wayne Johnson is an American politician and member of the Minnesota House of Representatives. A member of the Republican Party, he represents district 41A in the eastern Twin Cities metropolitan area, which includes the cities of Cottage Grove and Lake Elmo and other parts of Washington County.

Johnson has been working as a business owner for over two decades, running two HVAC companies in Minnesota. He began his political career at a local level. In 2016, he was elected to the Cottage Grove City Council, where he served for two years; he then ran for Washington County Commissioner and won the seat in 2018. He served 4 years in the commissioner role. Johnson has also served on multiple boards and commissions, including the Cottage Grove Planning Commission.

After Republican incumbent Mark Wiens declared he was not seeking re-election to Minnesota House district 41A, two candidates emerged for the Republican primary: Wayne Johnson and Grayson McNew. McNew, backed by the Action 4 Liberty PAC, won endorsement at the Republican convention, but the more moderate Johnson defeated McNew in the Republican primary. In the general election, Johnson narrowly defeated DFL challenger Lucia Wroblewski, holding the seat by a margin of 1.09 points.

Johnson lives in Cottage Grove, Minnesota with his wife MaryBeth. He has two adult children. He earned an associate degree in accounting from Iowa Lakes Community College and a bachelor's degree in accounting from Metropolitan State University. His career experience includes working as an accountant and owning two HVAC businesses.
