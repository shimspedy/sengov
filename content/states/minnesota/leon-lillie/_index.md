Leon Michael Lillie, born in June 1961, is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2005. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 44B in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the cities of Oakdale, North St. Paul, and Maplewood and parts of Ramsey and Washington Counties.

Early Life, Education, and Career:
Lillie graduated from North High School in North Saint Paul, then attended the University of Nottingham in Nottingham, England, and Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, earning his B.S. in political science. Lillie served on the North Saint Paul City Council from 1995 to 2004, and unsuccessfully ran for Ramsey County Commissioner. When elected, he worked as a baggage handler and ramp agent for Northwest Airlines.

Minnesota House of Representatives:
Lillie was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2004 and has been reelected every two years since. He defeated two-term DFL incumbent Scott Wasiluk in a DFL primary after Wasiluk was caught on video drinking alcohol in his Capitol office. Since 2019, Lillie has chaired the Legacy Finance Division, which oversees the allocation of proceeds from a state sales tax increase passed in 2008. Those funds are designated to protect drinking water and wildlife habitat and to preserve arts and cultural heritage. Lillie also sits on the Capital Investment, Rules and Legislative Administration, and Ways and Means Committees. He served as vice chair of the Commerce and Labor Committee from 2009 to 2010 and as an assistant majority leader for the House DFL caucus from 2013 to 2014.

Legacy Amendment Funds:
Lillie has served on the Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Council, which makes recommendations to the legislature on how Legacy Funds should be spent. In 2022, he authored legislation to spend $159 million from the Legacy Fund to restore and enhance natural areas. Lillie called the bill, which was the result of negotiations with the Republican Senate, "a little bit disappointing" and called for further investments in subsequent years.

Labor and Union Contracts:
Lillie was a member of the Subcommittee on Employee Relations. In 2012, he criticized Republican members who voted to reject contracts for state employees containing a two percent pay raise. In 2017, he voted to accept union contracts with MAPE and AFSCME, but was outvoted by Republicans.
