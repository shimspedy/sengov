Career:
Mike Freiberg is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2013. He represents District 43B in the central Twin Cities metropolitan area, which includes the cities of Golden Valley and Robbinsdale and parts of Hennepin County.

Freiberg was raised in Golden Valley, Minnesota. He earned his degrees from Georgetown University and the William Mitchell College of Law. He served as a legislative aide to U.S. Representative Jim Oberstar from 1999 to 2001. From 2005 to 2006, he was a committee administrator for the Minnesota Senate. He was elected to the Golden Valley City Council in 2007 and served until his election to the state legislature.

Freiberg has worked as an adjunct professor for William Mitchell College of Law. He is an attorney for the Public Health Law Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

In the Minnesota House of Representatives, Freiberg was elected in 2012, and has been reelected every two years since. He first ran for an open seat created by legislative redistricting. In 2018, Freiberg endorsed fellow state representatives Erin Murphy in the DFL gubernatorial primary and Ilhan Omar for Minnesota's 5th congressional district.

Freiberg chairs the Elections Finance and Policy Committee and sits on the Commerce Finance and Policy, State and Local Government Finance and Policy, and Ways and Means Committees. He was an assistant minority leader from 2017 to 2018. From 2019 to 2020 Freiberg chaired the Government Operations Committee, and from 2021 to 2022 he chaired the Preventative Health Division of the Health Finance and Policy Committee.

Freiberg sponsored legislation for Minnesota to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, under which it would award its electoral votes to whichever presidential candidate wins the most popular votes nationwide; the compact goes into effect only when states that together have a majority of electoral votes have joined it. He has argued that the Electoral College has "become less and less representative".
