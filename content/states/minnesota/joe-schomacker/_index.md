Joseph "Joe" Roy Schomacker was born on March 25, 1986, in Luverne, Minnesota. He is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2011. A member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, Schomacker represents District 21A in the southwestern corner of the state, which includes the cities of Luverne and Pipestone and parts of Cottonwood, Lincoln, Murray, Nobles, Pipestone, and Rock Counties.

Schomacker graduated from Luverne Senior High School in Luverne and from Southwest Minnesota State University in Marshall, earning his B.A. in public administration, speech communication and political science in 2008. He served as the university's student body president in 2007-08. In 2010, he earned his M.P.S. online from George Washington University. He is an independent public relations consultant.

Schomacker was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2010 and has been reelected every two years since. In 2010, he defeated former representative and DFL House Majority Leader Ted Winter for the seat being vacated by incumbent Doug Magnus, who opted to run for an open Minnesota Senate seat.

Schomacker served as an assistant minority leader during the 2013-14 legislative session. In 2015-16 he chaired the Aging & Long-Term Care Policy Committee, and in 2017-18 he chaired the Health & Human Services Reform Committee. Schomacker is the minority lead on the Health Finance and Policy Committee and sits on the Economic Development Finance and Policy and Ways and Means Committees.

His career experience includes working as a senior partner with Schomackers Home Galleries, the director of resource development of The Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Society, and an admissions clerk with Sanford Health.
