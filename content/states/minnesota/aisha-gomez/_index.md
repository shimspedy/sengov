Aisha Gomez, born on July 22, 1981, is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2019. She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 62A, which includes parts of Minneapolis in Hennepin County, Minnesota.

Gomez graduated from South High School in Minneapolis and attended the University of Minnesota, graduating with a B.S. in environmental science. Before running for political office, Gomez worked with the Women's Environmental Institute for more than a decade and was a senior policy aide to Minneapolis City Council member Alondra Cano.

Gomez was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2018 and has been reelected every two years since. She first ran after four-term incumbent Susan Allen announced she would not seek reelection. Gomez chairs the Taxes Committee, and sits on the Property Tax Division and Ways and Means Committee. From 2021 to 2022, she chaired the Preventing Homelessness Division of the Housing Finance and Policy Committee.

Gomez, who is of Latino, Arab, and Jewish heritage, is a member of the House People of Color and Indigenous (POCI) Caucus. At the start of the 2023 legislative session, Gomez authored a tax conformity bill that was the first bill to pass the House floor. It received unanimous bipartisan support in both chambers. Gomez supported a 2021 tax bill compromise that included funding to address youth homelessness across the state. She supports legalizing marijuana and has advocated for low taxes in order to "bring people out of the illicit market and into a regulated market".

Gomez represents the area of Minneapolis where the police murder of George Floyd took place. After Floyd was killed, she released a statement saying: "This is why we talk about police abolition. There is no reform that can fix this system". Gomez authored legislation requiring departments of over 50 officers to institute civilian oversight boards to improve accountability. She has been critical of the Minneapolis police, especially their use of chemical agent sprays on crowds, introducing legislation to ban the use of irritants and nonlethal ammunition, calling them "cruel and escalatory".
