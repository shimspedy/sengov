Samakab Hussein

Born on October 12, 1980, in Somalia, Samakab Hussein is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 65A in the Twin Cities, which includes parts of the city of Saint Paul in Ramsey County.

Early Life, Education, and Career

Hussein moved to the United States from Somalia when he was 14 years old. He pursued his bachelor's degree in business and accounting from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, and later earned a M.A.P.L. in advocacy and political leadership from Metropolitan State University in 2023.

In 2015, Hussein challenged Ward 1 Saint Paul city councilor Dai Thao but was unsuccessful. Despite the setback, Hussein's campaign manager called the claims "absolutely baseless". The DFL endorsing convention lasted 10 hours and ended with no endorsement after neither candidate reached the 60% delegate threshold.

In 2016, Hussein was a delegate for Hillary Clinton in Minnesota's delegation to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. The Minnesota delegation had the largest number of Muslim and Somali delegates at the convention.

Minnesota House of Representatives

Hussein was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022. He first ran after redistricting and after six-term DFL incumbent Rena Moran announced she would run for Ramsey County Commissioner. He is the first Somali-American to represent St. Paul in the Minnesota Legislature.

Hussein is vice chair of the Legacy Finance Committee and serves on the Capital Investment, Housing Finance and Policy, and Labor and Industry Finance and Policy Committees.

Political Positions

Hussein supported legislation that would have guaranteed rideshare drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft wage increases, employment protections, and better insurance coverage. The bill passed both chambers of the legislature, but was vetoed by Governor Tim Walz on May 25, 2023.

Personal Life

Hussein is married and has two children. He resides in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He is a small business owner by profession.
