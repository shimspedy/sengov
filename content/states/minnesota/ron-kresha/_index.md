Ron Kresha was born on December 16, 1969. He completed his B.A. in English from St. Cloud State University and later pursued an M.B.A. in finance/accounting from Bellevue University. He is currently serving as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives and has been in office since 2013. He represents District 10A in north-central Minnesota, which includes the city of Little Falls and parts of Aitkin, Crow Wing, Kanabec, Mille Lacs and Morrison Counties.

Kresha is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota. He was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2012 and has been reelected every two years since. He first ran for an open seat following legislative redistricting. He served as the minority lead on the Education Finance Committee and also sits on the Ways and Means Committee. He served as an assistant majority leader from 2015 to 2016 and as majority whip for the Republican House caucus from 2017 to 2018.

In terms of education policies, Kresha supported bipartisan legislation to expand early learning scholarships for disadvantaged children and supported a bill to target preschool funding to low-income families. He opposed legislation that would create a Department of Early Childhood. He called for focusing on improving math and literacy scores before legislators "throw money" at the public school system. He criticized the Walz administration's handling of grant oversight after the Feeding our Future investigation uncovered one of the largest federal fraud cases in state history. He opposed language requiring comprehensive sex education in elementary and secondary schools.

Kresha is married to Wendy and they have five children. They reside in Little Falls, Minnesota.
