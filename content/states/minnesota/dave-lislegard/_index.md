Dave Lislegard

Born on March 6, 1973, Dave Lislegard is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2019. He is a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 7B in northeast Minnesota, which includes the city of Virginia and parts of St. Louis County in the Iron Range.

Early Life and Education

Lislegard attended Babbitt-Embarrass High School. He studied at Mesabi Range College for two years and later attended the University of Minnesota Duluth, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in political science and communications.

Career

Lislegard worked as a steelworker at the LTV steel plant in Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota, until he was laid off in 2001. He then worked in business relations for Lakehead Constructors. Lislegard served on the Aurora City Council for 14 years and as mayor from 2017 until he was elected to the state legislature. As a council member and mayor, Lislegard long supported the mining industry in the Iron Range, saying he was confident mining could be done responsibly despite environmental concerns.

Minnesota House of Representatives

Lislegard was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2018 and has been reelected every two years since. He first ran after three-term DFL incumbent Jason Metsa announced they would not seek reelection and would run for Minnesota's 8th Congressional District. Lislegard defeated the party-endorsed candidate, Shaun Hainey, in the DFL primary. Lislegard chairs the Property Tax Division and sits on the Taxes, Environment and Natural Resources, and Veterans and Military Affairs Committees. From 2019 to 2022 he served as vice chair of the Taxes Committee.

Mining and Environmental Regulations

Lislegard is a vocal supporter of the mining industry in the Iron Range, and has been called "arguably the most pro-mining legislator" in the state. He co-authored legislation to officially declare Minnesota a "mining-friendly" state. He has supported the PolyMet and Twin Metals mining proposals, and criticized Mesabi Metallics for failing to meet state deadlines for its taconite mining project.

Personal Life

Lislegard is married to Lisa and they have two children. They reside in Aurora, Minnesota.
