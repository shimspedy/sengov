Nathan Wesenberg is an American politician and wildlife biologist serving as a member of the Minnesota Senate for the 10th district. He was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 3, 2023.

Before entering politics, Wesenberg served as a wildlife biologist for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. He was also a conservative activist in Morrison County, Minnesota. During his campaign, Wesenberg was supported by Action 4 Liberty, a Libertarian-leaning activist organization.

Wesenberg was elected to the Minnesota Senate in November 2022 and assumed office on January 3, 2023. Shortly after being elected to the Minnesota Senate in January 2020, Wesenberg spoke at an anti COVID vaccine rally at the state Capitol. Wesenberg suggested that Governor Tim Walz should be jailed for his response to the pandemic and he described COVID-19 vaccines a “death shot”. Wesenberg told the audience that his wife recently left a job as a doctor because her employer didn't like that she was writing exemptions for masks and vaccines.

Wesenberg was born in and lives in Little Falls, Minnesota. He is married and has three children. His wife, Jenny, was a doctor who left her job due to disagreements with her employer over mask and vaccine exemptions.
