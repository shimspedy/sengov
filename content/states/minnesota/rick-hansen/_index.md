Rick Hansen was born on March 1, 1963, in Albert Lea, Minnesota. He was raised on a family farm in rural Freeborn County, Minnesota. After graduating from Freeborn High School in 1981, he attended Upper Iowa University and graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology in 1985. He furthered his education by receiving a Master of Science degree in Soil Management from Iowa State University in December of 1987.

Rick began his professional career at the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) in January of 1988. He worked on a pesticide use survey and helped develop a pilot project for empty pesticide container recycling. In 1991, Rick became a Supervisor in the MDAâ€™s pesticide applicator certification and training program. In this role, he worked with continuing education programs to train pesticide applicators in Minnesota. He was a national leader in pesticide certification issues.

In 1996, Rick was elected to the Dakota County Soil & Water Conservation District (SWCD) Board. He represented District 1, in northern Dakota County. He was re-elected in 2002. He served for 5 years as Chair of the Dakota County SWCD and in leadership positions in state and local associations.

Hansen serves as chair of the Environment and Natural Resources Finance and Policy Committee, and is a member on the Capital Investment Committee, the Agriculture Finance and Policy Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee. Hansen is co-chair of the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources and is currently a vice chair and current member of the Legislative Audit Commission.

Outside the legislature, Rick Hansen is President of Harmony Cedar, Inc, a small business specializing in sales of Amish furniture and gifts, and owns a family farm in southern Minnesota. His wife Suzanne works as the Sustainability Coordinator for Allina Health; their son Evan attends 12th grade at South St Paul Secondary School in South St. Paul and runs cross-country.
