Alicia Kozlowski is an American politician serving as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), and represents District 8B in northeastern Minnesota, which includes the city of Duluth and parts of St. Louis County.

Born on January 12, 1988, in Duluth, Minnesota, Kozlowski is the child of a Mexican union electrician father and a Fond du Lac Band Ojibwe mother. They were raised by their grandmother and adopted in adulthood by a native family. Their adoptive father, Ray "Skip" Sandman, was an Anishinaabe spiritual leader and ran twice for Minnesota's 8th Congressional District.

Kozlowski is a first-generation college graduate, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of Minnesota Duluth in 2009 and a Master of Business Administration from the College of St. Scholastica in 2017.

From 2019 to 2021, Kozlowski worked as a community relations officer for the City of Duluth and Mayor Emily Larson, where they advocated to remove the word "chief" from city job titles and helped create a Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two Spirit People Reward Fund, the first in Minnesota.

Kozlowski was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in November 2022. They first ran after four-term DFL incumbent Jennifer Schultz announced she would not seek reelection and would run for the 8th Congressional District. Kozlowski defeated Duluth City Council president Arik Forsman in the DFL primary.

When they took office, Kozlowski became the first nonbinary and first two-spirit member of the Minnesota Legislature and the first Mexican and first Ojibwe person to represent Duluth. Kozlowski serves on the Capital Investment, Economic Development Finance and Policy, Housing Finance and Policy, and Labor and Industry Finance and Policy Committees. They are the vice chair of the House People of Color and Indigenous (POCI) Caucus and a member of the legislator's first Queer Caucus, made up of LGBTQ+ members.

Kozlowski was highlighted as part of Minnesota Public Radio's 2023 "Changemakers" series, which showcases Minnesotans from diverse backgrounds making an impact in the state.
