Josiah Hill, born on December 15, 1976, is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 33B in the eastern Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the cities of Stillwater, Forest Lake, and Bayport, and parts of Washington County.

Hill grew up in Stillwater, Minnesota. He pursued his education at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, where he earned a bachelor's degree in English. He furthered his studies at Hamline University, where he obtained a Master of Science in education for English/language arts and a doctorate in education.

Before his political career, Hill was an English teacher at Stillwater Area High School and served as the president of the St. Croix Education Association since 2010. His dedication to education and his community led him to run for a position in the Minnesota House of Representatives.

In 2022, Hill ran for the Minnesota Senate but lost to two-term Republican incumbent Karin Housley. However, he did not let this setback deter him. In the same year, he ran for the House and won after the retirement of two-term DFL incumbent Shelly Christensen.

As a representative, Hill serves as the vice chair of the Education Policy Committee. He also sits on the Labor and Industry Finance and Policy and Education Finance Committees. His political platform is focused on environmental protection, more funding for schools, expanding healthcare, and racial equity. In 2023, he authored legislation that would help a power plant in Oak Park Heights decommission its coal power plant as a part of Xcel Energy's plan to move toward renewable energy sources.

On a personal note, Hill lives in Stillwater, Minnesota, with his wife, Emily, and their three children. His life is a testament to his commitment to his community, education, and public service.
