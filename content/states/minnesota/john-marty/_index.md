John J. Marty (born November 1, 1956) is a member of the Minnesota Senate, representing District 40, which includes parts of Ramsey County in the northern Twin Cities metropolitan area. As a young state senator, he ran for governor of Minnesota in 1994.

Personal Details:
Born: November 1, 1956

Political party: Democratic (DFL)
Spouse: Connie Jaarsma
Alma mater: St. Olaf College (BA)

John Marty was born in Evanston, Illinois, on November 1, 1956. He is the son of author and theologian Martin E. Marty. He attended St. Olaf College, graduating with a BA in ethics in 1978. In 1979 and 1980 he worked in the DFL Party as a campaign aide and communications director. He became an administrator and researcher for the Criminal Justice Committee of the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1980, before working as a grant administrator at the Lutheran Brotherhood Foundation for two years beginning in 1985.

After his election to the Minnesota Senate in 1986, Marty became a member of the board of directors of the National Youth Leadership Council. From 1993 to 1996, he served on the board of Goodwill/Easter Seals Minnesota, a local nonprofit organization.

Marty was elected state senator from District 63 on November 4, 1986, and sworn in on January 6, 1987, for the 75th legislative session. The 1992 legislative redistricting, in conjunction with the U.S. census, changed Marty's district from 63 to 54. On November 7, 2006, Marty was reelected to a sixth term, winning 62% of the vote and carrying each of the seven suburbs in his district. The 2012 legislative redistricting changed Marty's district from 54 to 66.

In 1994, Marty sought to unseat incumbent Republican Governor Arne Carlson. He was the DFL nominee, winning its primary by two percentage points over former state commerce commissioner and future Attorney General Mike Hatch (the other candidates were Richard T. Van Bergen and former Minneapolis Police Chief Tony Bouza).
