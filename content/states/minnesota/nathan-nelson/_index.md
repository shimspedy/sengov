Nathan Nelson is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2019. He is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 11B in east-central Minnesota. This district includes the cities of Mora, Rush City, and Hinckley, and parts of Chisago, Kanabec, and Pine Counties.

Nelson was born on January 17, 1979, in Hinckley, Minnesota, and grew up on a dairy farm. After graduating from Hinckley-Finlayson High School in 1997, he continued the family tradition and became a third-generation dairy farmer. Before his political career, Nelson served on the Clover Township Board of Supervisors for nine years and was the president of the Pine County Farm Bureau.

His political journey began with a special election on March 19, 2019, when he was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives. This opportunity arose after three-term Republican incumbent Jason Rarick resigned to run for a seat in the Minnesota Senate. Nelson won a full term in November 2020 and was reelected in 2022.

In the House, Nelson serves on several committees, including the Agriculture Finance and Policy, Children and Families Finance and Policy, and the Workforce Development Finance and Policy Committees. He has been vocal about issues affecting his constituents, such as advocating for a wolf hunt, which he believes is a problem for farmers and ranchers in rural Minnesota.

On the personal front, Nelson lives in Hinckley with his spouse, Suzanna. They have five children. Despite his busy political career, Nelson remains connected to his roots and continues to work as a farmer.
