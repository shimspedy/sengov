Nolan West is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2017. He is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 37B in the northern Twin Cities metropolitan area, which includes the city of Blaine and parts of Anoka County.

West was born on September 30, 1990, and was raised in Blaine, Minnesota. He attended Meadow Creek Christian School in Andover, which changed its name to Legacy Christian Academy the year after he graduated. He later attended the University of Minnesota and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in history with a minor in political science.

Before his political career, West worked as a legislative assistant for the Republican caucus in the Minnesota House of Representatives for almost two years. He resigned from this position in September 2016 following reports of several racist posts he had made on Facebook.

In 2016, West was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives after incumbent Tim Sanders retired. He has been reelected every two years since then. In the House, West serves as an assistant minority leader and sits on the Capital Investment, Education Finance, and Transportation Finance and Policy Committees.

During his first session, the 90th legislative session (2017–18), West was the chief author of 30 bills, most notably those addressing one of the main infrastructure issues of his district, Highway 65. However, none of the bills that West authored made it through committee.

In his second session, the 91st legislative session (2019–20), West was the chief author of nine bills, most notably those addressing Highway 65 and the intersection of 109th Ave. Only one bill, HF3285, made it through committee during this session.

West lives in Blaine, Minnesota. Apart from his political career, West owns Best in the West Media and has worked as a videographer, a committee legislative assistant with the Minnesota GOP House Caucus, and a major sales associate with Costco Wholesale.
