Birthplace: Ely, Minnesota, U.S.
Education: North Dakota State University (Bachelor's degree in Construction Management)
Occupation: Business owner, Legislator
Political Party: Republican Party of Minnesota
Residence: Ely, Minnesota, U.S.

Early Life and Education:
Born and raised in Ely, Minnesota, Skraba graduated from Ely Memorial High School. He furthered his education at North Dakota State University, earning a bachelor's degree in construction management.

Military Service:
Skraba served in the United States Army for nine years, attaining the rank of Sergeant.

Political Career:
Skraba's political career began with his service on the St. Louis County Board of Adjustment and Planning Commission. He was a member of the Ely City Council and was elected mayor of Ely four times, most recently in 2021.

Skraba was initially a member of the DFL before joining the Republican Party of Minnesota. He endorsed candidate Jeff Anderson in the 2012 DFL primary to challenge Chip Cravaack for Minnesota's 8th Congressional District. After Anderson lost the primary to Rick Nolan, Skraba endorsed Cravaack.

Minnesota House of Representatives:
Skraba was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022. He first ran for the state House in 2002 as the Independence Party nominee, finishing third behind Republican Tom Porter and Democrat David Dill. He ran again in a 2015 special election after Dill died, and lost to DFL nominee Rob Ecklund.

Skraba defeated Ecklund in 2022 by 0.07 percent, triggering an automatic recount under state law, after which Skraba was declared the winner by 15 votes. Skraba serves on the Capital Investment, Environment and Natural Resources Finance and Policy, and Legacy Finance Committees.

Political Positions:
In 2010, Skraba, a longtime supporter of the mining industry, urged then-Governor Mark Dayton to pick department heads sympathetic to mining projects. He has criticized environmentalists in the DFL party, saying that northern Minnesota has been hampered by onerous permitting processes for mining. Skraba opposed the Biden administration's decision to cancel leases for Twin Metals copper-nickel mine in the region. Skraba, who has worked as a canoe guide, has supported northern Minnesota's tourism industry but said it "does not produce all the money Ely needs to function".
