Drew Roach is an American politician who represents the 58B district of the Minnesota House of Representatives. Born on January 29, 1985, Roach attended the Minnesota School of Business. He is a member of the Republican Party and assumed office on January 7, 2025, succeeding Pat Garofalo.

Roach's political career began with his victory in the November 2024 general election, where he defeated Ian English, securing 59 percent of the votes. His election marked a significant milestone in his career, as he took on the responsibility of representing his constituents in the Minnesota House of Representatives.

Throughout his career, Roach has been involved in various controversies. In August 2022, he attempted to serve court papers to then-Rosemount City Council member Tammy Block, leading to an altercation with Block's son, Daniel Tesch. The incident resulted in charges of disorderly conduct and brawling for all parties involved. Roach refused to take a plea deal, claiming the charges were politically motivated.

In January 2025, Roach made headlines again when he criticized Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon for adjourning a House session due to a lack of quorum. Roach accused Simon of presiding over a "sham" and argued that he should not have the gavel. This incident highlighted Roach's willingness to challenge authority and stand up for his beliefs.

Roach's legislative priorities include education policy, elections, finance and government operations, and taxes. As a business owner, he brings a unique perspective to his role in the House, advocating for policies that support small businesses and economic growth.

Despite the controversies, Roach remains committed to serving his constituents and making a positive impact in his community. His dedication to public service and his willingness to stand up for his beliefs have earned him both supporters and critics, but he continues to work tirelessly to represent the interests of the 58B district.
