Peggy S. Scott
Born: December 1961

Peggy S. Scott is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2009. She is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 31B in the northern Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the cities of Andover and East Bethel and parts of Anoka and Isanti Counties.

Education and Career
Scott graduated from Lowthian College, now called the Art Institutes International, in Minneapolis, in 1983, majoring in fashion merchandising. In addition to owning and operating a real estate investment company with her husband, she has been active in her community, serving on the Andover Parks and Recreation Commission, and coaching youth soccer and basketball. She is involved with the women's and youth ministry programs at her church and has served as an after-school care coordinator at the congregation's school.

Political Career
Scott was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2008 after incumbent Chris DeLaForest opted not to seek reelection, and has been reelected every two years since. During the 2011-12 legislative session, Scott chaired the Data Practices Subcommittee of the Civil Law Committee. In 2013-14, she served as an assistant minority leader. From 2014 to 2018 Scott chaired the Civil Law and Data Practices Committee. She serves as the minority lead on the Judiciary Finance and Civil Law Committee and again as an assistant minority leader.

In December 2021, Scott and 37 other Republicans signed a letter in opposition to the Mayo Clinic for its vaccine mandate policy for employees, calling for a halt in state funding for health care facilities that fire employees "due to unrealistic vaccine mandate policies".

Electoral History
Scott has had a successful electoral history. She won the 2008 Minnesota State House - District 49A with 59.34% of the votes. She was reelected in 2010 with 69.11% of the votes. In 2012, she won the Minnesota State House - District 35B with 59.09% of the votes.
