Jon Koznick

Born on July 4, 1972, Jon Koznick is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2015. He is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 58A in the southern Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the city of Lakeville and parts of Dakota and Scott Counties.

Early Life and Education:
Jon Koznick was born in Colombia. After the death of his mother, he was placed in an orphanage at the age of five. He was adopted soon after and was brought to the United States. Koznick attended St. Cloud State University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in marketing. He moved to Lakeville, Minnesota in 2001.

Political Career:
Koznick was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2014 and has been reelected every two years since. He first ran after eight-term Republican incumbent Mary Liz Holberg announced she would not seek reelection. When elected, he was one of the first two Latino Republicans to serve in the Minnesota Legislature along with Eric Lucero. During the 2016 Republican Presidential Primary, Koznick joined two dozen state lawmakers in endorsing Florida Senator Marco Rubio. He supported Tim Pawlenty during his 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary campaign.

Committee Assignments:
Koznick serves as the minority lead on the Economic Development Finance and Policy Committee and sits on the State and Local Government Finance and Policy and Taxes Committees. From 2019 to 2020 he served as an assistant minority leader for the House Republican Caucus.

Transportation:
Koznick has opposed legislation to raise the state's gas tax. He sponsored legislation that would disband the Counties Transit Improvement Board, a public body that pools resources to pay for transit lines, a proposal opposed by Governor Mark Dayton. Koznick authored a bill that would close the Northstar Commuter Rail line, which runs from Big Lake to Minneapolis, citing low ridership numbers. He opposed funding for predevelopment of a land bridge over the I-94 highway in Saint Paul. Koznick signed on to a letter calling for reforms to the Metropolitan Council, a regional planning agency, and criticizing their handling of the Southwest light rail project. He served on a committee on the Metropolitan Council's Structure and Service, and called for more accountability for the council. He briefly served as chair of the Legislative Commission on Metropolitan Government, and later resigned after a procedural fight between DFL and Republican members of the commission.

Personal Life:
Jon Koznick is married to Patty and they have two children. He is a business owner and real estate legislator.
