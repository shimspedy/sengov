Patricia Mueller is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2021. She is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 23B in southwestern Minnesota. This district includes the city of Austin and parts of Freeborn, Mower, and Steele Counties.

Born on March 28, 1981, in Oakdale, Minnesota, Mueller graduated from Tartan Senior High School. She pursued her higher education at Winona State University, where she earned her B.S. in English education in 2003. Later, she enrolled at Minnesota State University Moorhead, where she earned an M.S. in curriculum instruction in 2018 and an Ed. D. in 2022.

After graduating, Mueller worked as a teacher. In 2007, she and her husband moved to rural China to teach English as part of a mission trip. Mueller cites her time abroad as part of her inspiration to become active in politics. In 2015, Mueller moved to Austin, Minnesota, where she taught at Austin High School.

Mueller was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2020 and was reelected in 2022. She defeated eight-term DFL incumbent Jeanne Poppe after being recruited by local members of the Republican Party to run for the seat. In 2022, Mueller defeated former Austin mayor and police officer Tom Stiehm in a race that attracted considerable state media attention. Mueller serves on the Education Policy and Public Safety Finance and Policy Committees.

Mueller has called herself a "constitutional conservative with some libertarian leanings". She has stressed the importance of considering the needs of rural Minnesota. Mueller has said that Donald Trump made "it okay to be a conservative again". Mueller has touted her endorsements from the NRA and the Minnesota Police and Peace Officer's Association (MPPOA). Mueller signed a letter condemning violence after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, but also said that "we will never know" whether Joe Biden is "the real president". Mueller opposes using state funds for abortion and supports a ban on all abortions after 12 weeks unless the mother's life is in danger. She supports a constitutional amendment to remove state protections for abortion access.
