Sydney Jordan Biography

Sydney Jordan, born on October 1, 1990, is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2020. She is a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 60A, which includes parts of Minneapolis in Hennepin County.

Early Life and Education

Jordan was born in Illinois and attended the University of Minnesota, graduating with a B.A. in political science and global studies in 2013. She grew up in a working-class community along the shores of the Mississippi River near East Moline, Illinois. She is the daughter of public employees. Her mother is an educator and former teachers union president, and her father is a biologist for the Army Corps of Engineers.

Career

Before her political career, Jordan worked for the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers and was the political director for Jacob Frey's first mayoral campaign. She is also the state director of Save the Boundary Waters. She advocated against Voter ID requirements during a proposed constitutional amendment campaign.

Minnesota House of Representatives

Jordan was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in a special election on February 4, 2020. She won a full term in November 2020 and was reelected in 2022. Jordan first ran after the death of eight-term DFL incumbent Diane Loeffler, winning the primary election over 10 other candidates. She was endorsed by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

Jordan serves as vice chair of the Environment and Natural Resources Finance and Policy Committee, and also sits on the Education Finance, Labor and Industry Finance and Policy, and Rules and Legislative Administration Committees. She is also an assistant majority leader for the House DFL caucus. From 2021 to 2022, Jordan served as the vice chair of the Legacy Finance Committee, which oversees the allocation of proceeds from a state sales tax increase passed by amendment in 2008.

Education Initiatives

Jordan authored legislation to provide free breakfast and lunch to all students in Minnesota K-12 schools, which passed the House in February 2023. The bill passed the Senate, and was signed into law by Governor Tim Walz on March 17, 2023. Jordan also carried a bill that would require school districts have a comprehensive sexual health education program in elementary and secondary grades.

Public Safety and Police Reform

Jordan supported voting "yes" on City Question 2, which would have renamed the Minneapolis Police Department the Minneapolis Department of Public Safety, removed minimum staffing levels for sworn officers, and shifted oversight of the new agency from the mayor's office to the city council.
