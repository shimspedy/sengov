Shane Hudella is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. He is a member of the Minnesota Republican Party and represents District 41B in the southeast Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the cities of Hastings and Cottage Grove and parts of Dakota and Washington Counties.

Hudella was born and raised in Hastings, Minnesota. After graduating from Hastings High School, he attended the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 1988, Hudella joined the Minnesota Army National Guard, where he served until 2012. During his time in the National Guard, he was deployed in Operation Desert Storm in Iraq and reached the rank of First Sergeant.

In addition to his military service, Hudella is also known for his philanthropic efforts. He founded the organization "United League Heroes", which helps children of military families play hockey. He also built a Heroes Monument in Hastings, recognizing over 4,000 Minnesota service members.

Hudella was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022. He first ran after redistricting and after three-term Republican incumbent Tony Jurgens announced he would run for a seat in the Minnesota Senate. In the House, Hudella serves on the Education Finance, Transportation Finance and Policy, and Veterans and Military Affairs Finance and Policy Committees.

In terms of political positions, Hudella has opposed DFL legislation that would raise taxes in the state, specifically speaking against a bill increasing the sales tax in the Twin Cities metropolitan area to pay for transit.

On a personal note, Hudella lives in Hastings, Minnesota, with his wife, Jessica, and they have four children.
