Harry Niska is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. He is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 31A in the north Twin Cities metropolitan area, which includes the cities of Ramsey and Andover in Anoka County, Minnesota.

Early Life and Education:
Harry Niska grew up in Andover, Minnesota, and graduated from Anoka High School. He received his bachelor's degree in political science from Concordia College, Moorhead, and his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Minnesota Law School.

Legal Experience:
Niska worked as a law clerk on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals for Judge Roger Leland Wollman from 2005 to 2006, and for Judge David Stras in 2018. He also served on the Ramsey County Charter Commission. He worked at law firm Ross & Orenstein, and unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Ramsey City Council in 2010. In 2015, Niska brought a complaint against a Republican activist who he claimed misled voters by making false claims of endorsement in a judicial race for the Minnesota Supreme Court. The claim was upheld and the activist was fined $600.

Political Career:
In 2016, Niska opposed Donald Trump in the Republican primary. He signed up to volunteer for independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin, saying that he believed that Trump had "abused every lever of power thatâ€™s been available to him". Niska ran in the Republican primary for Attorney General of Minnesota in 2018, saying he would focus on consumer protection and criticizing incumbent Lori Swanson for signing onto a lawsuit challenging Trump's travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. He withdrew from the primary in November 2017, citing family considerations. Niska was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022.

Personal Life:
Harry and his wife Jen have been married for 16 years. They live in Ramsey with their three children, who attend Legacy Christian Academy in Andover. Both Harry and Jen have dedicated countless hours to serving their community in Ramsey and Andover.

Jen serves on the ARAA board, and the school board at Legacy Christian Academy.
