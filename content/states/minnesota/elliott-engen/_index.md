Elliott Engen is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives. He represents District 36A, which includes the cities of Lino Lakes, White Bear Township, and Circle Pines, and parts of Anoka and Ramsey Counties in Minnesota.

Born and raised in White Bear Lake, Engen attended White Bear Lake Area schools where he met his wife, Faith. He was a student-athlete, participated in student-led Christian organizations, and led extensive volunteer work in and out of school.

Engen holds a Bachelor's degree in legal studies and political science from Hamline University. While at Hamline, Engen started a chapter of the right-wing student organization Turning Point USA. He was encouraged to run for office by Iowa state representative Joe Mitchell while the two were discussing policy in a hot tub at a Turning Point USA Student Action Summit. Engen has said he no longer supports the organization.

Before joining the legislature, Engen worked for a wildlife conservation group focused on invasive species prevention. He first ran for office in 2020, unsuccessfully challenging one-term DFL incumbent Ami Wazlawik. He ran again and won in 2022 in an open seat created by legislative redistricting and Wazlawik's retirement. He is the first Generation Z Republican elected to the Minnesota Legislature.

In the Minnesota House of Representatives, Engen serves as an assistant minority leader for the House Republican caucus and sits on the Human Services Policy, Public Safety Finance and Policy, and Rules and Legislative Administration Committees. His 2022 campaign platform focused on public safety, education, and pocketbook concerns. He is anti-abortion and has claimed it won't be an issue that Republicans address due to a prior state supreme court decision. Engen has voted against legislation that codified the right to an abortion into state law, and a law to restore voting rights for felons serving parole. He opposed a move to raise legislators' per diem payments, calling it self-centered and egregious. In 2023, Engen authored the Safe Haven In Every Local District (SHIELD) Act, which would require school security system improvements.
