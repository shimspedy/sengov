Dawn Gillman, born on October 8, 1973, is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. She is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 17A in central Minnesota. This district includes the cities of Hutchinson and Glencoe and parts of McLeod, Meeker, Sibley, and Wright Counties.

Before her political career, Gillman attended St. Cloud Technical and Community College, earning a dental R.D.A. and C.D.A. She served six years on the Dassel city council before her election to the state legislature. In addition to her political career, Gillman is a business owner and communications consultant.

Gillman is also known for founding "Let Them Play", an organization advocating for reopening youth sports while statewide COVID-19 restrictions were in place. She believes that the government should not restrict kids' freedom as it's causing harm to their well-being without factual basis.

In the Minnesota House of Representatives, Gillman serves on the Environment and Natural Resources Finance and Policy, Human Services Finance, and Sustainable Infrastructure Policy Committees. She was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022 after six-term Republican incumbent Glenn Gruenhagen announced he would run for a seat in the Minnesota Senate.

On a personal note, Gillman lives in Dassel, Minnesota, with her husband, Brian, and has five children.
