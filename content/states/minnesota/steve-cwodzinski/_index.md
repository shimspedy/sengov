Steve A. Cwodzinski, born on September 8, 1958, is an American politician and a member of the Minnesota Senate. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 49, which includes Eden Prairie and Minnetonka, in the western Twin Cities metropolitan area.

Cwodzinski was born and raised in Superior, Wisconsin. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in education and later, a master's degree in education.

For over 30 years, Cwodzinski taught government and history classes at Eden Prairie High School. His dedication and passion for teaching were recognized when he received the Presidential Scholar's Influential Teacher Award. He also authored a book titled "Beyond the Lesson Plan," which encapsulates the lessons he learned during his years in the classroom.

In 2016, Cwodzinski decided to venture into politics and ran for the Minnesota Senate. He defeated incumbent David Hann, the Republican minority leader, in a close race. He served Minnesota Senate District 48 until redistricting in 2022. In the same year, he was reelected in District 49 with 62.3% of the vote, defeating Marla Helseth.

As a senator, Cwodzinski chairs the Minnesota Senate Education Policy Committee. He also serves on several other committees, including Education Finance, Elections, State and Local Government, and Veterans.

On a personal note, Cwodzinski and his wife, Patti, have two children and two grandchildren. They reside in Eden Prairie. Cwodzinski is a self-proclaimed outdoors enthusiast and has traveled to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness almost every summer since 1979.
