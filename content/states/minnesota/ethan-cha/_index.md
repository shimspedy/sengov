Ethan Cha is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 47B in the southeast Twin Cities metropolitan area. This district includes the city of Woodbury and parts of Washington County.

Cha was born in a Thai refugee camp and immigrated to the United States as a child. He grew up in Minnesota and attended Saint Paul public schools, where he learned English. Cha lived in California for many years and moved back to Minnesota in 2021 to care for his elderly parents.

In 2022, Cha was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives. He first ran in an open seat after the 2022 legislative redistricting and defeated former state representative Kelly Fenton, who represented Woodbury from 2015 to 2019. Cha sits on the Agriculture Finance and Policy, Commerce Finance and Policy, Housing Finance and Policy, and Legacy Finance Committees.

Cha, who is Hmong, is the chair of the Minnesota Asian and Pacific Caucus in the Minnesota Legislature. This caucus advocated for an anti-hate crime bill in the wake of an increase in anti-Asian backlash related to COVID-19's origins.

Cha ran on a platform concentrating on education, climate change, and defending abortion access. In the 2022 Minnesota State House - District 47B election, Cha received 10,627 votes, which accounted for 53.13% of the total votes.

Cha lives in Woodbury, Minnesota, and has three children. He identifies as Hmong.
