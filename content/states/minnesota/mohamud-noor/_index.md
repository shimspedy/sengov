Mohamud Noor is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2019. He is a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 60B, which includes parts of the city of Minneapolis in Hennepin County.

Born in Somalia in 1978, Noor and his family sought asylum in Kenya following the start of the civil war. In 1999, they emigrated to the United States and settled in Minnesota. Noor earned a B.S. in computer science from Metropolitan State University and worked as a system administrator for the Minnesota Department of Human Services.

Before his political career, Noor was the former director of the Confederation of Somali Community in Minnesota, a Minneapolis-based NGO serving immigrants. In that role, he advocated for funding for Somali youth programs, job skills programs, childcare programs, and mental health services. He criticized Republicans and Donald Trump for rising anti-Islamic sentiment in 2016, and praised President Barack Obama for visiting a mosque and speaking out in support of Muslim Americans.

Noor's political journey began with local campaigns. In 2010, he ran for a seat on the board of the Minneapolis Public Schools, finishing in fifth place. In December 2013, he was appointed to the Minneapolis school board after the death of Hussein Samatar. He resigned from the school board to run for the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2014.

In 2011, Noor lost to Kari Dzeidzic in a special election DFL primary for an open Minnesota Senate seat created by the retirement of nine-term incumbent Larry Pogemiller. In 2017, Noor challenged incumbent Abdi Warsame for City Council in Minneapolis Ward 6. He said he was "extremely disappointed" with Warsame's work on the council and that he would focus on jobs, housing, and police reform, and engage with constituents more than Warsame.

Noor assumed office on January 8, 2019. His current term ends on January 7, 2025. He has been assigned to various committees including the House Higher Education Finance and Policy Committee, Human Services Finance and Policy Committee, and Ways and Means Committee.
