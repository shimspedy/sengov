Alex Falconer is an American politician and environmental activist who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2025. A dedicated member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), he represents District 49A in the southwestern Twin Cities metropolitan area, which includes parts of Eden Prairie and Minnetonka in Hennepin County, Minnesota.

Falconer was born on August 30, 1980. He attended Red Wing High School in Red Wing and later earned a Bachelor of Science in biology from Saint Olaf College in Northfield. His early career was marked by a strong commitment to environmental advocacy, working as a campaign manager for Save the Boundary Waters. In 2021, he completed a 110-mile run in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area for the film Boundary Waters Traverse to raise awareness for the campaign and environmental advocacy at large.

In 2024, Representative Laurie Pryor announced her retirement from the Minnesota House of Representatives, leaving the seat for District 49A open. Falconer declared his candidacy and defeated Minnetonka City Council member Kissy Coakley in the DFL primary. He then won the general election with over 60% of the vote against Republican Stacy L. Bettison.

Falconer is an avid outdoorsman and trail runner. He lives in Eden Prairie with his wife Erica and their three children. He coaches cross country at Minnetonka Middle School East and Nordic skiing at Minnetonka High School. His dedication to his community and passion for environmental issues continue to drive his work in the Minnesota House of Representatives.
