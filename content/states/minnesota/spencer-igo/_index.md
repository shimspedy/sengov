Spencer R. Igo, born on March 26, 1996, is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2021. He is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 7A in northern Minnesota, which includes the city of Hibbing and parts of Aitkin, Itasca, and St. Louis Counties.

Early Life and Education:
Igo grew up in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, and graduated from Grand Rapids High School. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in public administration from the University of North Dakota.

Career:
Before his political career, Igo worked as a field director for Jason Lewis's 2018 campaign for the United States House of Representatives. He then worked as Congressman Pete Stauber's northern field representative in Minnesota's 8th congressional district from 2019 to 2021.

Minnesota House of Representatives:
Igo was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2020 and was reelected in 2022. He first ran after two-term Republican incumbent Sandy Layman announced that she would not seek reelection. Following 2022 legislative redistricting, he was drawn into the same area as DFL Representative Julie Sandstede, whom he defeated in the general election. Igo serves as an assistant minority leader for the House Republican caucus and sits on the Climate and Energy, Economic Development, and Sustainable Infrastructure Committees.

Igo has been outspoken in his support of the mining and timber industries in northern Minnesota, and critical of the state environmental review process. He has argued that bans on mining will send mining jobs overseas where environmental and labor standards are lower and described himself as "pro-labor, against right-to-work." After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Igo wrote a letter calling on President Joe Biden to increase oil production and mining to decrease reliance on foreign imports. In 2021, Igo proposed legislation to hold a wolf hunting season. Igo opposed efforts to ban lead fishing tackles due to concerns with implementation and the high cost of alternatives.

Electoral History:
In the 2020 Minnesota State House - District 5B election, Igo received 61.04% of the votes. In the 2022 Minnesota State House - District 7A election, Igo received 53.75% of the votes.
