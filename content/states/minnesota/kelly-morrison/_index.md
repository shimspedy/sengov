Morrison is a practicing obstetrician and gynecologist. She has spent most of her career as a doctor, dedicating her life to helping people. Her husband, John Willoughby, was an Army Ranger, and their family has always valued service above all.

Political Career:
Morrison was first elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2018, defeating Republican incumbent Cindy Pugh. She was reelected in 2020, defeating Republican nominee Andrew Myers.

She was endorsed by Speaker of the Minnesota House Melissa Hortman and U.S. Representative Dean Phillips. On November 9, 2023, Morrison announced she would run in the Democratic primary for Minnesota's 3rd congressional district in the 2024 House elections, after the incumbent, Dean Phillips, decided to run against President Joe Biden in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries.
