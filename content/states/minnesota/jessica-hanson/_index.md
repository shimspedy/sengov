Jessica "Jess" Hanson was born on September 13, 1986. She is an American politician serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2021. A member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), Hanson represents District 55A in the southern Twin Cities metropolitan area, which includes the cities of Burnsville and Savage and parts of Dakota and Scott Counties.

Hanson was born and raised in Minnesota. She earned a Bachelor of Science in social work from St. Catherine University and a Master of Arts in advocacy and political leadership from Metropolitan State University. Hanson has worked as a dental network representative for Anthem since 2007. Before her election to the legislature, Hanson led the Minnesota Campaign for Full Legalization, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on marijuana legalization.

Hanson was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2020 and reelected in 2022. She first ran after one-term DFL incumbent Hunter Cantrell announced he would not seek reelection. Hanson defeated former Republican representative and state auditor candidate Pam Myhra in the general election. In 2020, Hanson had her election results challenged, but a judge dismissed the case for failing to state a claim and a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Hanson serves as vice chair of the Economic Development Finance and Policy Committee, and sits on the Children and Families Finance and Policy, Higher Education Finance and Policy, and Human Services Policy Committees. Hanson authored "Travis's Law", which requires 911 operators to refer calls to mental health teams trained to deescalate serious mental health episodes. The bill was named after Travis Jordan, a man considering suicide who was shot and killed by Minneapolis police in 2018. Hanson's bill passed with bipartisan support and was signed by Governor Walz.

Hanson has advocated the legalization of marijuana in Minnesota, arguing it should be done by legislation, not a constitutional referendum. She has said that regulating marijuana would benefit public health and public safety. Hanson authored legislation to repeal a gag order on the study for a Dan Patch commuter rail line that would link Northfield, Minnesota to Minneapolis. She said that the line, which would run through Savage, Minnesota, could improve public transportation in her district.
