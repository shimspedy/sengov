Career Highlights:
In 2007, Greenman worked as a legal intern at the Brennan Center for Justice. In 2008, she was a summer associate at King & Spalding. She was then a legal intern in the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. In 2010, she was the deputy campaign manager of Margaret Anderson Kelliher's campaign for governor of Minnesota. She then worked as an attorney in the Public Defender's Office in Ramsey County, Minnesota, and as a state director for the Service Employees International Union.

From 2013 to 2015, Greenman was a political trainer for Wellstone Action, a progressive advocacy organization. She also worked as an attorney for Maslon LLP from 2012 to 2015.
