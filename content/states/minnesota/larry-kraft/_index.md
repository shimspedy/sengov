Larry Kraft (born January 24, 1966) is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2023. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) and represents District 46A, which includes the city of St. Louis Park in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, and parts of Hennepin County.

Kraft received his bachelor's degree in computer science and his masters in business administration from Cornell University. Prior to his political career, Kraft worked in the tech industry but left to become executive director of iMatter, a national nonprofit based in the Twin Cities focused on youth activism pushing for solutions to climate change. He helped mentor student groups that advocated for St. Louis Park to adopt a climate action plan.

Kraft has served in many capacities for the city of St. Louis Park, including as a city council member, environment and sustainability commissioner, and a member of the climate action plan committee and the steering committee for St. Louis Park arts and culture strategic framework development. While on the city council, he was the lone dissenting vote on a ban of vaping products and e-cigarettes, saying it was getting ahead of federal regulations.

In January 2022, Kraft led a coalition of 16 Minnesota cities that declared a climate emergency and urged the state legislature to address the crisis. Kraft was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2022. He first ran after redistricting and after seven-term DFL incumbent Ryan Winkler announced he would run for Hennepin County Attorney.

Kraft serves as vice chair of the Climate and Energy Finance and Policy Committee and sits on the Commerce Finance and Policy, Sustainable Infrastructure Policy, and Transportation Finance and Policy Committees. In the 2022 Minnesota State House - District 46A election, Kraft received 16,013 votes, accounting for 97.88% of the total votes.

Kraft lives in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, with his wife, Lauri, and has two children.
