Anquam Mahamoud is a dedicated and passionate politician serving as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives for District 62B. Born in 1989 in San Diego, California, Mahamoud moved to Minneapolis with her family in 1998. She pursued her education at St. Catherine University in Saint Paul, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology in 2012.

Before entering the political arena, Mahamoud built a career as a substance treatment and mental health provider. She held various roles, including serving as the Chief Operating Officer of Twin Cities Health Services. Her work in this field demonstrated her commitment to improving the lives of individuals struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues.

In February 2024, three-term representative Hodan Hassan announced that she would not seek re-election for District 62B. Mahamoud seized the opportunity and announced her candidacy, seeking the endorsement of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. She successfully secured the party's endorsement in a competitive field of candidates. In the 2024 general election, Mahamoud won the seat by a significant margin, defeating her Republican opponent, Bob Sullentrop, by nearly 75 percentage points.

As a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, Mahamoud is committed to addressing critical issues such as healthcare, education, and social justice. She serves on several committees, including Energy Finance and Policy, Health Finance and Policy, and Judiciary Finance and Civil Law. Her dedication to her constituents and her passion for creating positive change make her a respected and influential figure in Minnesota politics.

Mahamoud's journey from San Diego to Minneapolis and her rise in the political landscape is a testament to her resilience, determination, and unwavering commitment to public service. She continues to work tirelessly to represent the interests of her district and to make a meaningful impact on the lives of the people she serves.
