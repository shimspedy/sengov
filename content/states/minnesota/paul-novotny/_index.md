Paul Novotny
=============
Born on May 26, 1966, Paul Novotny is an American politician who has been serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2020. He is a member of the Republican Party of Minnesota and represents District 30B in east-central Minnesota. This district includes the cities of Elk River and Otsego and parts of Anoka, Sherburne, and Wright Counties.

Early Life and Education
------------------------
Novotny grew up on a dairy farm in Elk River, Minnesota. He graduated from North Hennepin Community College with an A.A.S. in law enforcement.

Career
------
Before his political career, Novotny worked as a police officer in Princeton, Minnesota, and was a sergeant for the Sherburne County Sheriff's Office. Over the course of his 30-year career, he served as an investigative sergeant and a firearms instructor.

Political Career
----------------
Novotny was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in a special election on February 4, 2020. He won a full term in November 2020 and was reelected in 2022. Novotny first ran after four-term incumbent Nick Zerwas resigned to spend more time with his family. During the 2021-22 legislative session, Novotny served as an assistant minority leader. He serves as the minority lead on the Public Safety Finance and Policy Committee and sits on the Human Services Policy and Ways and Means Committees.

Political Positions
-------------------
Novotny opposes ending qualified immunity for police officers and banning no-knock warrants. He drafted legislation that would require more transparency when third-party organizations post bail for someone. He has argued that bail should be set for violent offenders who pose a threat to society, not nonviolent low-level offenses. Novotny opposed a provision that would give families of those killed by police money for burial costs and trauma services. Novotny supported a DFL bill requiring judges to issue "sign and release" warrants for certain misdemeanor offenses instead of arrest warrants. He co-authored a bill establishing harsher penalties for the sale or possession of fentanyl, and legislation that would create an electronic database to track the sale of used catalytic converters in response to an increase in theft. Novotny spoke against a state office of youth restorative justice because it would increase bureaucracy. Novorny opposed legislation to restore the right to vote to felons while they are on parole, saying it is unfair to the victims of serious crimes such as homicides.

Personal Life
-------------
Novotny is married to Nicole and they have two children. They reside in Elk River, Minnesota.
