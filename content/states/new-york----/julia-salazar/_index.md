Julia Salazar, born on December 30, 1990, is an American politician and activist. She is currently serving as the New York State Senator for the 18th district, which covers much of northern Brooklyn, centered on Bushwick.

Salazar won the seat as a first-time candidate after unseating incumbent Senator Martin Malave Dilan in the Democratic Party primary in 2018. This victory brought her national media attention, particularly for her support for sex workers' rights and other progressive views. As a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, she became the first member of the organization to serve in New York's state legislature.

Salazar was born in Miami. Her mother is an American citizen by birth, and her father is a naturalized American citizen from Colombia. Her parents divorced during her childhood. Salazar was raised in a secular conservative home and at 18 registered as a Republican. In March 2010, she registered with the Independence Party of New York, believing it meant she was an independent voter.

Salazar attended Columbia University, but did not earn a degree. While there, Salazar was pro-life and a member of pro-Israel Christian student groups, but after a trip to Israel with Birthright Israel, her political views began to shift and she became involved in campus Jewish life and tenant organizing. After college, she became a grassroots organizer and campaigned extensively for legislation around police accountability.

While attending college, Salazar worked as a nanny for four years on the Upper West Side and as a housecleaner. This, in combination with her study of Middle Eastern history, led her to become more class-conscious. She began as an activist by organizing a tenant group with which she launched a rent strike against poor conditions in her housing block. She then worked at a social justice non-profit, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ) as an organizer.

In April 2018, Salazar announced her candidacy for the 18th district of the New York State Senate in the Democratic primary against incumbent Senator Martin Malave Dilan, who had held his position since 2002. She ran as a democratic socialist.
