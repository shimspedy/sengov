Frederick W. Thiele Jr., commonly known as Fred Thiele, was born on August 8, 1953, in Southampton, New York. He is a lifelong resident of Sag Harbor, New York, where he currently lives with his wife NancyLynn. They have three children, Michael, Jeffrey, and Josephine, and three grandchildren.

Thiele is a 1971 graduate of Pierson High School. He attended Cornell University and is a 1976 graduate of Southampton College of Long Island University. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree, summa cum laude, in Political Science and History. In 1979, he received his law degree from Albany Law School. In 1980, he was admitted to the Bar in the State of New York.

Thiele began his career in government service in 1975 after he was selected by his college to participate in the New York State Assembly Intern Program. Upon graduation from law school in 1979, Thiele became counsel to then-Assemblyman John Behan of Montauk. He served in that capacity until 1982.

From 1982�1987, Thiele was Southampton Town Attorney. During his tenure as Town Attorney, he was the town�s chief legal officer and was involved in the implementation of open space and environmental zoning and land preservation programs.

In November 1987, Thiele was elected to the Suffolk County Legislature. As a Legislator, Thiele chaired the Energy and Environment Committee and enacted legislation that nominated Peconic Bay and Gardiners Bay for the National Estuary Program.

In November 1991, Thiele was elected as an Independent to serve as Southampton Town Supervisor. Under his leadership, the Town decreased taxes for three consecutive years, bringing much-needed stability to the Town's finances. He enacted a number of important initiatives including open space preservation, affordable housing, environmental protection, comprehensive long-term planning, economic development, and government reform.

In 1995, Thiele was elected to the New York State Assembly to fill the seat vacated by Assemblyman John Behan. The district includes the Town of East Hampton, the Town of Southampton, the Town of Shelter Island, and the southeastern portion of the Town of Brookhaven.

Thiele is an American politician who serves in the New York State Assembly from the 1st district since 2013 and the 2nd district from 1995 to 2012, as a member of multiple political parties. Thiele was originally elected as a member of the Republican Party, but switched to the Independence Party of New York in 2009. He joined the Democratic Party after the Independence Party lost its ballot position.
