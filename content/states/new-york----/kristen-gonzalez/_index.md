Kristen S. Gonzalez, born on August 6, 1995, is an American politician and a member of the New York State Senate. She is a member of the Democratic Party and represents the 59th district, which contains parts of Queens, Manhattan, and Brooklyn.

Gonzalez was born in Elmhurst, Queens to a Puerto Rican mother and a Colombian father. She attended Dalton, a prep school on the Upper East Side. After high school, she attended Columbia University.

Gonzalez announced her candidacy for New York's 17th Senate District in the 2022 general election. Due to subsequent redistricting, Gonzalez changed her candidacy to the 59th Senate District. Gonzalez's biggest competition in the Democratic primary was former New York City council member Elizabeth Crowley, cousin of former Congressman Joe Crowley. Crowley outspent Gonzalez four to one during the campaign. Nomiki Konst also ran for the seat before withdrawing her candidacy and endorsing Gonzalez. On August 24, 2022, Gonzalez beat Crowley by over twenty-five percentage points. She represents portions of Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens — including the neighborhoods of Astoria, Greenpoint, Williamsburg, Stuyvesant Town, and Long Island City.

In the New York State Senate, 59th district, 2022 election, Kristen Gonzalez received 13,115 votes (58.14%) in the Democratic primary. In the general election, she received a total of 69,050 votes (98.9%).

Kristen Gonzalez is a former tech worker and community organizer, born and raised in a working-class family in Queens. She represents District 59, covering parts of Western Queens, Northern Brooklyn and the East Side of Manhattan. As the youngest woman ever elected to the NYS Senate and Chair of the Internet and Technology Committee, she passed legislation protecting our state’s critical infrastructure from cyber attacks and helped safeguard the right to an abortion by protecting private health data. She believes every New Yorker deserves to life a dignified life, which is why she champions workers’ rights, a Green New York, deeply affordable housing and tenant protections. Before being elected to the NYS Senate, Senator Gonzalez worked in the New York City Council, the Obama White House, and Senator Chuck Schumer’s office. She has also organized in her community with the Western Queens Community Land Trust, served on her community board, and helped launch a citywide campaign for public internet.
