Sarah Clark is an American politician from the state of New York. A Democrat, Clark has represented the 136th district of the New York State Assembly, based in outer Rochester and the nearby suburbs of Irondequoit and Brighton, since November 2020.

Early Career:
After graduating from East High School and Stony Brook University, Clark interned for then-Mayor of Rochester Bill Johnson. Clark went on to work for U.S. Senators Hillary Clinton and Kirsten Gillibrand, serving as Gillibrand's deputy state director from her appointment in 2009 onwards.

Political Career:
In 2020, after incumbent Jamie Romeo was appointed as Monroe County Clerk, Clark announced she would run for the 136th district of the New York State Assembly. With the backing of Hillary Clinton, Kirsten Gillibrand, and the Working Families Party, Clark handily won the Democratic primary over county legislator Justin Wilcox. Clark faced no major-party opposition in the general election, and was seated in the Assembly on November 12. In 2022, Clark was re-elected to a second term after defeating Republican candidate, Orlando Rivera.

Personal Life:
Clark lives in the Maplewood neighborhood of Rochester with her husband, John, and their three children. She is a lifelong Rochester resident and SUNY Stony Brook graduate. She has dedicated her entire career to public service.

As a working mom and mentor to other moms interested in public office, Sarah is eager to utilize her community connections and experience to elevate the needs of children and families across New York. As a second term member of the NYS Assembly, she now serves as the Chair of House Operations and the Subcommittee on the Tuition Assistance Program. She is also a member of the Children and Families, Aging, Higher Education, Local Governments, and Mental Health committees, as well as a member of the Task Force on Women’s Issues and serves on the executive board of the Legislative Women’s Caucus.
