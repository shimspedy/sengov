Joe Angelino is an American politician and law enforcement officer currently serving as a member of the New York State Assembly from the 121st district. He was elected to this position in November 2020 and assumed office on January 6, 2021.

Born on December 24, 1959, in Norwich, New York, Angelino has been a lifelong resident of Central New York. From a young age, his parents instilled in him the values of honesty, hard work, and compassion towards others. These traits have been instrumental in shaping his career and public service.

Angelino's military service began in 1985 when he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. His natural leadership abilities quickly became evident, propelling him upward through the ranks. He is a three-time combat veteran over two wars, having served as a tank commander in Desert Storm and an infantry 1st Sgt. during the Iraq Invasion in 2003, and again in 2005. For his service, he received two Purple Heart medals. He retired from the Marine reserves as a Sergeant Major, the highest enlisted rank, in 2008.

Parallel to his military career, Angelino also had a distinguished career in law enforcement. He served the Norwich Police Department, eventually retiring as the chief of police. During his tenure as the Chief of Police, he was also tapped to simultaneously act as the city�s Fire Chief from 2006 to 2008, making him responsible for more than half of the city�s budget and personnel.

As an Assemblyman, Joseph works to protect the interests of New York�s incredible law enforcement agents, ensure veterans have every opportunity to thrive upon returning from service, and fight for the state�s struggling middle class.

Outside of his public service, Joseph is active in several other activities. He has served as a past board member and past president of the Northeast Classic Car Museum and a past member of the Norwich Housing Authority. He was also a past member of the Chenango County Traffic Safety Board. Currently, he serves as a volunteer firefighter with the G.L. Rider Hook & Ladder Company of the Norwich Fire Department.

In recognition of his service, he has been awarded the Chenango County Bar Association Liberty Bell Award and the Distinguished Citizen Award for Chenango County.

Joseph is married to Kendall Saber and they reside in Norwich.
