Amy Paulin was born on November 29, 1955, in Brooklyn, New York. She graduated from the University of Rochester with a degree in political science and went on to earn a master's degree in public administration from New York University. She has also completed doctoral coursework in Criminal Justice from SUNY-Albany.

Amy Paulin was elected to the New York State Assembly in November 2000 and has since been re-elected seven times. She represents the 88th Assembly District which includes Scarsdale, Edgemont, Eastchester, Bronxville, Tuckahoe, Pelham, Pelham Manor, and parts of New Rochelle and White Plains.

In her role, Paulin chairs the Assembly Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, and serves on the Committees on Rules, Education, and Health. She previously chaired the Assembly Committee on Energy and before that chaired the Committee on Libraries and Education Technology and the Task Force on People with Disabilities.

Paulin's diverse legislative agenda includes health care, education, reproductive rights, child welfare, support for families, domestic violence prevention, sex trafficking elimination, government reform, sustainability, animal welfare, and gun control. She has been particularly active in championing expanded broadband access, public transportation, and utility resiliency.

Over 350 of her bills have been signed into law to date. Among her most important legislative accomplishments include writing and sponsoring the bill that eliminated the statute of limitations for rape, sponsoring the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection and Justice Act, which dramatically toughened penalties for traffickers and buyers while providing support to the victims of human trafficking to help rebuild their lives, and authoring the Birth Control Access Act, which greatly expanded access to birth control for New Yorkers by allowing pharmacists to dispense hormonal contraception.

Amy Paulin resides in Scarsdale with her husband, Ira Schuman. They have three children; Beth, Sarah, and Joseph.
