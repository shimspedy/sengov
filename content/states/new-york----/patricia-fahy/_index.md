Patricia Fahy is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She currently represents parts of Albany County in the New York State Assembly, including most of western Albany. She was previously president of the Albany City Board of Education.

Fahy assumed office on January 1, 2013. Her current term ends on January 1, 2025. Fahy is running for election to the New York State Senate to represent District 46. She declared candidacy for the Democratic primary scheduled on June 25, 2024.

Fahy earned her B.S. in political science from Northern Illinois University and her M.P.A. from the University of Illinois at Chicago. She serves on the Board of Directors of the UAlbany Center for Women in Government & Civil Society, and previously served on the Board of the Boys and Girls Club of Albany. Before moving to Albany, Fahy served as the Executive Director of the Chicago Workforce Board.

In the 2013-2014 legislative session, Fahy served on several committees. In the 2023-2024 session, Fahy was assigned to the Economic Development, Job Creation, Commerce and Industry Committee, Environmental Conservation Committee, Higher Education Committee, and Transportation Committee.

Fahy fought Governor Andrew Cuomo's proposed 2014-2015 education budget. She praised Cuomo's environmental efforts, but questioned the timing of delays to environmental review. In February 2017, Fahy, along with Albany mayor Kathy Sheehan and congressman Paul Tonko, were criticized by Bishop Edward Scharfenberger for being Catholic politicians who supported and attended a rally for Planned Parenthood.
