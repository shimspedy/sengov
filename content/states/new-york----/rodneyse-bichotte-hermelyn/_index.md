Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn is a distinguished member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 42nd Assembly District in Brooklyn, which encompasses Ditmas Park, Flatbush, East Flatbush, and Midwood. She is the first Haitian American woman elected in New York City.

Born and raised in Flatbush, Brooklyn, she is the daughter of Haitian immigrants and heir to Haiti�s slave abolitionist Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Her unique background and upbringing have shaped her commitment to public service and advocacy for her constituents.

Assemblymember Bichotte Hermelyn holds several key positions in the New York State Assembly. She is the Majority Whip, Chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises (MWBEs), and serves on several committees including Housing, Education, Governmental Operations, Health, Higher Education, and Ways & Means. She also sits on Governor Kathy Hochul's Domestic Violence Advisory Council and New York City Mayor Eric Adams� MWBE Task Force.

Since becoming a legislator in 2015, she has introduced over 200 pieces of Legislation, 34 of which became law, and has co-sponsored over 250 others. She has been an outspoken and ardent advocate on issues concerning her Assembly District and all New Yorkers, including immigration, education, economic development, unemployment, education reform, healthcare access, senior citizen centers, affordable housing, school safety and women�s and LGBTQ rights, as well as other issues affecting the quality of life in the community.

As the New York State Assembly Majority Whip, Assemblymember Bichotte Hermelyn works to ensure that her fellow legislators are united on passing bills that aid their constituents and uplift all New Yorkers. As the Chair of the MWBE Subcommittee, she has been instrumental in the passage of laws she sponsored to help MWBEs thrive and succeed.

Assemblymember Bichotte Hermelyn is also a new mother to a healthy baby boy. Having previously lost a son in 2016 after being turned away from a hospital in a high-risk situation, she is committed to ending the maternal healthcare crisis and addressing maternal mortality disparities disproportionately affecting Black and minority women. She sponsored the Jonah Bichotte Cowan Law (named after her late son), which establishes requirements for treatment when a mother comes to a hospital with concerns about being in pre-term labor.
