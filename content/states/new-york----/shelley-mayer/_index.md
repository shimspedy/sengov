Shelley Mayer was born on March 6, 1952, in Yonkers, New York. She is an American politician serving as a Democratic member of the New York State Senate representing the 37th Senate District, which includes portions of Westchester County. 

Mayer's journey into politics began with her education. She received her B.A. at the University of California, Los Angeles, and later earned her J.D. at the University at Buffalo Law School. Before her election to public office, Mayer was a Senior Counsel at the National State Attorney General Program at Columbia University, where she focused on health care and labor law rights. 

From 2007 until early 2011, Mayer worked as Chief Counsel to the New York State Senate Conference in Albany. For over seven years, she served as Vice President of Government and Community Affairs at Continuum Health Partners in New York City. From 1982 to 1994, Mayer served as an Assistant Attorney General in the office of New York Attorney General Bob Abrams. She served in the Civil Rights Bureau, as Chief of the Westchester Regional Office, as the legislative liaison for the Attorney General, and ultimately as a senior advisor to the Attorney General.

In 2006, Mayer made her first run for public office, losing a bid for the New York State Assembly to incumbent Republican Mike Spano. Spano later went on to change parties, ran for Mayor of Yonkers in 2011 as a Democrat, and won. Mayer was first elected to the New York State Assembly on March 20, 2012, in a special election to succeed Mike Spano, and was re-elected three times. 

Mayer was elected to the State Senate in a special election held on April 24, 2018, after the office was vacated by Westchester County Executive George Latimer. Mayer appeared on the Democratic, Working Families, and Women's Equality Party lines and won by a margin of 57% to 43%. Mayer attributed the win to a "big tent blue wave" that brought together progressives, Democrats, union groups, and female activists. 

Mayer lives in Yonkers with her husband, Lee Smith, with whom she has three adult children. Throughout her career, Mayer has been a champion for children and public schools. She has spent her career as an advocate for New Yorkers and is an experienced and progressive leader.
