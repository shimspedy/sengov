Joe DeStefano, a dedicated public servant, has devoted his life to making his community a better and safer place. Born on June 7, 1960, he has been serving his neighbors in various capacities for several decades.

His journey of public service began in 1980 when he volunteered with the Medford Fire Department. His commitment to the department has been unwavering, and he has been answering calls ever since. Over the past 28 years, he has held numerous positions within the department, including Fire Police Lieutenant, 2nd Lieutenant, Department Recording Secretary, Department Vice President, and Department President. He has also served with the Medford Volunteer Ambulance for the last 39 years.

In addition to his service in the fire department, Joe was a Public Safety Communication Supervisor in the Suffolk County Sheriffï¿½s Office for 27 years. In this role, he managed the day-to-day operations of the dispatchers and supervised radio communications and other vital functions.

Joe's dedication to his community extends beyond his public service roles. He is a long-time member of the Medford Civic Association and the Medford Chamber of Commerce. He was also the district manager of the Riverhead Fire District and is a life member of both the Medford Fire Department and Ambulance company.

In 2018, Joe was elected to the New York State Assembly, representing the 3rd district. The district includes portions of the town of Brookhaven, including Bellport and Mastic Beach in Suffolk County on Long Island. As an assemblyman, Joe fights for safer neighborhoods, stronger communities, and preserving the property tax cap while pushing Albany to curb spending. He is a proud supporter of fire services, law enforcement, and our military. Taxpayers across his district count him as an ally and know they can turn to him for assistance on governmental and community issues.

Joe DeStefano, a man of the community, continues to serve with the same dedication and commitment that has defined his life. His unwavering support for all the residents, organizations, and businesses in his district is a testament to his dedication to public service.
