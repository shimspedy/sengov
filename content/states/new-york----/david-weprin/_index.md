David Ira Weprin, born on May 2, 1956, is a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly, representing District 24 in Queens since 2010, when he replaced his brother Mark. He has devoted his life to public service and making government more responsive, efficient, and accountable.

Weprin was born in Queens to Saul and Sylvia Weprin and has lived in the Hollis-Jamaica area his entire life. He comes from a family of Democratic politicians. His parents were Sylvia (Matz), an immigrant from Havana, Cuba, and NY State Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, and his younger brother Mark Weprin is a former NY State Assemblyman and former NYC Councilman.

He is a graduate of Jamaica High School and received a cum laude bachelor's degree in Political Science from the State University of New York at Albany. He then received a J.D. degree from Hofstra Law School and was admitted to the New York bar in 1981.

In 1983, two years after Weprin was admitted to the bar, then-Governor Mario Cuomo, who was a close family friend and neighbor whom Weprin viewed as family, named him the Deputy Superintendent of Banks and Secretary of the Banking Board for New York State. The position was responsible for regulating financial firms in New York State. Weprin stepped down from the role in 1987.

Weprin next held a variety of positions at the Stern Brothers investment banking firm (as a vice president), Advest, Pearson, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette; Kidder Peabody; Paine Webber, and Sterne, Agee & Leach.

In 2001, Weprin was elected to the New York City Council by the people of the 23rd Council District in Queens. Within weeks of taking office Weprin became Chairman of the Council�s Finance Committee. Their choice to select a freshman Council Member to preside over the review and management of the City�s finances remains unprecedented and is a testament to his long-standing excellence in the field.

As Chair of the Council�s Finance Committee, Weprin proved to be a tireless advocate for responsible public spending and partnered with the Mayor and citizen advocacy groups to strengthen fiscal responsibility throughout all five boroughs. In 2008, Weprin was instrumental in locking away a total of $2.5 billion in surplus funds to ensure that future retirees continue to receive quality health care. Weprin led the charge with the Mayor to put more than one billion dollars back in the pockets of homeowners and co-op/condo owners in the form of annual $400 property tax rebates.

In the Assembly, he has supported progressive causes, such as a surcharge on millionaires, and granting immediate parole to prisoners who have reached 55 years of age and served 15 years in prison, regardless of their sentence.
