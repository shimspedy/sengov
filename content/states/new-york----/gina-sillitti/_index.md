Gina Sillitti was born on April 5, 1978, and she grew up in Mount Sinai, New York and Florida. She earned a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Georgia in 2000. She moved to Manorhaven in 2012 and is married to Kevin Clemency.

Before running for office, she spent nearly two decades in public service, starting at the Nassau County Legislature. During her time there, she worked to secure millions for local fire departments, helped thousands of constituents with issues from repairing potholes to navigating their personal tragedies, worked to get much-needed infrastructure projects delivered for the district and helped bring hundreds of thousands of dollars in community development block grants to improve local schools.

In 2010, Gina was appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Community Services in the Town of North Hempstead. In this role, she worked with a wide variety of constituency groups, including forming the first Asian-American Festival Committee to promote the growing cultural diversity in our town. She was promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff and the Director of Legislative Affairs for the Town where she served as liaison to officials at every level to ensure projects, grant requests and legislation received the proper attention. Gina was the point person on all special projects for the Town Supervisor involving the public, including as Chair of North Hempstead�s 9/11 Memorial Committee, a group consisting of members of the FDNY and NYPD, victims� families, local volunteer fire departments that responded to Ground Zero, veterans and local architects.

In 2015, Gina was recruited to serve as Director of Human Resources and Compliance at the Nassau County Board of Elections. There, she implemented new policies and procedures to modernize the office and save taxpayer dollars.

Gina Sillitti is an American Democratic Party politician who represents New York State Assembly district 16, which includes Port Washington, Manhasset, Great Neck, North Hills, East Hills, Flower Hill, Old Westbury, Roslyn Estates, Roslyn Heights, Herricks and Lake Success of Nassau County on Long Island.

She was nominated at the Nassau County Democratic Committee Convention on February 11, 2020, after Assemblyman Anthony D'Urso announced he would be retiring. Sillitti ran on a platform to increase state funding for local schools and roads, reducing property taxes, and protecting Long Island Sound and drinking water. She also advocated for stimulus relief from the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasized she would be accessible to her constituents.

In late February 2021, after the Andrew Cuomo sexual harassment allegations became public, Sillitti was among a group of assemblywomen who issued a statement calling for an independent investigator to be appointed by Attorney General Letitia James. She later pushed back against calls for his immediate resignation, being among 23 Democratic assemblywomen to say the attorney general's investigation should be completed first, in a split among New York Democrats.
