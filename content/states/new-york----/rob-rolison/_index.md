Rob Rolison is a dedicated public servant and proven leader who has earned a reputation for getting results. He was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, where he continues to reside.

Rob attended Marist College, majoring in Criminal Justice. In 1982, he joined the Town of Poughkeepsie Police Department where he served 12 years in the Patrol Division. Demonstrating his commitment and skill, Rob worked his way up the ranks and was promoted to Detective, a post he held for 14 years.

In addition to his law enforcement career, Rolison has also been active in politics. From 2003 to 2015, he served on the Dutchess County Legislature as a county legislator, even serving as chairman of the legislature from 2010 to 2015.

Following his tenure in the county legislature, Rolison served as Mayor of the City of Poughkeepsie, the 18th largest city in New York, for nearly two terms from 2016 to 2022.

On November 8, 2022, Rob was elected to the New York State Senate, representing District 39. His victory marked a significant moment as he flipped the seat to red after a victory margin of 6,738 votes.

Today, Rolison continues to serve in his first term as a New York State Senator, bringing his wealth of experience in law enforcement and local politics to the state level.
