Deborah J. Glick is a member of the New York State Assembly representing the 66th Assembly District in Lower Manhattan. The neighborhoods she represents include Alphabet City, Greenwich Village, Noho, SoHo, the East Village, the West Village, Tribeca, and Battery Park City. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

Glick is a lifelong resident of New York City and has lived in Greenwich Village for over 40 years. She graduated from the City University of New York's Queens College and received a Master of Business Administration degree from Fordham University. Before her political career, Glick owned and managed a small printing business in TriBeCa. She also served as the deputy director of general services at the New York City Department of Housing, Preservation, and Development until May 1990.

Glick's political activism began in college, and she continues to be strongly involved in grassroots organizing. She first ran for the State Assembly in 1990 and won, becoming the first openly gay state legislator in New York State. She has served in the legislature for over 30 years, championing a number of progressive legislative causes as well as key local issues. She is Jewish.

In the Assembly, Glick serves as the Chair of the Assembly's Higher Education Committee, which oversees all private and public higher education institutions, financial assistance for students, and professional licensing. She also serves on the Ways and Means, Rules, Governmental Operations, and Environmental Conservation Committees. She also serves as the Chair of the Assembly's Intern Program, overseeing the Assembly's student interns.

Her legislative priorities have focused on women's rights, including expanding access to reproductive healthcare; LGBTQ rights; environmental preservation and protection; the protection of animals, especially those in shelters; higher education; tenants' rights; increasing pedestrian and traffic safety; maintaining and expanding open space; and support for the arts.

Glick's legislative victories include the passage of the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act (SONDA), which was finally signed into law in December 2002. Glick's Hospital Visitation Bill became law in 2004, providing domestic partners the same rights that spouses and next-of-kin have when caring for a loved one in a hospital or nursing facility.
