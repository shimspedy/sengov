Jeff L. Gallahan, born on June 4, 1959, is an American politician serving as a member of the New York State Assembly from the 131st district. He was elected in November 2020 and assumed office on January 6, 2021.

Gallahan is a native of Ontario County, New York. He began his career as a union machinist for the General Railway Signal Company before transitioning into sales and management roles. In 2017, he and his wife founded CR7 Food Trailer and Catering, demonstrating their entrepreneurial spirit.

In addition to his business ventures, Gallahan has a history of public service. He served as a member of the Manchester, New York Town Council and held the position of town supervisor of Manchester for 15 years. His commitment to his community is evident in his political career.

As an Assemblyman, Gallahan fights to hold the line on taxes, end dangerous bail reform measures, and make New York a more affordable place to live, work, and raise a family. He is committed to standing up for middle-class values, small businesses, and the important agricultural community of his district.

His district is comprised of portions of Ontario, Seneca, Cayuga, Cortland, Madison, Broome, and Chenango counties. Gallahan believes that his real-world experience is beneficial to the people of his district and throughout New York. He is a believer in the “American Dream” and has raised his children to be hard-working while leading by example.
