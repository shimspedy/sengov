Jarett Gandolfo, born on June 22, 1990, is an American politician who is a member of the New York State Assembly from the 7th district. He was elected in 2020 and assumed office on January 1, 2021.

Gandolfo is of Italian-American descent and was raised in West Islip, New York. He graduated from West Islip High School. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in criminology and sociology from University at Albany, SUNY and a Master of Public Administration from Villanova University.

Before his election to the New York State Assembly, Gandolfo served as Andrew Garbarino's chief of staff. When Garbarino was elected to the United States House of Representatives, Gandolfo announced his candidacy to succeed him. Gandolfo defeated Democratic nominee Francis T. Genco in the November election and assumed office on January 1, 2021.

Once in office, Gandolfo became a vocal critic of Governor Andrew Cuomo's use of COVID-19 pandemic emergency powers, especially the 10pm curfew imposed on restaurants and bars. Gandolfo argued that the curfew was arbitrary, ineffective, and greatly harming the food service industry.

Gandolfo currently sits on the Health, Higher Education, Insurance, Mental Health, and Racing and Wagering committees. He continues to emphasize public safety, advocating for the repeal of Cashless Bail and for additional resources for local police. He also places a high priority on environmental protections, supporting the Clean Water Infrastructure Act, wetland protections, and open space preservation.

As gas and grocery prices have spiked, Gandolfo supported the Homeowner Tax Rebate Check program and middle-class tax cuts. And when Governor Hochul tried to override local zoning laws to force high density apartments into the suburbs, Gandolfo fought back and ultimately defeated the proposal.

In our local communities, Gandolfo has delivered funding to complete impactful projects - a student metal health center a new elementary school playground, major crosswalk upgrades in downtown Sayville, extra funding for our libraries, and much more. In his next term, Jarett will continue delivering quality of life improvements to our communities, while pushing for major infrastructure projects such as fixing the Oakdale Merge and expanding
