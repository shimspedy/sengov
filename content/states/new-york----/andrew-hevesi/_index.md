Andrew D. Hevesi was born on November 19, 1973, in Forest Hills, New York, U.S. He is a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly representing the 28th Assembly District, which includes Forest Hills, Rego Park, Richmond Hill, Glendale, Kew Gardens, Ridgewood, and Middle Village.

Hevesi is the son of former New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, and the brother of former New York State Senator Daniel Hevesi. Before being elected to the New York State Assembly, Hevesi held several public service positions, including a period in both the Queens District Attorney's office and as Director of Community Affairs for Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum. He also served as Chief of Staff for former New York State Senator Jeff Klein.

Hevesi has a BA degree in political science from Queens College. He married Rachel Ross in 2007 and the couple have a daughter.

On May 10, 2005, Hevesi won a special election to fill a seat left vacant by the resignation of former Assemblyman Michael Cohen, serving for the remainder of his term. Hevesi was re-elected in November 2006 and has been re-elected in all subsequent elections.

From June 2011 to February 2015, Assemblyman Hevesi served as Chairman of the Committee on Oversight, Analysis, and Investigation. As Chair, Assemblyman Hevesi held hearings on numerous topics including healthcare, human trafficking, and technology infrastructure in New York State.

In February 2015, Assemblyman Hevesi was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Social Services. Hevesi has secured a total of $6 million for freight locomotive engine upgrades in the 2013�2014 and 2014�2015 New York State Budgets. The initiative was prompted by a constituency in his district that suffered from constant locomotive idling and emissions from outdated locomotive engines.

In addition to his work locally, Assemblyman Hevesi was appointed Chair of the Assembly Standing Committee on Children and Families in January of 2021, having previously served as the Chairman of the Assembly Social Services Committee from 2015-2020. As Children and Families Chair, Assemblyman Hevesi has made it a top priority to address and mitigate childhood trauma.
