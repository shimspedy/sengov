Karen McMahon is an American lawyer and politician who serves in the New York State Assembly from the 146th district. This district represents the village of Williamsville, and the towns of Amherst and Pendleton.

Born on March 18, 1960, in Buffalo, New York, Karen was raised in Snyder. She earned both her undergraduate and law degrees at the University of Buffalo. Before her political career, McMahon served as a law clerk for state and federal judiciaries for many years.

In the November 6, 2018, election for the 146th district of the New York State Assembly, McMahon defeated four-term incumbent Republican Ray Walter. Her victory marked the beginning of her tenure in the New York State Assembly, which officially started on January 2, 2019.

As a member of the Democratic Party, McMahon has been involved in various initiatives and has made significant contributions during her time in office. For instance, she played a crucial role in the budget process for the fiscal year 2024-2025, delivering for individuals, families, businesses, and more.

Moreover, McMahon announced a major investment in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Buffalo in April 2024. This investment, amounting to $250 million, was included in the FY 2024-2025 state budget to establish Empire AI, a state-owned research and computing facility.

Throughout her career, McMahon has shown a commitment to supporting and honoring women. During Women’s History Month, she took the opportunity to recognize and celebrate the achievements of all women. She also sought nominations for her 6th annual Women of Distinction Awards, which honor women who have made significant contributions to their communities.

In addition to her work in the Assembly, McMahon has advocated for fair pay and benefits for New York’s workers. She has also teamed up with several Western New York state legislators and the Developmental Disability Alliance of WNY (DDAWNY) to call for funding in Governor Kathy Hochul’s Executive Budget.

Karen McMahon's dedication to her constituents and her efforts to improve the quality of life for the communities she serves are evident in her work. Her journey from a law clerk to a respected member of the New York State Assembly is truly inspiring.
