Carl Edward Heastie was born on September 25, 1967, in New York City. He is an American politician from New York and has served in the New York State Assembly since January 2001. Heastie has the historic distinction of being the first African-American to serve as leader of the Chamber�s 150 members representing communities across the state of New York.

Heastie earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Stony Brook University in Suffolk County, New York, and a M.B.A. in Finance from Baruch College in New York City. Before his election to the Assembly, Heastie worked as a budget analyst for the New York City Comptroller. Heastie has also worked as an adjunct professor at Monroe College.

Heastie was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 2000 and represents the 83rd District, which covers the Williamsbridge, Wakefield, Edenwald, Eastchester, and Baychester sections of the Northeast Bronx. Since joining the Assembly, Heastie became one of the lead negotiators for the construction of a new K-8 school in his district. He has also sponsored legislation to require mandatory reporting of alleged child abuse of students in New York City. He became Chair of the Assembly Labor Committee in 2013.

Heastie became Chair of the Bronx Democratic Party in 2008, a post that he relinquished after becoming Assembly Speaker in 2015. In January 2015, Heastie's Assembly colleagues considered him a frontrunner to be elected Speaker, following the arrest of Sheldon Silver on federal corruption charges led by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. On February 2, Assembly Democrats voted unanimously for Heastie to become the new Speaker. The full Assembly elected him Speaker of the Assembly the next day. Heastie is the first African-American to serve the position.

One of his first New York City appearances after becoming speaker was at Al Sharpton 's rally in Harlem, where he told the crowd, "This is a tremendous opportunity for our community, for the first time, to have one of us sit at the table," and added "All of you are going to be sitting at that table with me for the first time". In April 2015, it was reported that, contrary to a judge's instructions, Heastie had neglected to sell a home that his mother, Helene Heastie, according to prosecutors bought with money embezzled from a nonprofit charity.
