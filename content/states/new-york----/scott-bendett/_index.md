Scott Bendett is an American politician from New York who has represented the New York State Assembly's 107th district since 2023. The district consists of most of Rensselaer County and portions of Washington and Columbia counties.

Bendett attended Niskayuna High School and the University at Albany and currently resides in Averill Park, New York. Prior to his election to the State Assembly, Bendett was the founder and owner of the Habana Premium Cigar Shoppe in Sand Lake. He started the business in 1998 as a small kiosk and saw success as it grew into an online marketplace.

In addition to his cigar business, Bendett is also the CEO of the Bendett Investment Group, a real estate development firm. His political career began when he was elected to the Rensselaer County Legislature in 2017. He then ran unopposed to the 107th district after its prior assemblyman, Jake Ashby (R), was redistricted to the 43rd District. Bendett won with 97.5% of the vote after also securing the Conservative nomination.

Bendett was sworn in on January 2, 2023, at the Rensselaer County Courthouse. During his tenure, he has supported increasing the tax credit that emergency medical services volunteers receive in an effort to increase their numbers and retention. He has also co-sponsored the Psychedelic Assisted Therapy Bill, which would see the legalization of possession of psilocybin, ibogaine, and DMT in the state of New York. Bendett has supported the expansion of vocational education, including vocational classes in public high-schools.

In his personal life, Scott has a son named Samuel Bendett, who is an Eagle Scout. He has been a member of the town of Sand Lakeï¿½s Zoning Board of Appeals and served as a Rensselaer County Legislator prior to his election to the Assembly.
