Taylor Darling, also known as Taylor Raynor, is an American elected official from the state of New York. She is a Democrat, currently representing the 18th District in the New York State Assembly since 2019. Taylor is second-generation Nigerian, Trinidadian, and English and was reared in the Jewish and Episcopalian faiths.

Taylor Darling was born on November 21, 1983, in Brooklyn, New York. She is an American and British citizen, having lived in Europe in her youth during her father�s service in the military. Her parents - Raulston and Towana Bertley - were the blueprint for strength, hard work, knowledge, focus, and strategy. Raulston was a veteran, while Towana � who was a member of the United Federation of Teachers - devoted her life to law, justice, and education, teaching in the Uniondale School District on Long Island.

At the age of four, Taylor learned to play chess and eventually became a nationally-ranked chess player. Her father taught her how to play and enforced a strict practice routine for competitions. Taylor's father suffered from radiation poisoning while serving in the military in Europe, and the family moved back to Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn for better medical care. He eventually died when Taylor was just 10 years old.

When she was 11 years old, Taylor�s family relocated from Brooklyn to Nassau County on Long Island where she attended Turtle Hook Jr. High School and Uniondale High School, graduating early at the age of 16. The Talented and Gifted Program is what enabled her to skip a grade in middle school.

After high school, Taylor attended Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, one of the oldest and most prestigious historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the United States. U.S. News & World Report has ranked it the #1 HBCU for 17 years in a row. She spent three years there, once again graduating early at 19 years old.

Upon graduation, Taylor entered a Clinical Psychology doctoral program in Georgia. Three years later, Taylor�s mother became afflicted by a terminal illness, and she returned to Nassau County to care for her. During this time, she enrolled in the Industrial/Organizational Psychology master�s degree program at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.

Post college, Taylor worked as a business consultant. When she announced her plans to run for office, she was immediately terminated from her private sector job. On September 13, 2018, Taylor won the primary election for the New York State Assembly, representing the 18th Assembly District, after challenging 30-year incumbent Assemblywoman Earlene Hooper.
