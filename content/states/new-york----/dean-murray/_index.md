Dean Murray is a dedicated public servant and entrepreneur with a rich history of service and achievement. Born on July 22, 1964, he has made significant contributions in various fields throughout his career.

Education:
Dean graduated with honors from the Broadcast Institute of Maryland in 1985. His education laid the foundation for a successful career in radio and television news.

Career in Broadcasting:
For the next 10 years, Dean was involved in all aspects of radio and television news throughout Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York. He covered the Pennsylvania State Capital for over 100 radio stations and served on the Board of Directors of the Pennsylvania Associated Press. He also played 5 seasons of semi-pro football with the Chambersburg Cardinals and York Lions.

Move to Long Island:
In 1994, Dean moved to Long Island as an Advertising Sales Rep for TCI Cable. Within a year, he was promoted to Regional Sales Manager serving the Tri-State area. Despite his new role, Dean couldn't completely let go of his love for broadcasting. He periodically filled in doing morning news at WBLI Radio and also did the play-by-play radio broadcasts of local High School football games on WALK-AM.

Entrepreneurship:
In 1997, Dean took the entrepreneurial leap and started his own Advertising Agency � D & S Advertising, Inc. For nearly 25 years, the company published several specialty, free-publications. While the company no longer publishes the print versions, the LI Job Finder and LI Fugitive Finder websites are still active and extremely popular.

Political Career:
Dean was first elected to serve in the NYS Assembly in a special election in February of 2010 and was re-elected by a comfortable margin in November of 2010. Following a brief 2-year break, the voters returned Dean to the NYS Assembly in 2015, where he served for another 4 years. While in the Assembly, Dean led the fight to repeal the MTA payroll tax, eliminate the salt-water fishing license fee, pass the largest middle class tax cut in decades, and adopt the I-STOP program to help fight the serious problem of prescription drug abuse.

Community Service:
Dean has committed himself to serve his community in various ways. He�s been an active member of several Chamber of Commerce chapters throughout Suffolk County, served as a board member with the Patchogue Medford Youth & Community Services, the Focus East Patchogue Civic Organization, was a member of the Suffolk County Police Reserves, and also served on the Suffolk County Workforce Investment Board.

Personal Life:
Dean is extremely proud of his son, Anthony Dean Murray, who served 6 years in the Maryland Air National Guard, completing tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. Dean Murray was elected to represent Senate District 03 in 2022 and currently lives in his home in East Patchogue with his two dogs, Pete and Lola.
