Jake Blumencranz is an American politician from New York representing the 15th district of the New York State Assembly as a Conservative Republican. He was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 8, 2022. The 15th Assembly District includes portions of the towns of Hempstead, North Hempstead, and Oyster Bay.

Blumencranz is a resident of Oyster Bay and earned a Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy and Religious Studies from Rice University and a Master of Science in Regional Urban Planning and Economic Development from The London School of Economics. Prior to his election to the State Assembly, Blumencranz worked as a Business executive.

At 26 years old, Blumencranz won the Republican and Conservative nominations for the 15th district, defeating Democratic challenger Amanda Field with 57.8% of the vote to her 42.2% of the vote. Blumencranz emphasized that he was a Millennial, and would give a voice to the younger generation of Republicans on Long Island, and that he's "Going to put Long Island first, in the way he legislates."

Blumencranz is known for his bi-partisanship, supporting a bill which would offer $2,000 in student loan forgiveness to people who offer mental health support to the incarcerated in an effort of prison reform. Blumencranz also co-sponsored a bill with Democrat Taylor Darling which would provide EpiPen to all first responders, and not just EMTs so that the tool is available in as many places as possible. Blumencranz joined a rally against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority after they hiked taxes by $800,000,000 for his constituents, and in return cut service to many of the communities.
