As Mayor of the City of Cohoes, John focused on financial accountability, improving quality of life, and expanding economic opportunity. He pursued an aggressive economic development agenda centered on downtown revitalization, adaptive reuse of historic buildings, Hudson and Mohawk Riverfront developments, and gateway improvements.

John currently serves on the board of the Albany Convention Center Authority and is a member of the NYS Department of Financial Services Drug Accountability Board. John serves as an Executive Committee member for the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). As a member of the NYS Assembly, John serves as the Chair of the Governmental Operations Committee.
