Marjorie L. Byrnes is an American politician and attorney from the state of New York. A Republican, Byrnes has represented the 133rd district of the New York State Assembly, covering Livingston County and other areas to the south of Rochester, since 2019.

Byrnes worked as an attorney for 32 years. In that time, she served variously as a judge with the Rochester City Court, as an assistant district attorney for Monroe County, and most recently as court attorney to Livingston County Court Judge Dennis Cohen. After her retirement from the court system in 2017, Byrnes became a Caledonia Village Trustee.

In 2018, Byrnes announced that she would launch a primary challenge to Republican incumbent Joseph Errigo, who had been selected by Republican leadership for the 133rd district in 2016 following Bill Nojay's suicide. Byrnes easily defeated Errigo, with 61% of the vote to his 39%. That November, Byrnes defeated Democrat Barbara Baer with 55% of the vote. She took office on January 9, 2019.

Byrnes has lived in Caledonia for 12 years. She is a mother of two children. Her district is comprised of Livingston County and parts of Monroe, Ontario, Steuben and Wyoming counties. As Assemblywoman, Marjorie advocates for increases to state-funded infrastructure programs such as CHIPS, PAVE-NY, and BRIDGE-NY.

She has been active in recent years, attending press conferences and advocating for justice for families of nursing home residents. She has also announced grant awards from the New York State Council on the Arts to local organizations and artists in the 133rd Assembly District. Byrnes is a strong supporter of her community and is always ready to help with state issues.
