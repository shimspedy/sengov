Roxanne Persaud, born on March 1, 1966, is a Guyanese-American politician. She is a member of the Democratic party and represents the 19th district in the New York Senate. The 19th district includes portions of Canarsie, East New York, Brownsville, Mill Basin, Sheepshead Bay, Bergen Beach, Marine Park, Flatlands, Ocean Hill, and Starrett City in Brooklyn.

A native of Guyana, Persaud immigrated with her family to Brooklyn, New York, at a young age. She is of Dougla heritage, which is a mix of Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese. She graduated from Pace University with both a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Education Administration before entering a career in education.

Persaud previously served as a school administrator with Pace University and St. Francis College, Brooklyn. She was also involved with her community board in Canarsie and has served on numerous boards and commissions for the community.

In 2015, Persaud won the Democratic nomination to succeed Alan Maisel in the New York Assembly and served from January to November 2015. Later that year, Senator John Sampson was found guilty of corruption and forced to resign. Persaud, then a first-term Assemblywoman, was chosen by the Kings County Democratic Party to succeed him, and easily won the election that November to finish his term.

In 2016, Persaud faced a primary challenge from Mercedes Narcisse, who was backed by Assemblyman Charles Barron and Councilwoman Inez Barron. Persaud easily defeated Narcisse with over 75% of the vote. She went on to win re-election in 2016, 2018, and 2020.

Persaud was sworn in as state Senator on November 4, 2015. In 2019, with Democrats gaining the majority in the Senate, Persaud was named Chair of the Social Services Committee.
