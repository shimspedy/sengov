Brian A. Cunningham, born on December 16, 1984, is an American politician currently serving as a member of the New York State Assembly from the 43rd district. He assumed office on March 30, 2022, succeeding Diana Richardson.

Born and raised in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City, Cunningham's upbringing was shaped by his Jamaican immigrant parents. His personal experiences and observations of the historic lack of resources in his community inspired him to dedicate his life to public service and give back to the community that nurtured him.

Cunningham attended New York City public schools and began his career as an advocate counselor for CAMBA, assisting at-potential young people in reaching their academic goals and overcoming barriers. He has served as a senior aide in numerous legislative offices from the New York State Senate to the New York City Council, where he spearheaded initiatives for affordable housing, women�s issues, at-risk youth, and small businesses.

Returning to the nonprofit sector, Cunningham worked with Nazareth Housing on housing affordability and received the opportunity of a lifetime to serve as an aide to President Obama�s My Brother�s Keeper Alliance, mentoring and providing resources to underserved youth across the nation.

Before being elected to the New York State Assembly, Brian was the director of Neighbors in Action, a project of the Center for Court Innovation and the home of Save Our Streets Brooklyn. He currently lives in Flatbush with his wife, Stephanie.

In 2022, Cunningham endorsed Yuh-Line Niou in the 2022 election in the 10th congressional district but later rescinded his endorsement following Niou's support for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS).
