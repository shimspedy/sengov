John W. Mannion, born on July 8, 1968, is an American politician from Syracuse, New York. A member of the Democratic party, he currently serves as a member of the New York State Senate representing the 50th district. He was first elected in 2020.

Before his political career, Mannion was a biology teacher. He received a bachelor's degree in biology from Binghamton University and later attended SUNY Oswego, earning a master's of science in secondary science education. He taught AP Biology in the West Genesee Central School District, where he also served as president of the West Genesee Teachers' Association.

In the 2020 election, Mannion ran for the 50th district of the New York State Senate and won, defeating Republican Angi Renna. This victory marked the first time a Democrat held the seat in more than 50 years. The 2022 election for the 50th Senate district was hotly contested. On election night, before counting the absentee ballots, Rebecca Shiroff led by 396 votes. However, after a recount, Mannion was certified the winner by New York State Supreme Court Justice Scott Delconte. He had won the election by 10 votes, making it the closest race in the 2022 New York State Senate elections.

In 2023, Mannion announced he would be leaving the Senate to run for the 22nd Congressional District. As a senator, Mannion served as the chairperson of the Committee on Disabilities and was a member of several other committees including the Committee on Children and Families, the Committee on Civil Service and Pensions, the Committee on Education, the Committee on Environmental Conservation, the Committee on Housing, Construction and Community Development, and the Committee on Internet and Technology.

Throughout his political career, Mannion has been a strong advocate for the state’s most vulnerable citizens. He secured the first cost of living increase for Direct Support Professionals (DSPs), expanded the preferred source program to boost employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, and mandated a report by the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD) on the agency’s pandemic response. He continues to work towards solutions to address the critical workforce and housing shortages.

Mannion is also an advocate for environmental protections. He secured funds to deploy new technology to combat Harmful Algae Blooms and provide long-term protection to the drinking water supply for hundreds of thousands of Central New Yorkers. He is a strong proponent of safe, clean, nuclear power and believes it is a vital source of energy that will keep costs down for consumers as the state transitions towards its climate goals.
