Michael Tannousis is an American attorney and politician who is a member of the New York State Assembly from the 64th district. He was elected in 2020 to a term which began on January 1, 2021.

Born on December 8, 1983, Tannousis is a lifelong resident of Staten Island, New York. He is the son of Greek immigrants who came to America seeking a better life after being displaced by armed conflict in Cyprus.

Tannousis received his early education from Public School 23 and Intermediate School 24, and then attended Monsignor Farrell High School. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Binghamton University and a Juris Doctor from the Pace University School of Law.

After graduating from law school, Tannousis began his career in public service in 2006 when he was hired as an aide to former New York City Council Minority Leader James Oddo. He then served as an Assistant District Attorney in the Bronx District Attorney�s Office, where he prosecuted major felony offenses. In 2016, he took on a similar role in the Richmond County District Attorney�s office, where he successfully prosecuted serious felony cases involving violent crimes and drug sales.

In addition to his work as a prosecutor, Tannousis has also served as Counsel to City Council Member Joseph Borelli. As an experienced prosecutor, he has used his expertise to prioritize protecting the rights of victims and enact changes to recent bail and judicial discretion reforms.

Tannousis believes that the state government has lost focus on the taxpayers� best interests and is committed to making Staten Island and Brooklyn better, more affordable places to live. His goals include improvements to transportation options, education, and fighting misguided property rights laws.

Tannousis is proud of his Greek and Cypriot community roots and has previously served as a board member of the Cyprus-US Chamber of Commerce and was a delegate for the Cyprus Federation of America. He currently resides in the Great Kills neighborhood with his wife, Anna, and their morkie, Alex.
