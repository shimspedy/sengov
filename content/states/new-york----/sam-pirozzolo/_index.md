Sam Pirozzolo is an American politician from Staten Island who currently serves as a member of the New York State Assembly for the 63rd District, replacing the retiring Michael Cusick. Prior to this, he had run for several offices in the Borough and has been involved in the local Staten Island Republican Party.

Early Life and Career:
Sam is a native Staten Islander and has successfully operated his familyï¿½s optical practice for over 33 years. Along with his political career, Pirozzolo continues to work as an Optician running a private practice. He also served as the chairman of the Steinway Street Business Improvement District and was president of the Staten Island Community Education Council for seven years.

Political Career:
In 2012, during the New York state elections, Pirozzolo was the Republican nominee against Michael Cusick for the 63rd District. His campaign focused on reducing road tolls and supporting small businesses to drive economic growth. He also opposed mayor Michael Bloomberg's plan to build a trash incinerator on Staten Island.

In 2021, Pirozzolo was a candidate in the New York City Council election seeking to represent the 50th District after longtime incumbent Steven Matteo retired. His campaign gained notoriety when he erected a 16 ft "T" made of an American flag on his front lawn. The "T", which stands for Trump, was the subject of an arson attack and a $2,400 fine from the city government.

Pirozzolo was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 8, 2022. The 63rd Assembly District represents parts of Richmond County. As a member of the Legislature, Sam works to support law enforcement officers with proper funding, fix broken bail and parole policies, and help small businesses grow and thrive in a stronger, more resilient economy.
