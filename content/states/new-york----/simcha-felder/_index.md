Simcha Felder was born on December 30, 1958, in New York City, U.S. He is an American politician from Borough Park, Brooklyn. He represents the 22nd district of the New York State Senate. Felder has been elected to multiple offices as a Democrat, but is known for having caucused with the Republicans during the early part of his New York State Senate tenure.

Early in his career, Felder served as chief of staff to Democratic New York State Assembly member Dov Hikind. Felder was elected to the New York City Council in District 44 in 2001. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009. During his tenure on the City Council, Felder gained popularity among his conservative Jewish constituents for advocating strongly on their behalf and for supporting Israel.

Although personally opposed to homosexuality as being against Orthodox Judaism, he backed Christine Quinn for City Council Speaker in what was seen as a political move to gain allies. Although Felder claimed to support Quinn, he said he could not actually vote for her because of religious reasons. When the time came to vote Quinn for Council Speaker, Felder did not cast a vote and took a trip to the restroom.

Unlike nearly all other New York Democrats, Felder is a staunch opponent of abortion. Felder backed city funding for religious schools, while maintaining that he opposes displays of religion in public schools. Felder has also gained attention by calling for better labeling of caffeine content in foods and beverages, as well as a ban on the distribution of unsolicited fliers. Felder is perhaps best known for his attempt to ban the feeding of pigeons in New York City.

In 2005, Felder crossed party lines to endorse then-Republican Mike Bloomberg in his bid for reelection as New York City mayor. Felder asserted that Bloomberg was the only Republican he had ever voted for and implied that Bloomberg would be the only Republican he would ever support.

Felder was Chair of the Council's Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Siting, and Maritime uses in his first term. In January 2006, he became Chair of the Committee on Governmental Operations. As Chair of Governmental Operations, Felder supported Mayor Bloomberg's plan to curb Pay to Play contracting practices and the Mayor's bid to extend term limits so the Mayor could run for a third term.

Simcha is a Certified Public Accountant and holds a Masters of Business Administration degree in Management from the renowned Zicklin School of Business at CUNY’s Baruch College. Felder also served as a professor of Management at Touro College and CUNY’S Brooklyn College.

Felder has also served as Deputy Comptroller for Budget, Accounting, Administration and Information Technology in the New York City Comptroller’s Office. Simcha previously worked for the New York State Assembly and as a tax auditor for the New York City Department of Finance.

Before entering politics, Felder was a tireless community leader and volunteer for local civic organizations. With 17 ½ years of experience in public service, Simcha Felder was elected to the City Council in 2002. As a Council Member, Simcha built a reputation as a dedicated and committed advocate who brought concrete results home to his constituents.

He served as the Chair of the Council’s Government Operations and Sanitation and Solid Waste Management committees where he worked to bring a more rational approach to government. Simcha also chaired the Landmarks Committee. An outspoken advocate for responsible neighborhood development, Simcha worked to transform empty city-owned lots for community uses such as new housing and a Hatzolah Volunteer Ambulance garage and headquarters.

Simcha fought to secure City funding to add new playgrounds, open up and renovate schoolyards for public use, and plant thousands of new trees on city streets. While serving on the Council’s Education Committee, Simcha supported efforts to improve New York City schools through direct control and equitable funding. Simcha is a staunch advocate of school choice and maintains that the State must do more to ensure that all New York City students are treated equitably.

Simcha has a proven record as a champion of common-sense policies that streamline government and increase accountability to taxpayers. He passed laws to reduce unfair parking and sanitation tickets, sponsored the five-minute grace period legislation for motorists, and put a stop to the distribution of unwanted circulars and menus.

Felder seeks to continue his record as a legislator to make government more responsive to the needs of its citizens and break down needless and frustrating bureaucratic red-tape. As State Senator, in 2013, Felder successfully fought for and secured, funding for school transportation, enabling parents to receive fully-funded, “safety first,” door-to-door school bus services for their school children.
