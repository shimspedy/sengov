Dana Levenberg is an American politician who is a member of the New York State Assembly from the 95th district since 2023. She was first elected in 2022 and previously served as the Town Supervisor of Ossining.

Levenberg began her career working in advertising and TV production. Later, she served as Assemblywoman Sandy Galef's chief of staff and was elected to three terms on the Ossining School Board. Levenberg left Galef's office after being elected Town Supervisor of the Town of Ossining in 2015. In 2022, Galef announced she would be retiring from the New York State Assembly at the end of the year, and Levenberg entered the race to succeed her. Galef quickly endorsed her. In the Democratic primary, Levenberg won in a 3-way race against former Peekskill Common Council member and democratic socialist Vanessa Agudelo as well as Westchester County Legislator Colin Smith. In the general election, Levenberg ran against Republican Stacy Halper, a retired music teacher from Briarcliff Manor.

Levenberg attended Teaneck High School and Brown University. She married Steven Joel Hersh in West Orange, New Jersey in 1993. They chose Ossining as the place to grow their family. They were attracted to Ossining�s diverse population, excellent schools, and great Hudson River views. Both of her sons, Caleb and Eli, graduated from the Ossining School District.

Her work in the community � serving on the board of her sons� nursery school, and leading the PTA � led Dana into advocacy, public service, and then elected office. Dana�s experience as Assemblywoman Sandy Galef�s Chief of Staff, as well as nine years on the Ossining School Board, gave her the skills needed for managing staff and taxpayer dollars. During her tenure as Ossining Town Supervisor, Dana focused on building healthy communities�economically, environmentally, physically and mentally�all through a lens of equity. She kept taxes in check while working to reduce the town�s carbon footprint and improve roads, parks and open spaces.
