George Alvarez is a distinguished member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 78th District. Born in the Dominican Republic, he is of Afro-Caribbean heritage. Despite a modest upbringing, he pursued higher education and obtained a bachelor�s degree in Computer Science from one of the top-rated universities in the Dominican Republic. He furthered his education by earning a master�s degree in Logistics in Madrid, Spain. In addition to these accomplishments, he holds a Harvard Certification in Cybersecurity and has technical certifications from premier software development companies.

Raised in a single-parent home, George learned early on that the most important aspects in life are getting an education and being in service to one�s community. As a young adolescent, he was never shy to advocate for his community, and he continued to expand that role when he moved to the Bronx. His grassroots approach to addressing inequality and inequities in the borough he calls home has led him down the path of public service.

George Alvarez understands the challenges and the costs of trying to obtain the American Dream, especially for those from underserved communities like his own. These experiences and understanding inspire him to serve the residents of the 78th Assembly District to address these disparities, racial injustice, and socio-economic issues.

Educated on two continents, and a successful local entrepreneur and job creator, George is already serving the people as a Member of Community Board 1. His life�s passion is to help uplift the lifestyles of each and every constituent in his district. George has been and will continue to be a fighter for immigrant families, racial justice, affordable housing, and good jobs.

In summary, George Alvarez's journey from a modest upbringing to the Assembly House is a testament to his resilience and dedication. He is ready to fight for you.
