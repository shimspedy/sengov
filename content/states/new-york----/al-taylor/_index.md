Alfred E. Taylor, known as Al Taylor, was born on August 12, 1957, in New York City, New York, U.S. He is a lifelong resident of Harlem and a member of the Democratic Party. He is currently serving as a member of the New York State Assembly for the 71st district, which includes portions of Hamilton Heights, Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood.

Taylor had a troubled youth but was able to turn his life around with the help of Judge Bruce Wright, who mentored him and sparked his interest in community service. He served in the Military Police Corps while earning his GED. He later graduated from Lehman College and earned a Master of Divinity, with a concentration in church development, from the Alliance Theological Seminary.

Before his political career, Taylor served for many years as the chief of staff for his predecessor, Herman D. Farrell Jr., while also serving as a Democratic district leader and as the pastor of Infinity Mennonite Church.

In 2017, Farrell decided to step down midterm at the age of 85. Taylor, his chief of staff, had long been seen as the heir apparent for the seat. With Farrell vacating the seat midterm, New York state law allowed for the Democratic District committee for the Assembly district to select the candidate for the general election, bypassing a primary for the seat. Taylor, being the district leader, who ultimately leads the district committee, was easily chosen as the candidate. Taylor won the seat unopposed and was sworn in soon after. He was re-elected in 2018 after running unopposed.

Despite his achievements, Taylor has faced criticism from pro-choice and LGBT groups over his stances on abortion and gay rights. He has also been scrutinized for his involvement with a purportedly grassroots non-profit organization, "New York 4 Harlem," that actively solicited donations of $500 to $5,000. This organization was reported to allegedly have been a front for Taylor and three other Harlem elected officials. Nonprofit organizations are not allowed to take part in campaign activity.
