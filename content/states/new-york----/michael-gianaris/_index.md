Michael Gianaris, born on April 23, 1970, is an American politician and attorney hailing from Queens, New York. He is a proud representative of District 12 in the New York State Senate since 2011, following his service in the New York State Assembly from 2001 to 2010, representing District 36.

Gianaris is the son of Greek immigrants, Nicholas and Magdalene Gianaris. Born and raised in Astoria, Queens, he is a product of New York City public schools. He pursued higher education at Fordham University, graduating summa cum laude in economics and political science. He later earned a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School.

Before his political career, Gianaris served as Associate Counsel to the Committee on Consumer Affairs and Protection, Governmental Operations, Veterans Affairs, and Agriculture and Markets of the Assembly. He also worked as an aide to former Queens Congressman Thomas J. Manton and former Governor Mario Cuomo's Queens County Regional Representative. He was a member of Queens Community Planning Board 1 and Legal Counsel to the United Community Civic Association.

In 2000, Gianaris was elected to the New York State Assembly in District 36. He is a Democrat. In September 2007, he was named one of City Hall's "40 under 40". In 2010, Senator George Onorato decided not to seek re-election, and Gianaris was nominated to replace him. Gianaris easily prevailed in the District 12 election. In 2019, following Senate Democrats' ascent to the majority, Gianaris was named Deputy Majority Leader of the Senate.

Gianaris has been a progressive champion for tenants’ rights, better subways, election reforms, a fairer criminal justice system, LGBTQ+ equality, and ending unfair economic development policies. He has supported bail reform and the elimination of cash bail. In 2018, he introduced legislation to automatically register eligible voters otherwise interacting with state government. According to The Guardian, Gianaris was principally responsible for scuttling a proposal to locate Amazon's HQ2 in New York City. Gianaris has been noted for his support for antitrust enforcement, having introduced the "21st Century Antitrust Act" in the New York State Legislature and written in support of the federal American Innovation and Choice Online Act proposal.
