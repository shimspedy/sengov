Edward P. Ra, born on November 4, 1981, is a distinguished member of the New York State Assembly. He represents the 19th district, which includes portions of the towns of Hempstead, North Hempstead and Oyster Bay in Nassau County on Long Island. A dedicated member of the Republican Party, Ra was first elected in 2010.

Ra was born in Mineola, New York and raised in Franklin Square, New York, where he still resides with his wife Laura. He has a strong academic background, having earned a B.A. in computer science from Loyola College in 2004. He further pursued his education by receiving his Juris Doctor from St. John's University School of Law in 2007 and LL.M. in Intellectual Property Law from Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in 2008.

Before entering elected office, Ra served as the deputy town attorney for the Town of Hempstead, where the Town Attorney is his father, Joseph Ra. He also gained valuable experience as a legal aide in the Office of the New York State Attorney General.

In 2010, Assemblyman Thomas Alfano decided not to seek reelection, and Ra entered the race to succeed him. Ra defeated Democrat Patrick Nicolosi. Since his initial election, he has never faced serious opposition. In 2018, Ra defeated Democrat Bill Carr 55% to 45%, his closest race since the 2010 election.

As a legislator, Ra has been assigned to several committees including the Rules Committee and the Ways and Means Committee. His professional experience and dedication to public service make him a respected figure in the New York State Assembly.
