Keith Murphy is a member of the Republican Party and currently serves as a senator in the New Hampshire State Senate, representing District 16. He assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Before his tenure in the State Senate, Murphy was a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing District 7 Hillsborough from 2010 to 2018. He ran for election to the New Hampshire State Senate to represent District 16 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Murphy's educational background includes a B.A. in political science from the University of Baltimore and an M.A. in city planning from the University of Maryland.

In terms of committee assignments, as of September 2023, Murphy was assigned to the Election Law and Municipal Affairs Committee, where he serves as Vice Chair, and the Senate Ways and Means Committee. In previous legislative sessions, he served on various committees including Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services, Commerce and Consumer Affairs, and Ways and Means.

In the general election for New Hampshire State Senate District 16, Murphy defeated June Trisciani, securing 53.3% of the votes. The race had no incumbents and the results have been certified.

Outside of his political career, Murphy is also known as an American restaurateur. However, his career has not been without controversy. On June 19, 2023, Murphy surrendered himself to the Manchester Police Department on a charge of assaulting one of his employees.
