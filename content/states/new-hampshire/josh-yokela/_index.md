Josh Yokela, born on December 17, 1986, is an American Republican legislator who was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives on November 6, 2018. He was elected to represent Rockingham 33 district which includes the towns of Brentwood, Danville, and Fremont.

Yokela was born in Fremont, California, U.S. He grew up in California but didn't feel at home with excessive government rules and regulations. He moved to New Hampshire because he felt the spirit of freedom throughout New Hampshire's history and feels it is still alive today and is much more compatible with what he believes is the proper role of government.

In terms of his professional life, Yokela's career experience includes working as a business intelligence analyst with Campers Inn RV, an assistant bookkeeper with KBW Financial Staffing & Recruiting, and a vendor invoice processor with Dunn Lumber. He has served on the Fremont Budget Committee and the Fremont Zoning Board of Adjustment.

In the political sphere, Yokela has been quite active. He sponsored HB567 which would switch New Hampshire to the Atlantic Time Zone if Maine and Massachusetts agreed to move to the Atlantic Time Zone, too. This is a proposed solution to get around the Federal restriction against accepting Daylight Saving Time all year round. The bill passed the House of Representatives in 2019 with a vote of 208'120, but was not supported by the Senate.

He also sponsored HB317 in 2019 which aims to end the restriction on aftermarket tinting of car windows to the right and left of the driver for people without a medical waiver. New Hampshire is one of three states that do not allow any aftermarket tint on the front side windows of a car. HB317 passed the New Hampshire House and was tabled by the Senate. The issue of tinting front side windows of a car was taken back up by him in 2021 in HB 224 and was passed into law and went into effect on 10/9/2021.

Also in 2021, Josh Yokela sponsored three other bills which were signed into New Hampshire law, HB 258 permitting wage and hour records to be approved and retained electronically, HB 208 repealing RSA 323 regarding lightning rod dealers and salesmen, and HB 566 relative to the discussion of disclosure of the minutes from a nonpublic session under the right-to-know law.

Yokela is currently a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Rockingham 32. He assumed office on December 7, 2022. His current term ends on December 4, 2024.
