As a single parent, Chretien raised two sons who attended Manchester Public Schools and later pursued higher education at the University of New Hampshire. Her family values and personal experiences have shaped her approach to policymaking, emphasizing the importance of education, community support, and collaboration.

In her role as a state representative, Chretien is a member of the Education Funding Committee, where she works to address critical issues affecting schools and students across the state. She is committed to fostering bipartisan cooperation, listening to diverse perspectives, and finding common ground to create meaningful change for her constituents.
