Michael O'Brien is an American politician who has dedicated his life to public service. He serves as a Democratic member for the Hillsborough 10th district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. His political journey has been marked by dedication and commitment to his constituents. O'Brien's political career began when he was first elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2008. Despite losing re-election in 2010, he remained undeterred and was reelected in 2012. Since then, he has continued to serve his constituents with dedication and integrity.

In addition to his role in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, O'Brien also serves as a Nashua, New Hampshire Alderman. His leadership skills were recognized when he was elected Vice President of Nashua's Board of Aldermen in January 2024.

Throughout his political career, O'Brien has served on several committees. He has been a member of the Executive Departments and Administration Committee and the Transportation Committee. When Democrats had control of the house during the 2019-2020 biennium, O'Brien served as Vice Chair of the Transportation Committee. Like many politicians, O'Brien's career has not been without controversy. In January 2024, John Formella, the Attorney General of New Hampshire, accused O'Brien, two other aldermen, and the Mayor of Nashua of violating the state's anti-electioneering statute. Formella issued an order instructing the four politicians to cease and desist from violating the law.

Despite these challenges, O'Brien continues to serve his constituents with dedication and integrity. His commitment to public service is evident in his ongoing work as a representative and alderman.
