Joseph Edmund "Jeb" Bradley III was born on October 20, 1952. He is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party who serves in the New Hampshire Senate. He represents his hometown of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and 16 other towns in east-central New Hampshire for District 3.

Bradley was born in Rumford, Maine, to Helen Jockers Bradley and Joseph Edmund Bradley, Jr. After graduating from Governor Dummer Academy, he attended Tufts University, graduating in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts with a major in sociology.

Before his political career, Bradley lived in Switzerland and worked as a street magician. He returned to New Hampshire in 1981, where he later opened an organic grocery called Evergrain Natural Foods. He and his wife sold the natural foods store in 1997. He also ran a painting business and managed real estate.

Bradley was elected to the Wolfeboro Planning Board in 1986; three years later, he was named to the Budget Committee. He was a registered Democrat until 1989, when he switched to the Republican party.

Bradley won a seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives in November 1990 and was re-elected five times. In the legislature, he sponsored the Clean Power Act, which set limits on power plant emissions. He was chairman of the Science, Technology and Energy Committee, as well as the Joint Committee on Ethics.

He served as the U.S. representative for New Hampshire's 1st congressional district from 2003 to 2007. He was Majority Leader of the New Hampshire Senate from 2010 to 2018 and again from 2020 to 2022.

Currently, he is the President of the New Hampshire Senate, a position he assumed on December 7, 2022. He has been a member of the New Hampshire Senate since April 21, 2009, representing District 3. His current term ends on December 4, 2024.
