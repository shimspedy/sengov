Sanborn served in the House previously, representing Merrimack 5 from 2010 until her resignation on June 5, 2012. She and her husband, state senator Andy Sanborn, resigned after they moved out of their respective districts to settle in Bedford.

In 2023, Sanborn resigned as chairwoman of the Commission to Study the Effect of Recent Changes Made to the Charitable Gaming Laws.

Sanborn was born in Nashua, New Hampshire. Her career experience includes working in human resources and operations for New Hampshire corporations. She has also volunteered on the board of directors for the American Red Cross, the Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce, and the Business Finance Authority.

In terms of committee assignments, Sanborn has been assigned to various committees over the years. In the 2023-2024 legislative session, she was assigned to the Rules Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, where she served as Chair. In the 2021-2022 session, she was assigned to the Rules Committee. In the 2019-2020 session, she was assigned to the Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee.
