Karen Calabro is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough 45. She assumed office on December 7, 2022. Her current term ends on December 4, 2024. Calabro ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Hillsborough 45 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Karen Calabro lives in Hollis, New Hampshire. She has lived in New Hampshire for twenty-two years, most recently practicing primary care and addiction medicine to the homeless and less resourced in the Southern NH area. She served as a Mobile Crisis medical lead, and QA Medical Lead to Harbor Homes until Summer 2022.

Before her career in medicine, Calabro was a certified Chef, General Manager, Food & Beverage Director, and marketing consultant, retiring after 23 years in 2006. She earned a master's of physician assistant studies at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in 2015.

Calabro and her family are deeply involved in community events and behind the scenes supports for the most vulnerable. They also engage in hiking, mountain climbing, water sports, winter sports (all), and the fine arts locally. They have three children, two adults and one still in public schools.

In her role as a legislator, Calabro is a member of the Committee on Transportation. The committee considers all matters pertaining to development, operation and regulation of all means of air, land and water transportation, except for the capital improvement and repair of public highways; the motor vehicle code; and such other matters as may be referred to it.

Calabro has also represented the USA, OH as Rotary Exchange Student to Australia in 1983-4, as the first group to do so from this nation, at the age of 15. She has prior training in Descalation techniques, Behavioral emergencies, and Conflict resolution/negotiation, Peacekeepers. She is typically brought into what is referred to as a Code Grey (aka behavioral emergency). This makes her a good person to mediate between two very strong personas. She is also good with fundraising and networking.
