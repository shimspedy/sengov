Jim Kofalt's family first moved to New Hampshire in 1998 and settled in Wilton a few years later. Since then, he has served on the Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School Board, where he is currently the Chair. Prior to being elected to the Board, he was also a member of the Budget Committee. His focus has always been on providing quality education, seeking to get the best possible value for their money.

He has been a strong proponent of medical freedom, the 2nd Amendment, free speech, property rights, and free-market economics. He sponsored House Bill 440,  legislation that preserves civil liberties during a declared state of emergency, assuring that Constitutional rights may not be limited or suspended by a New Hampshire governor.

In 2022, he sponsored bills aimed at establishing 50/50 shared parenting as the default presumption in divorce cases, and a bill that would have limited the power of DHHS to impose new vaccine mandates on children. He has co-sponsored legislation that would have enabled patients in New Hampshire to obtain Ivermectin, a bill to extend Constitutional Carry to include snowmobiles, and legislation aimed at shoring up election integrity.

Jim Kofalt earned a B.S. in Russian from Georgetown University in 1987 and an M.B.A. from Syracuse University in 2008. His career experience includes working as the president of DX4 Research, a program manager with SAP, and a technical product manager with Microsoft.
