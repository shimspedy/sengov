Lily Foss is a fourth-generation Manchester native whose family has called the Queen City home since 1905.  Growing up in Ward 7, she received an excellent public school education at Hallsville Elementary School, McLaughlin Middle School, and Memorial High School.  After graduating from Scripps College in Claremont, California with a degree in Politics & International Relations, she served as an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer working on fighting childhood hunger in the Granite State.

After moving to Philadelphia from 2015-2018 to attend Temple University School of Law, Lily discovered that the call of her home state was too powerful to ignore and moved back to New Hampshire to stay.  She realized that her true passion is for improving the lives of Granite Staters through progressive policy and action.  

While Lily may come from a family with strong Manchester ties, she sees that the Manchester where she, her mother, her grandmother, and her great-grandmother grew up no longer exists.  With skyrocketing housing prices, constant attacks on bodily freedoms, and healthcare that is unaffordable and inaccessible to so many, today’s Granite Staters live in harrowing times.  A changing world calls for a change in viewpoint, and Lily is excited to talk to voters about how they can build Manchester’s future together.
