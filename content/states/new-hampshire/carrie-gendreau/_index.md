Carrie Gendreau is a distinguished member of the New Hampshire State Senate, representing District 1. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024. She is a member of the Republican Party.

Born and raised in Littleton, New Hampshire, Gendreau has a deep connection with her hometown. She graduated from Littleton High School and went on to earn a degree in business from Bob Jones University in South Carolina.

Before her political career, Gendreau had a diverse professional background. She worked in insurance sales, served as a teacher, and was a business owner. These experiences have given her a broad perspective on the needs and challenges of her constituents.

Gendreau's political journey began at the local level, where she served as a member of the Littleton Board of Selectmen. Her dedication to public service and her leadership skills soon led her to run for a seat in the New Hampshire State Senate.

In the general election held on November 8, 2022, Gendreau won the seat for the New Hampshire State Senate District 1. Her victory was a testament to her popularity and the trust placed in her by the people of her district.

As a senator, Gendreau has been assigned to several committees, including the Senate Education Committee, the Senate Executive Departments and Administration Committee, and the Senate Transportation Committee. Her work in these committees reflects her commitment to improving education, streamlining administration, and enhancing transportation facilities in her district.

Gendreau is known for her strong faith. She is a self-identified evangelical Christian and often carries a Bible with her to debates in the New Hampshire Senate. She once stated, "I will listen to my constituents, but if the Lord trumps the majority, I will go with that."

Despite the challenges and controversies she has faced, Gendreau remains steadfast in her commitment to serve the people of New Hampshire. Her journey from a local board member to a state senator is a testament to her dedication, resilience, and leadership.
