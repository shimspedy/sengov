Sherman Adams Packard was born on February 25, 1949, in Manchester, New Hampshire. He was named after former New Hampshire governor Sherman Adams. His father was Norman A. Packard, a former President of the New Hampshire Senate. By profession, he is an automobile upholsterer.

Packard's political career began when he was first elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1990, representing the Rockingham 5 district. He has been serving in the House ever since. Over the years, he has held several key positions in the House.

In the 2008-2010 legislative session, Packard was elected by the New Hampshire House of Representatives Republican caucus to serve as minority leader. In 2010, after Republicans flipped the chamber, Packard declined to be a candidate for the Republican nomination for the speakership.

During the 2010-2012 legislative session, Bill O'Brien, a Conservative Tea Party supporter, was elected speaker, having defeated the more moderate representative Gene Chandler, an ally of Packard, for the nomination in an upset. O'Brien appointed Packard chair of the transportation committee for the session.

In December 2014, for the 2014-2016 session, Packard was appointed speaker pro tempore, the house's third-ranking presiding officer, by speaker Shawn Jasper. He was also appointed vice chair of the legislative administration committee.

In November 2017, after the resignation of Speaker Shawn Jasper to serve as New Hampshire Commissioner of Agriculture, Packard was appointed deputy speaker, the house's second-ranking presiding officer, by newly elected speaker Gene Chandler, the previous deputy speaker.

He lost his post as deputy speaker when Democrats flipped the house in the 2018 elections. However, he began serving as acting state House speaker upon Dick Hinch's death on December 9, 2020. He was officially elected House speaker on January 6, 2021.

Apart from his political career, Packard lives in Londonberry, New Hampshire. His career experience includes owning a small business. He has also served as a member of the New Hampshire Motorcycle Rights Organization.
