Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, born in September 1982, is an American politician who has been serving in the New Hampshire Senate from the 21st district since 2020. Her district encompasses Portsmouth, Durham, Newmarket, Lee, Newfields, Madbury, and Newington. She has the distinction of being the first openly LGBTQ+ woman elected to the New Hampshire Senate.

Rebecca is not just a politician, but also a mom, a green energy lawyer, and a life-long public servant. Her journey through law school, the Peace Corps, and her time on City Council has made it clear to her that implementing legislative solutions and supporting change are not only good for our communities, but a necessary part of growing our economy and livelihoods.

As the partner to her truly incredible wife and as a mom of two, Rebecca has lived through the flaws in our healthcare and economy. She understands as a woman that her rights need to be fought for within her State government; and that there are thousands of Granite State women and queer people who need the same.

Rebecca grew up at her family's Dairy Queen, running their small business. By 15, she was managing employees and working 30+ hours each week while her peers at Phillips Exeter Academy explored sports or the arts. Her love for the community started here.

Her education and experience have taught her about what New Hampshire's needs next: a restoration of our Main Street communities, through sound housing and energy policies, attracting and retaining our next generation of workers and keeping our economy healthy for all. We shouldn't have to fight for civil and human rights for all, cleaner air and drinking water, and a quality of life no matter the color of your skin, your gender, or who you love - but we will, and through it bring the State a lasting, healthy prosperity.
