John Joseph Stone is a Democratic Party member serving in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He represents Strafford District 12, having assumed office on December 4, 2024. His current term is set to conclude on December 2, 2026.

John Stone's journey to public service is rooted in a life of dedication and resilience. Born and raised in Gloucester, Massachusetts, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam War, serving in a reconnaissance unit in Cambodia and Laos. His military service was marked by bravery and sacrifice, as he was one of only eight soldiers in his 42-man unit to return home after deployment.

After his military service, John pursued a career in construction, working alongside his father and brother. He also earned an engineering degree from Boston Technical High School. In 1977, he moved to New Hampshire, where he continued his work in the construction industry, supporting his family and contributing to the Seacoast area's development. Despite facing health challenges at the age of 48 that forced him to step away from his career as a building contractor, John remained committed to his community. During his recovery, he received support from the Community Action Program, an experience that deepened his desire to give back.

Today, John Stone is not only a State Representative but also an active member of his community. He cares for the grounds of his homeownersâ€™ association and frequently assists neighbors and friends with home improvement projects. His candidacy has been supported by organizations like the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local Union No. 63 in Manchester.

John is passionate about addressing key issues that affect his constituents. He advocates for bringing back well-paying manufacturing jobs to New Hampshire, making housing more affordable for working families, and creating a dignified work environment. He is also committed to adequately funding public education and providing affordable recreational opportunities for Granite Staters and their families. His dedication to these causes reflects his deep commitment to improving the quality of life for the people he represents.
