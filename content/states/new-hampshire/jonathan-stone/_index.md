Jonathan Stone is an American politician who serves as a Republican member for the Sullivan 8th district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He assumed office on December 7, 2022.

Born and raised in Claremont, New Hampshire, Stone's career experience includes working for the Sullivan County Department of Corrections, the State of New Hampshire Judicial Branch, the City of Claremont Police Department, and the State of Vermont Department of Corrections. He also volunteered with the Vermont State Employees Association and on with AFSCME Local 3657.

Before assuming his current office, Stone served as a police officer for the City of Claremont Police Department for six years. During his time as a police officer, there were at least 14 internal affairs reports regarding Stone's conduct. He resigned from the Claremont Police in 2007.

Stone ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2020 and was defeated by incumbent John Cloutier. However, he was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in November 2022. He currently has a seat on the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee.

In addition to his political career, Stone is a co-owner of a gun shop called Black Op Arms in Claremont.

Despite his achievements, Stone's career has not been without controversy. While serving as a police officer, he was investigated for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old girl. Stone threatened to rape his supervisor's wife and children and murder his supervisor as a result of the investigation. He also made threats against fellow police officers. The file was kept private until a journalist requested the files under New Hampshire's right-to-know laws.
