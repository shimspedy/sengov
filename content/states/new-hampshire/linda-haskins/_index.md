Born and raised in Exeter, New Hampshire, Linda has always been an active member of her community.

These experiences have undoubtedly shaped her worldview and influenced her work as a representative.

Upon retiring, Linda returned to Exeter, where she continues to serve her community. She is also active in her church, where she serves on a resettlement team for a Ukrainian family. This work, along with her other endeavors, highlights Linda's compassion and dedication to helping others.
