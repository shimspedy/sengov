Born and raised in West Haven, Connecticut, Lynn moved to New Hampshire in 1978. He earned a B.S. in criminal justice from the University of New Haven in 1971, graduating magna cum laude. He then went on to earn a J.D. with high honors from the University of Connecticut School of Law in 1975, where he served as the executive editor of the Connecticut Law Review.

Before his political career, Lynn had a diverse professional background. He worked as a special agent with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. He also served as a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Lynn's political career began when he was first appointed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court as an associate justice. He was nominated by Governor John Lynch in 2010. In February 2018, Governor Chris Sununu nominated him to serve as the 36th Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court. He was confirmed by the New Hampshire Executive Council and was sworn in on April 9, 2018. He served as the chief justice until his retirement on August 23, 2019.

In the 2022 general election, Lynn ran for re-election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Rockingham 17. He won the election, securing his current position. During his tenure, he has been assigned to several committees, including the House Judiciary Committee, which he chairs.
