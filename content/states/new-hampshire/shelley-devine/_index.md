Shelley Devine is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough 5. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Before her political career, Shelley earned a B.A. in commercial art from Notre Dame College in Manchester, New Hampshire. She is also a small business owner, which gives her a unique perspective on the needs and challenges of the business community in New Hampshire.

Shelley never thought of herself as a political person, let alone a politician. For much of her life, she voted for candidates based on platform, not party. However, watching her home state grapple with changing gun safety and women's health policies, Shelley realized the need for a new type of leadership in the statehouse.

As a mom and a Nashua native, Shelley has a deep understanding of what matters to Granite Staters. Her commitment to New Hampshire values are not a partisan agenda makes her the right voice for Nashua. Her priorities include sensible gun safety, women's health & rights, funding public education, affordable housing, economy and talent retention, and energy and the environment.

Shelley ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Hillsborough 5 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. She is dedicated to working across party lines to tackle the issues that matter most to the communities in New Hampshire.
