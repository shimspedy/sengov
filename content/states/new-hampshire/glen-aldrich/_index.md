Glen Aldrich is a dedicated public servant and a prominent figure in New Hampshire politics. Born on December 20, 1957, he has spent much of his life contributing to his community and advocating for the values he holds dear. A graduate of Shawnee High School, Aldrich has always been deeply rooted in his principles and committed to making a difference.

Aldrich began his political career in 2014 when he was first elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives.

Despite his dedication, Aldrich faced challenges in his political journey. In 2022, he was defeated in the Republican primary, temporarily stepping away from his role in the House. However, his commitment to public service remained unwavering, and he returned to the political arena in 2024, successfully winning a seat in the Belknap 6 district. His resilience and determination have been a testament to his dedication to his community and his principles.

Outside of his political career, Aldrich is a family man who values his personal life. He is married and has three children, and he resides in Gilford, New Hampshire.
