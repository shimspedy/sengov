Matt Wilhelm is a Democratic member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough District 21. He assumed office on December 4, 2024, and his current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Matt Wilhelm has dedicated his career to public service and community engagement. He grew up in Nashua, New Hampshire, and pursued higher education at Plymouth State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in communication studies and political science. He later obtained a master's degree in public administration from the University of New Hampshire's Carsey School of Public Policy.

Before entering politics, Wilhelm worked extensively in the nonprofit sector, focusing on initiatives that fostered community development and volunteerism. He served as a managing member of Make It Better, LLC, and as the director of Old Sol Alliance, Inc. His work often revolved around uniting diverse teams of board members, staff, volunteers, and stakeholders to address challenges and implement meaningful solutions.

Wilhelm's commitment to service extended to his involvement with AmeriCorps, where he served as a team leader in under-resourced public schools through City Year New Hampshire. He also chaired New Hampshire's Service Year Workforce Commission during the 2019-2020 legislative session, further demonstrating his dedication to empowering communities.

In addition to his legislative duties, Wilhelm is actively involved in various boards and organizations, including Volunteer NH and Calling All Crows. He and his wife, Jody, operate a dormitory-style housing complex for AmeriCorps members in Manchester, New Hampshire. Together, they are proud parents to two children, Ben and Rosie, and share their home with their pets, Spencer the cat and Hope the puppy.

As a legislator, Wilhelm has focused on issues such as election law, campaign finance, and redistricting, serving on relevant committees to address these matters. His leadership and collaborative approach have made him a respected figure in New Hampshire's political landscape.
