Brandon Phinney, born on April 27, 1988, is an American politician and a former member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, where he represented Strafford County's 24th district. He was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, and currently resides in Rochester, New Hampshire.

Phinney earned his associate degree from Great Bay Community College and his bachelor's degree from Southern New Hampshire University. In 2016, he was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives as a Republican, beating his Democratic opponent by just 116 votes. He became notable in atheist circles as the only openly atheist Republican legislator in the United States.

On June 27, 2017, he announced in a press conference that he had changed his party affiliation to Libertarian. However, Phinney was defeated for re-election in a three-way race, finishing in third place with 10% of the total vote. He was succeeded by Republican Mona Perreault. Following his defeat, he announced he would run for Rochester City Council in 2019.

Despite the setback, Phinney was elected to the State House again in 2022. He currently represents Strafford 9 and assumed office on December 7, 2022. His current term ends on December 4, 2024.

In addition to his political career, Phinney served in the New Hampshire Army National Guard and has worked as a corrections officer. His commitment to public service is evident in his diverse career and his dedication to the people of New Hampshire.
