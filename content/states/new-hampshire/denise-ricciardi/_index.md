Denise Ricciardi, a tenacious and hardworking individual, is a notable figure in the political landscape of New Hampshire. Born on December 16, 1961, in a diverse suburb of Philadelphia, Denise was instilled with a strong work ethic from an early age by her father, a middle-class engineer who put himself through college with help from the GI Bill.

Denise's journey into the professional world began at the tender age of 14 when she took up her first paying job waiting tables. The money she earned from this job was used to buy school clothes, demonstrating her independence and determination from a young age.

After completing her college education, Denise joined a company specializing in insurance for long-term care and Medicare supplement plans. Her quick grasp of the industry and her entrepreneurial spirit led her to establish her own business in Nashua. Her company, which specialized in policies for seniors, quickly grew and expanded its services to aid non-profit groups such as the New Hampshire Association for the Blind and the American Red Cross by providing insurance for its members.

In 1997, after selling her business and marrying her husband, Giorgio, Denise moved to Bedford and started her family. Always an active community volunteer, Denise has been involved in numerous activities in Bedford. These include cooking and delivering meals to new mothers with the Bedford Newcomers Club, raising money for the playground at Memorial School, teaching Sunday school at Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral, producing a cooking show for Bedford Community TV, substitute teaching in the Bedford schools, and teaching cooking classes for the Bedford Parks and Recreation Department.

Denise's political journey began when she discovered that a cell phone tower was proposed to be placed close to an elementary school near her home. With the help of many other Bedford residents, she waged a long, uphill battle, until the cell phone company eventually withdrew their proposal. Her leadership on this issue led Governor Chris Sununu to appoint her in 2019 to the state's 5G Health Study Commission, which is tasked with determining any potential hazards of further expansion.

In the same year, she was elected to the Bedford Town Council, where she served a 3-year term and was elected Vice Chairman. Through the hard work of the council and responsible budgeting, the town of Bedford has maintained a AAA bond rating from Moody's. As a member of the town council, she served on the Conservation Commission, Telecommunications Commission, and Highway and Safety Commission, tasked with planning and budgeting for all of the town's infrastructure projects.

In 2020, Denise represented the 9th district of the New Hampshire Senate, defeating Democratic incumbent Jeanne Dietsch. Her political career continues to flourish as she serves the people of New Hampshire with dedication and commitment.
