Born on February 17, 1966, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Terry Spahr has had a diverse and impactful career. He graduated from The Haverford School and later earned a bachelor's degree in American History from the University of Pennsylvania in 1988. During his time at Penn, he was an accomplished squash player, achieving All-American recognition. He furthered his education by obtaining a master's degree in Public Administration from the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania in 1996.

Spahr began his professional journey in the financial services industry, where he sold insurance and investment products. He earned several certifications, including CLU and CHFC designations. Later, he transitioned into the real estate sector, acquiring his Virginia Real Estate sales license in 1996. He joined Long & Foster Real Estate, where he climbed the ranks to become a regional vice president, overseeing numerous offices and agents across multiple states.

In 2016, Spahr shifted his focus to environmental advocacy. He wrote and produced "8 Billion Angels," an award-winning documentary addressing environmental and human health issues. This endeavor led him to establish Earth Overshoot, a nonprofit organization dedicated to sustainability education and advocacy. As the Executive Director of Earth Overshoot, Spahr has become a prominent voice in sustainability, engaging in lectures, media appearances, and activist campaigns.

In 2024, Spahr entered the political arena, successfully running for a seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. His campaign focused on preserving the quality of life in his district, protecting reproductive freedom, and ensuring responsible funding for public education.

He is an active member of his community, participating in organizations such as the Hanover Conservancy and the Upper Valley Seed Savers. He is also an instructor at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Dartmouth.
