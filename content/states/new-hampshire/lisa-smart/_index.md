Lisa Smart is a dedicated professional with a rich and diverse background, encompassing healthcare, real estate, and agriculture. A mother of four adult children and grandmother of four, she recently retired after a 20-year career in Diagnostic Imaging.

Lisa's educational journey began in 2000 when she earned her Associate of Science degree in Radiologic Technology from NHTI, graduating with a commendable GPA of 3.8. She holds licensure in MRI, X-Ray, and Mammography, reflecting her extensive expertise in the field.

In addition to her healthcare career, Lisa is a licensed Realtor in New Hampshire, currently affiliated with Coldwell Banker in Gilford, NH. Her professional path also includes running her own house-cleaning business prior to attending NHTI, which provided the flexibility to balance work and family life. 

Before transitioning to house cleaning, Lisa spent 16 years as an animal health technician at a local animal hospital. This role allowed her to delve deeply into various aspects of medical science, from office visit protocols and ethics to lab tests and IV administration. Her broad healthcare experience extended into human health care, where she gained valuable insights into insurance processes, including coding, diagnosis, and medical orders.

Lisa resides in Meredith, NH, with her husband in a historic 150-year-old farmhouse. They are passionate about sustainable living, raising their own livestock and maintaining a large vegetable garden, which they share with neighbors and family. Their efforts in food preservation help sustain them through the winter months.

Although this is Lisa's first venture into political office, she has been a dedicated voter since the age of 18. She believes her extensive healthcare experience offers a unique perspective that would be beneficial to the Health and Human Services Committee. Additionally, her hands-on experience in agriculture makes her a valuable asset to the Environment and Agriculture Committee. Lisa is enthusiastic about the opportunity to work on any committee, committed to research and collaboration, and eager to meet new colleagues and expand her knowledge.

Lisa Smart's broad spectrum of experiences and her commitment to community involvement highlight her as a versatile and capable candidate for public office.
