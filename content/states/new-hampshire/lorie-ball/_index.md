Lorie Ball is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Rockingham 25. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024. She ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Rockingham 25 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Lorie Ball earned an M.Ed. in emotional and behavioral disabilities from Rivier University. She graduated Summa Cum Laude and was certified as a Reading and Writing Specialist in 2011. Most recently, Lorie was accepted into the Education in Leadership and Learning Doctoral Program in 2018.

Although recently retired from teaching, Lorie was certified in NH in the following areas of education: Elementary Education (K-8), General Special Education (K-12), Emotional Behavioral Specialist, and Reading and Writing Specialist (with emphasis on dyslexia). Lorie is well-versed in the Science of Reading and trained in Orton-Gillingham, Wilson, and Lindamood Phoneme Sequencing Program (LiPS) reading programs - as well as other lesser-known reading and writing programs. While working as a middle school Special Education teacher, Lorie taught students in 11 of the 13 areas of special education.

Prior to COVID-19, Lorie was self-employed as an Educational Advocate. This experience allowed Lorie to attend many Special Education Team meetings in southern New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts schools. It also gave Lorie insight into how different school districts approach general education instruction as well as specialized instruction.

Although never elected to other local government positions, Lorie has been very active in her local community through involvement in the Salem Area Women's Club (Treasurer), the Greater Salem Rotary Club, the Salem Lions Club, and the Derry-Salem Elks Lodge.

Lorie has spent the last 30 years fighting to change how reading is taught in NH schools. In March 2022, persistent state-wide low proficiency scores in reading, math, and science inspired Lorie to run for the Salem School Board. Although she earned the votes of 1,630 Salem residents, the final tally fell short of exceeding the votes of her twenty-one-year incumbent opponent by 74 votes. Not to be discouraged, Lorie ran for one of the nine Salem State Representative seats and is now serving her first term in the State House.
