Jean Jeudy is a Democratic member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough District 23. He assumed office on December 18, 2024, and his current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Born in Jérémie, Haiti, in 1958, Jean Jeudy emigrated to the United States in 1983 after being inspired by the political freedoms he observed during a visit. He settled in New Hampshire and became a U.S. citizen in 1995. His journey into public service began after a back injury in 1993, which motivated him to give back to his community. He founded the Manchester Haitian Community Center and served on the boards of organizations like the United Way and Manchester Public-access television.

Jeudy's political career took off in 2005 when he became the first Haitian-American legislator in New Hampshire's history. Over the years, he has been an active participant in legislative committees, including the State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee. Beyond politics, Jeudy has worked as a journalist and hosted TV Palmiste, showcasing his dedication to communication and community engagement.

His story is one of resilience and commitment, reflecting his passion for serving both his local community and the broader public.
