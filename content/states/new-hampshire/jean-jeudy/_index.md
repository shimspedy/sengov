Jean Leniol Jeudy, born in 1958, is a prominent figure in American politics. He is one of the three members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives for Hillsborough 10, which includes Ward 3 in Manchester.

Born in Jeremie, Haiti, Jeudy moved to the United States in 1983, two years after his vacation to the country. He was deeply inspired by the political freedom in the United States, which led him to make this life-changing decision. He gained his American citizenship in 1995.

Before entering politics, Jeudy faced a debilitating back injury in 1993. This incident inspired him to give back to his adopted community. He founded the Manchester Haitian Community Center and served on the Board of Directors for the local United Way, as well as for the Manchester Public-access television station.

In 2004, Jeudy decided to run for State Representative. Although he finished 5th in the Democratic Primary, falling short by 53 votes to Manchester Firefighters Union president William Clayton, he did not give up. After Clayton's resignation in 2005, Jeudy ran again and defeated his Republican opponent, Robert Fremeau, with a vote count of 508 to 322. This victory marked Jeudy as the first Haitian-American legislator in New Hampshire history.

Apart from his political career, Jeudy has also worked as a journalist and the host of TV Palmiste. His career experience and dedication to serving the community have made him a respected figure in New Hampshire politics.
