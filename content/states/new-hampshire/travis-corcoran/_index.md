Travis Corcoran is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough 44. He assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Travis Corcoran graduated from Cornell University in 1993 with a double major in Computer Science and History. After graduation, he embarked on a diverse career path. He has worked at a variety of software startups, in addition to running his own firm for 14 years. His entrepreneurial spirit and technical expertise have been instrumental in his professional journey.

In addition to his work in the tech industry, Corcoran is also an accomplished author. He has published several novels, winning the Prometheus Award for best libertarian science fiction twice. His non-fiction books have also garnered attention, showcasing his ability to articulate complex ideas in an accessible manner.

Beyond his professional endeavors, Corcoran is a dedicated farmer. He works on his farm in Weare, where he has lived with his wife for ten years. This connection to the land and the local community has deeply influenced his perspective and values.

Corcoran's interest in local government was sparked by witnessing first-hand corruption, conflicts of interest, violations of RSA 91-A, secret meetings, falsified meeting minutes, and more in Weare. After having defeated one warrant article and filed four lawsuits to fight local corruption, he decided to head to Concord to make a difference at the state level.

In the 2022 general election, Corcoran ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Hillsborough 44. He won the election, marking the beginning of his political career. As a representative, he is committed to serving his constituents and working towards a transparent and accountable government.
