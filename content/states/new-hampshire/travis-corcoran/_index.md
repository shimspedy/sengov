Travis Corcoran is not only a politician but also an accomplished author and entrepreneur. He graduated from Cornell University in 1993 with a double major in Computer Science and History. Over the years, he has worked in various software startups and even ran his own firm for 14 years. His entrepreneurial ventures include founding SmartFlix, an online video rental service specializing in instructional videos, and HeavyInk, an online comic book retailer. Both businesses showcased his innovative spirit and commitment to niche markets.

As an author, Corcoran has made significant contributions to the science fiction genre. His novels, "The Powers of the Earth" and "Causes of Separation," have both won the prestigious Prometheus Award for best libertarian science fiction. In addition to his fiction work, he has written non-fiction, including a homesteading manual titled "Escape the City," aimed at helping urban dwellers transition to rural living.

Corcoran resides in Weare, New Hampshire, where he manages a small farm with his wife. His interest in local governance was sparked by witnessing instances of corruption and ethical violations in his community. This motivated him to take an active role in fighting for transparency and accountability, eventually leading him to pursue a position in the state legislature.

In the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Corcoran has been an advocate for education reform, supporting initiatives like the Education Freedom Account school voucher program. He has also taken clear stances on issues such as drug policy, climate change, and abortion laws, reflecting his libertarian-leaning political philosophy. His legislative work often emphasizes individual freedoms and limited government intervention.

Corcoran's multifaceted career and dedication to public service highlight his commitment to both his constituents and his personal principles. His journey from software engineer to state representative underscores his adaptability and drive to make a meaningful impact in various spheres of life.
