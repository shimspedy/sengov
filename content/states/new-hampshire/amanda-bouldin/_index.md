Amanda Bouldin, born on December 27, 1984, is an American politician hailing from Manchester, New Hampshire. She has been serving in the New Hampshire House of Representatives since January 2015. As a Democrat, she represents Hillsborough County's 12th district.

In her early political career, Bouldin introduced two significant bills addressing heroin use in New Hampshire. The first bill, HB 270, provided legal protection against arrest and prosecution for individuals calling for medical assistance for someone with an opiate-related medical problem. The second bill, HB 271, relaxed restrictions on prescribing naloxone, granting authorized health care professionals the power to write a prescription for anyone at risk of an opiate overdose or for a person who knows someone at risk of an opiate overdose.

In December 2015, Bouldin made headlines when she commented on Facebook that a proposed change in New Hampshire's public nudity law that would have allowed men to expose their nipples in public while prohibiting women from doing the same was sexist. This comment drew crude comments about Bouldin's breasts from two Republican representatives, Josh Moore and Al Baldasaro.

In 2023, Bouldin assumed the role of New Hampshire Organizing and Recruitment Associate at Run for Something, a progressive political organization that recruits and supports young, diverse progressives to run for down-ballot races in order to build a bench for the future.

Apart from her political career, Bouldin is also a proud mom to a Manchester Community College student, two dogs, and one cat. She has spent years volunteering, providing meals and clothing to Manchester families in need. Her priorities include criminal justice reform, addressing homelessness, and alleviating Manchester's housing crisis.

Bouldin is also known for her presence on social media platforms like TikTok, where she shares her thoughts and experiences as a mother and a politician. She believes in creating content that she enjoys and sharing what matters to her, which has attracted a community of like-minded supporters. Her positive attitude and bubbly personality have helped her navigate the sometimes difficult world of social media with very few issues with internet trolls and mean comments.
