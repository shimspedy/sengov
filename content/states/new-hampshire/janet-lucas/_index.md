Janet Marie Lucas, a member of the Democratic Party, serves in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Grafton District 7. She assumed office on December 4, 2024, and her current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Janet Lucas has had a remarkable journey leading up to her role in public service. Born and raised in a manufacturing town in Ohio, she attended public schools before earning a scholarship to Western College, now part of Miami University of Ohio. She later graduated from the Ohio State University College of Medicine, where she specialized in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Over the course of her 37-year career, she practiced and taught Ob-Gyn, serving on numerous hospital committees and even holding the position of Department Chair.

After retiring, Janet moved to Campton, New Hampshire, in 2018, where she became deeply involved in her local community. She has served on the Campton Zoning Board of Adjustment, the Campton Conservation Commission, and the Pemigewasset River Local Advisory Committee. Her dedication to public service and her community has been a driving force in her life.

Janet lives in the White Mountain region of New Hampshire with her wife, Sherrill. Together, they have two daughters and three grandchildren. In her free time, she enjoys hiking, outdoor photography, gardening, and spending quality time with family and friends. Her commitment to social justice, equality, and the well-being of her constituents continues to guide her work in the New Hampshire House of Representatives.
