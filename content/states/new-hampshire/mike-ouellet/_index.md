Mike Ouellet is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Coos 3. He is a member of the Republican Party. Ouellet assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Ouellet ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Coos 3 and won in the general election held on November 8, 2022. He lives in Colebrook, New Hampshire, and has served on the Coos County Planning Board.

In addition to his political career, Ouellet has been community-oriented and active throughout his adult life. He is a lifelong resident of Colebrook. His professional career has been in selling heavy construction equipment.

Ouellet's tenure in the New Hampshire House of Representatives has been marked by his involvement in various committees and legislative activities. For instance, in 2023-2024, he was assigned to the Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee.

In a notable event, Ouellet voted in favor of the Death With Dignity Bill (HB 1283), which allows the terminally ill the right to determine when and how they die. However, after voting in favor of the bill, he filed for reconsideration after having a change of heart on his long drive home to Colebrook. The bill conflicted with his faith as he has been a practicing Catholic his whole life.

Ouellet's political journey has been marked by his commitment to his constituents and his dedication to serving his community. His work in the New Hampshire House of Representatives continues to impact the lives of the people in Coos 3 and the state of New Hampshire.
