Lou D'Allesandro

Born on July 30, 1938, in Boston, Massachusetts, Lou D'Allesandro is a prominent figure in the New Hampshire political landscape. He is a member of the Democratic Party and has been serving the people of District 20 for multiple terms.

Education and Early Life

D'Allesandro is a proud alumnus of the University of New Hampshire (UNH), where he graduated in 1961. During his time at UNH, he was a three-year letterman on the football team and served as the team's co-captain during his senior season in 1960-61. He was also a two-year member of the lacrosse team and played one year of baseball for the Wildcats. He was a member of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity and was inducted into the UNH Hall of Fame on September 25, 2010.

Career in Sports

In 1963, D'Allesandro became the first athletic director and men's basketball coach at Southern New Hampshire University (known then as New Hampshire College), where he was instrumental in helping the school achieve NCAA status. As head coach, the men's basketball team won three consecutive conference titles from 1964-65 to 1966-67. He was inducted into the SNHU Penmen Hall of Fame in 1970.

Political Career

D'Allesandro's political career began in 1972 when he served the first of two terms in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He also sat on the New Hampshire Executive Council for six years and ran unsuccessfully for governor twice. Since winning the election in 1998, he has been serving in the New Hampshire Senate. He has often been an advocate for policies benefiting working-class residents, and his endorsement has been sought by Democratic presidential candidates for decades.

Retirement

On May 21, 2024, D'Allesandro announced his retirement after more than 50 years of elected political service. In his emotional speech in Concord, he said, "In the long run, we made a difference. And the hardest thing is to walk away. but for everything there's a beginning and there's an end, and that's life. You know, that's life."
