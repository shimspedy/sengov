Henry Giasson is a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough District 29. He assumed office on December 4, 2024, and his current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Born in Minot, North Dakota, Henry grew up in a military family, which instilled in him a strong sense of discipline and service. At the age of 17, he joined the U.S. Army, where he served honorably for 24 years. His military career included multiple overseas deployments, disaster response missions, and domestic emergency actions. After retiring from the Army, he was recognized as a disabled veteran by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Henry's dedication to public service extends beyond his military career. He is an active participant in his local community and has been involved in various initiatives, although he was precluded from holding elected office until 2020 due to his active-duty status. His passion for transportation and infrastructure led him to serve on the House Transportation Committee, where he contributes to discussions on air, land, and water transportation policies.

Outside of his professional life, Henry is an avid motorcyclist and a certified New Hampshire state rider coach. He has a deep love for travel and has visited 47 states, often exploring historical sites, museums, and natural wonders. His hobbies include camping, target shooting, fencing, and musicâ€”he is currently learning to play the drums. Henry is also a lifetime member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and AMVETS, and he actively supports charitable causes within the motorcycle community.

Henry's commitment to his constituents and his diverse life experiences make him a dedicated and relatable representative for Hillsborough District 29. His journey from a military career to public office reflects his unwavering dedication to serving others and making a positive impact on his community.
