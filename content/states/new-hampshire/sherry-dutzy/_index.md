Sherry Dutzy is an American politician and a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, where she represents Hillsborough County District 6. She is a Democrat.

Sherry Dutzy was born and raised on the outskirts of Detroit during the civil rights era. Coming from an extended family of small business owners, her parents owned a dry-cleaning business where she began working at the age of 10. After graduating from East Detroit High School, Sherry attended Michigan State University where she met her husband, Jack. They moved to California for his first job where she graduated summa cum laude from California State University Long Beach in 1970 with a degree in Sociology and Social Welfare.

Upon graduation, they moved to Nashua, New Hampshire where they have lived ever since. Sherry's first career was as a social worker. Upon receiving her MSW from Boston University she worked as a medical and psychiatric social worker where she often saw the ineffectiveness of public policy. This still exists today whereby the system often rewards those who know how to play it and punishes those who wish to get ahead. She saw benefits being terminated because a client made a few dollars over the maximum while, at the same time, the job they had didn't cover essential needs.

In part due to low wages that couldn't support self-sufficiency, Sherry left social work in 1980 to pursue an MBA at Northeastern University and worked in technical sales and business development until semi-retirement. Given the opportunity to travel extensively across the US and world, she was able to interact with many cultures and see how the human need for security, organization and stability links us together. This fit very well with her love for sociology and anthropology.

After full-time employment where her travel schedule made volunteering difficult, Sherry wanted to give back to her community. Building on her lifetime of gardening and care of the environment, she sought and was appointed to the Nashua Conservation Commission where she now serves as chair. In 2018 she ran for her first term in the State House after seeing how years of a pro-business stance had decimated school budgets and mental health services.

During her first term she served on the Environment & Agriculture Committee which works to assist farmers, protect the environment, provide for animal welfare and seeks to maintain the NH way of life that we all value. Dutzy was elected in 2018 as part of the Democratic blue wave that swept the United States, including New Hampshire. In 2019, Dutzy voted in favor of HB 564, a gun control law that bans firearms being carried on public school property in New Hampshire. She endorsed Michael Bennet during the 2020 democratic primaries.
