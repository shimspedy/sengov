She has been serving on the Stratham Select Board since 2018 and became the Vice Chair in the spring of 2022. Notably, she is only the second woman to have served on the Stratham Board.

In addition to her role on the Select Board, Allison is the Executive Director of the nonprofit Great Bay Stewards. This organization is the friends group to the Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. As the Executive Director, she oversees the organizational budget, serves as staff to the nonprofit board of trustees, plans events and fundraisers, writes and maintains grants, and manages communications.

Allison and her husband Brian moved from Chicago to New Hampshire in 2007. They live in Stratham with their two daughters, Clara (16) and Evelyn (13), and their dog Wally. Brian is a radiation oncologist who works at the Elliot Hospital in Manchester, while their daughters attend Cooperative Middle School and Exeter High School.

Originally from Virginia, Allison graduated from the University of Virginia with a degree in biology and completed graduate studies at the University of California Berkeley in its Integrative Biology department.

Allison has a rich history of local volunteer experience. She has served on the National Estuarine Research Reserve Association as a Friends & Foundation Representative, the Stratham Conservation Commission as a chair and secretary, and the Stormwater Source Water Protection Plan Committee. She has also been a part of the Stratham Recreation Commission, Seacoast Conservation Commission Roundtable, Regional Steering Committee for the Age Friendly Communities Initiative, Forestry Management Plan Ad-hoc Committee, Smyk House Ad-hoc Committee, and Pedestrian-Cycling Advocacy Committee. At the Stratham Memorial School, she has served as an annual book sale co-chair, fifth grade committee member, and class parent.

Allison Knab is a passionate and proven community leader, committed to making Stratham an even better place to live, work, and raise a family. She is running to ensure that decisions made in Concord represent the needs and concerns of its residents not just the inclinations of politicians.
