Donovan Fenton is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Democratic Party, currently serving his term in the New Hampshire State Senate, representing District 10. He assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Born and raised in Keene, New Hampshire, Donovan was fortunate to experience the political process in a very personal way, working on campaigns at a young age. His early exposure to politics sparked a lifelong commitment to public service.

Before his tenure in the State Senate, Donovan served three terms in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. During his time in the House, he served on the Environment and Agriculture and Transportation Committees and was also a member of the NH Canadian Trade Council.

Donovan is not just a politician; he is also a community leader. He has served on the boards of The Community Kitchen of Keene and the Cedarcrest Center for Children with Disabilities. He was a volunteer for Monadnock Center for Violence Prevention and an overnight volunteer for Hundred Nights Emergency Shelter.

In addition to his political and community service, Donovan runs a small family business. He started mowing lawns when he was in high school and has worked his way up through each position in the company.

Donovan is a graduate of Towson University, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Social Sciences. He also holds a Master's degree from George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management. He is a graduate of the National Automobile Dealers Association Academy.

Donovan lives in Keene with his wife Jacqueline and their two sons, Harrison and Cooper. He is a strong advocate for working families and is dedicated to putting the people of New Hampshire first.
