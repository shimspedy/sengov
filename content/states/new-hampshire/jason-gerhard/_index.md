Jason Gerhard is an American politician who serves as a Republican member for the Merrimack 25th district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He was born in Long Island, New York.

In his early life, Gerhard was involved in some controversial activities. On June 8, 2009, he purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition and the next day, he bought necessary ingredients for manufacturing pipe bombs. The pipe bombs consisted of cylinders of pipe filled with explosive powder, with space for a fuse to be inserted; twenty-one pipe bombs were found. On July 30, 2010, Gerhard was sentenced to 240 months' imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and a $400 special assessment.

In September 2022, Gerhard defeated Kenna Cross in the Republican primary election for the Merrimack 25th district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, comprising the city of Franklin and the town of Northfield. In November 2022, he defeated Deborah Wheeler in the general election, winning 55 percent of the votes. He assumed office in December 2022.

Gerhard has been known for his unique political stances. He sponsored a bill to trigger the secession of New Hampshire from the union, and another to allow people to sell their own organs for a profit. He also pushed to restore gun rights for ex-felons and sponsored a bill to explicitly permit recording in all public places in New Hampshire, including the federal courthouse. However, all of these bills failed to find traction in the State House.

Despite his controversial past and unique political stances, Gerhard has remained a steadfast advocate for his beliefs. He continues to serve in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing the Merrimack 25th district.
