This academic foundation laid the groundwork for her commitment to community service and advocacy.

After completing her education, Karen worked with the Head Start program, focusing on early childhood education and support for families in need. Her dedication to making a difference eventually led her to a career in the title insurance industry, where she gained over two decades of experience.

She serves as a selectman for Ward 2 in Hillsborough, demonstrating her dedication to grassroots leadership and community engagement. Her ability to connect with people and understand their concerns has made her a respected figure in her district.

Karen resides in Manchester, New Hampshire, with her family. She is married and has three children, who inspire her to work towards a better future for all families in the state.
