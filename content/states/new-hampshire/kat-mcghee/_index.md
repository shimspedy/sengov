Kat McGhee is a dedicated public servant and a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. She has a rich personal and professional history that has shaped her into the leader she is today.

Born to a father who served in the navy for 20 years and a mother who worked as a supervisor in an aircraft factory during WWII, Kat was instilled with a strong work ethic from an early age. She has two older brothers and has always had a love for learning, which she attributes to the public school system.

Kat is a self-starter who worked multiple jobs during high school to fund her own education. She attended Birkbeck College in England and later attended classes at a community college and UMass Boston. She eventually earned a Masters degree from Cambridge College.

Kat married young, and although her first marriage did not work out, she considers her daughter Megan to be the greatest gift of her life. She learned the invaluable lesson of independence as a successful single mom and believes that it's not being knocked down that defines you, but how you pick yourself up.

Kat later married John, a retired air-force officer with a PhD in nuclear engineering. Together, they have four grown children, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. John was working to get a small start-up off the ground when they met in 2000, and he has since made a success of his business.

In her professional career, Kat began managing enterprise-wide projects at John Hancock Financial Services during her 20+ year career as a technology training professional in the Technical Education Center (TEC). She moved to Hollis in 2005 for the schools while their youngest was still at home.

As a New Hampshire State Representative, Kat is a 'once in a generation legislator' who relentlessly works to understand and tackle key issues at a depth rarely seen by those in the energy industry. She is a unifying force in local energy policy and her humility, technical expertise, and infectious optimism are set to benefit New Hampshire residents for years to come.
