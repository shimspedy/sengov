Bob Healey is a member of the Republican Party and currently serves as a representative in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough 12. He assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Before his political career in New Hampshire, Bob Healey was a candidate for the U.S. House to represent New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District. He ran for election in 2022 but unfortunately lost in the general election held on November 8, 2022.

In addition to his political pursuits, Bob Healey is a businessman. He runs the Ocean County-based Viking Yacht Company, a family-owned shipbuilding business that employs almost 1,600 mostly-blue collar employees and manufactures high-quality semi-custom fiberglass yachts.

Healey is also known for his philanthropic efforts. He runs the Healey International Relief Organization, which has spent millions delivering healthcare services, food, clean water, and education programs in the war-torn African nation of Sierra Leone.

Interestingly, before his business and political careers, Healey was the lead singer in a punk rock band, The Ghouls, that was well-known in the Philadelphia area and toured nationally. Some of the lyrics were hardcore and sometimes violent. Healey acknowledges his past as a punk rocker and believes that his music career, which ended almost fifteen years ago, helped shape who he is today.

Healey's journey from punk rocker to businessman to politician is a testament to his diverse experiences and adaptability. Today, he is a dedicated public servant committed to representing the people of Hillsborough 12 in the New Hampshire House of Representatives.
