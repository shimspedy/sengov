Amanda Elizabeth Toll is an American politician currently serving as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives from the Cheshire 16 district. She assumed office on December 2, 2020.

Born and raised in New Hampshire, Toll pursued her higher education at Hampshire College where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science, women's studies, and modern American history. She furthered her education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she obtained a Master of Education.

Outside of her political career, Toll has made significant contributions as a social studies teacher and a small business owner. Her dedication to education extends beyond the classroom as she co-sponsored a bill in January 2022 that would require consent education to be a part of the curriculum in New Hampshire public schools.

In addition to her legislative duties, Toll is a member of the House State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee. Her commitment to public service and her constituents is evident in her work and contributions to the state of New Hampshire.

Toll ran for re-election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Cheshire 15 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. Her current term ends on December 4, 2024.
