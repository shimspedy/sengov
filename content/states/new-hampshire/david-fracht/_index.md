David Fracht is an American politician who serves as a Democratic member for the Grafton 16th district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He assumed office on September 6, 2023, succeeding Joshua Adjutant.

Fracht attended Western Reserve University. His career experience includes owning a business. In 2023, he ran in a special election for the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Grafton 16. He won in the special general election on August 22, 2023, defeating John P. Keane.

The special general election was a significant event. Fracht won with a decisive 71 percent of the votes. This victory was seen as a blowout win for the Democrats in the Grafton County District 16 special election. The New Hampshire Democratic Party welcomed Fracht to the State House and celebrated his overwhelming win in the Enfield special election.

Fracht is seen as an extraordinary Granite Stater and a dedicated public servant who will stop at nothing to help protect the rights and liberties of all Granite Staters. His victory in the special election was the third special election victory in a row for Democrats and the seventh victory of eight special elections since 2021.

The momentum of House Democrats cannot be overstated. With this seat, Democrats have decisively won their seventh victory in eight special elections since 2021 and come within a hair's breadth of taking the majority. The current elected House makeup is 199 Republicans to 197 Democrats, 2 Independents with two vacancies.

Fracht's victory was celebrated by the Democratic Victory Campaign Committee and its staff, who were instrumental in this win. The people of Enfield showed up in huge numbers for their community, casting a total of 690 votes. The unofficial results of the Enfield special election showed 495 votes for Democrat David Fracht and 194 votes for Republican John Keane.
