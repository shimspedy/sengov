During his tenure, he joined the International Association of Firefighters and has been a card-carrying dues-paying member for 50 years.

In addition to his service in the fire department, MacKenzie has been a prominent figure in the labor movement.

He has been recognized nationally for his numerous legislative and political achievements which include increasing the minimum wage, improving public sector pension benefits, implementing post-retirement medical benefits, expanding card check neutrality for public employees, guaranteeing COLA adjustments for public employees, securing best value contracting legislation, expanding safety standards training to public employees and reforming the workers compensation system, and achieving equal pay legislation. He has been a leader in many legislative battles, including defeating anti-worker "right to work" legislation 18 times.

In 2018, MacKenzie ran for the United States House of Representatives in New Hampshire's 1st congressional district. Although he did not win, his campaign demonstrated his commitment to the people of New Hampshire and his dedication to progressive values.

In 2022, MacKenzie was reelected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives and received the highest number of votes in the state. He served in the House from 2016-2018 and served on the Labor Committee.
