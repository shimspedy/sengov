Erica Layon is an American politician who serves as a Republican member for the Rockingham 13th district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. She has been in office since December 3, 2020.

Born and raised in Derry, New Hampshire, Erica pursued her higher education at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics in 2001.

After graduation, Erica embarked on a diverse career path. She worked as an economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an options market maker on Wall Street, and a medical device analyst. These experiences have provided her with a unique perspective on economic and healthcare issues.

In the 2020 election, Erica was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Rockingham's 13th district as a Republican member. Since 2021, she has served as the vice chair of the Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs Committee. Her work in this role has been instrumental in shaping health and social policies in the state.

However, Erica's political career has not been without controversy. In May of 2022, she was arrested for driving while intoxicated. A video of the arrest surfaced in which she implies that a town councilor paid police to arrest her. Despite this setback, Erica continues to serve her constituents and work on their behalf.

Erica Layon's term in office is set to end on December 4, 2024. As a dedicated public servant, she continues to advocate for her constituents and work towards improving the lives of the people in her district.
