Kelley Potenza is an American politician who serves as a Republican member for the Strafford 19th district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. She was born and raised in New Hampshire, a state she is proud to call home. She strongly believes in the motto of her home state, "Live FREE or Die", and is committed to voting in a way that protects the rights of the people in Rochester and all Granite Staters.

Potenza is deeply invested in keeping the public educated and informed about what is occurring in Concord. She has spent three years studying the New Hampshire Constitution and has immersed herself in the legislative process to better serve her constituents.

Before her tenure in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Potenza served as a member of the Strafford County delegation and was the vice chair of the Strafford County GOP. She is also a member of the Environment and Agriculture Committee in the House. This committee is responsible for considering all matters concerning agricultural and farm problems of the state, physical land use including current use, the various agricultural organizations, the protection of the state's environment from forms of pollution other than air or water pollution, waste management issues, and such other matters as may be referred to it.

In addition to her political roles, Potenza is actively involved in many New Hampshire organizations. These include the 603 Alliance, Convention of States, Cornerstone Action, Government Integrity Project, Health Freedom NH, Make Americans Free Again, New Hampshire Firearms Coalition (NHFC), New Hampshire Liberty Alliance (NHLA), New Hampshire Right to Life (NHRTL), RebuildNH, and Young Americans for Liberty (YAL).

Potenza ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Strafford 19 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024.
