Gary Gilmore is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He represents Strafford District 16, having assumed office on December 4, 2024. His current term is set to conclude on December 2, 2026.

A lifelong resident of New Hampshire, Gary Gilmore has been deeply involved in his community for decades. After graduating from the University of New Hampshire with a degree in psychology, he moved to Dover in 1978, where he has lived ever since. Over the years, Gary has been a passionate advocate for environmental conservation, dedicating himself to preserving New Hampshire's natural beauty. An avid outdoorsman, he has hiked over 1,000 miles of the Appalachian Trail, showcasing his commitment to the environment both personally and professionally.

Gary's contributions to his community extend beyond environmental advocacy. In 1989, he spearheaded the creation of Dover's recycling program, a pioneering effort that laid the groundwork for sustainable waste management in the area. He has also served on the city's solid waste advisory committee since its inception in 1991. During his tenure on the Dover City Council, Gary played a pivotal role in preserving the McConnell Center and ensuring the surrounding green spaces were maintained for public use.

In addition to his environmental and civic efforts, Gary has been a steadfast supporter of voting rights. For nearly three decades, he has worked as an election officer in Ward 3, striving to ensure free and fair elections for all eligible voters. His dedication to public service is further exemplified by his legislative achievements during his previous tenure in the statehouse in the 1990s. As a Democrat in a Republican-controlled legislature, Gary successfully authored and passed approximately 130 pieces of legislation, demonstrating his ability to build consensus and achieve meaningful results.

Professionally, Gary owned and operated an independent carpentry business for 35 years before transitioning to a role as a researcher for the New Hampshire state archives. In this capacity, he visited every town hall in the state twice in a single year, gaining a unique perspective on the diverse needs of New Hampshire's communities. He retired from this position in 2023, bringing his wealth of experience and knowledge to his current role in the state legislature.

Gary Gilmore's priorities as a state representative include protecting reproductive rights, ensuring access to free and fair elections, and advocating for environmental preservation. His extensive background in public service, combined with his deep connection to the community, positions him as a dedicated and effective advocate for the people of Strafford District 16.
