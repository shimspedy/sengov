Darrell Louis has been a lifelong resident of Littleton, New Hampshire, where he has built a strong connection with his community. He graduated from Plymouth State College (now Plymouth State University) with a Bachelor of Arts in History. Early in his career, he worked as a district representative for former U.S. Congressman Charlie Bass, representing New Hampshire's 2nd District. Following this role, he transitioned into the financial sector, working as a loan officer for People's Bank of Littleton. When his position was eliminated due to a merger in 2000, Darrell took a leap of faith and started his own insurance and financial services business, which he continues to operate successfully.

In addition to his professional achievements, Darrell has been deeply involved in local government and community activities. He served on the Littleton Budget Committee for three years and has been a board member for the Littleton Area Chamber of Commerce, as well as various youth sports non-profit organizations. A passionate advocate for youth development, he has coached football and baseball, finding joy in mentoring young athletes. Outside of his professional and community commitments, Darrell enjoys outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, skiing, and hiking.

Darrell Louis's dedication to his constituents and his community is evident in his work on the Public Works and Highways Committee in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. His focus includes the development and maintenance of public highways, state bonding authority, and capital expenditures related to infrastructure and coastline preservation. As a small business owner and active community member, Darrell brings a unique perspective to his legislative role, advocating for policies that support small businesses and strengthen local economies.
