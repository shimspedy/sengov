Jason M. Osborne was born on June 15, 1977. He is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Rockingham 4, which comprises the towns of Auburn, Chester, and Sandown. In November 2020, the Republican caucus chose him to serve as the New Hampshire House Majority Leader.

Osborne is originally from Defiance, Ohio, where his family founded Credit Adjustments, Inc. (CAI), a debt collections company, in 1964. Osborne joined the family firm in 1995 and worked as the CIO, and later CEO. With Osborne as CEO, CAI applied for and was granted more than $4 million in federal loans from the Paycheck Protection Program. In 2021, CAI re-branded as Mammoth Tech. In 2022, Mammoth Tech. abruptly closed, laying off more than 500 employees. The company is currently facing a class-action lawsuit for failing to give notice.

In 2010, Osborne moved to New Hampshire from Ohio as part of the Free State Project. As New Hampshire House Majority Leader, Osborne has been credited with achieving conservative legislative victories despite the Republican caucus's slim majority. He has been instrumental in pushing forward conservative policies in areas such as taxes, gun rights, school choice, religious liberty, abortion, and election law.

Osborne holds a PhD in economics from George Mason University. He is known for his consensus-driven approach to leading Republicans. He believes in figuring out what people want to do and then showing them how to get there. Despite his active political career, Osborne prefers to keep a low media profile. His Twitter account is private, an unusual move for a public official, and he mostly avoids dealing with reporters.
