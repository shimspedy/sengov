Shannon E. Chandley, born on September 14, 1962, is an American politician hailing from the state of New Hampshire. She is a member of the Democratic Party and has had a significant political career in the state.

Chandley's political journey began in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, where she served three noncontiguous terms between 2008 and 2010, 2012'2014, and 2016'2018. Her dedication to public service was evident during her tenure in the House, where she worked diligently to represent her constituents.

In 2018, Chandley decided to run for the New Hampshire Senate from the 11th district. She won the election and assumed office on December 5, 2018.

Her work in these committees showcased her commitment to improving the lives of the people in her district.

However, in 2020, Chandley was defeated by the seat's former Republican incumbent, Gary Daniels. Despite this setback, Chandley did not give up. She ran again in 2022, defeated Daniels, and returned to the Senate. Her resilience and determination are a testament to her dedication to public service.

Outside of her political career, Chandley has been involved in various local boards. She has served as the director of the board of the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, on the board of directors of the Girl Scouts of the Green and White Mountains, and as the chair of the SHARE Outreach, Inc. Board of Directors. These roles highlight her commitment to community service and social justice.
