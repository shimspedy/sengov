Allison Nutting-Wong is a distinguished member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. Born around 1991, she has dedicated her life to public service and making a difference in her community.

She began her political journey by earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Russell Sage College. This solid foundation in political science equipped her with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complex world of politics.

Before embarking on her political career, Nutting-Wong worked for 10 years as an office manager. This experience in the corporate world provided her with valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by businesses, which she has been able to apply in her role as a representative.

In 2014, Nutting-Wong made her first foray into politics when she ran unsuccessfully for one of the New Hampshire House of Representatives seats representing the Hillsborough 34 district. Despite this initial setback, she remained undeterred and continued to pursue her political ambitions.

In 2015, she ran unsuccessfully for the position of at-large representative of the Nashua School District. However, her perseverance paid off when, on November 8, 2016, she was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives where she represented the Hillsborough 34 district.

Her tenure in the Hillsborough 34 district came to an end on May 24, 2018, when she resigned after moving out of the district. But this was not the end of her political journey. On November 6, 2018, Nutting-Wong was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives where she now represents the Hillsborough 32 district.

As a Democrat, Nutting-Wong has been a strong advocate for education, healthcare, and basic human rights. She is committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community for all residents of New Hampshire.

Outside of her political career, Nutting-Wong leads a fulfilling personal life. She resides in Nashua, New Hampshire, and is married to Matthew. Together, they have one son. In 2022, she bravely shared her experience with a recent miscarriage in an op-ed published by the New Hampshire Union Leader, further demonstrating her courage and resilience.

Today, Nutting-Wong continues to serve her community with dedication and passion. As a mother, a politician, and a community leader, she is a role model for many and a testament to the power of perseverance and commitment to public service.
