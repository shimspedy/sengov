Linda Franz is a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Grafton District 6. She assumed office on December 4, 2024, and her current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Originally from Massachusetts, Linda Franz and her husband, Ron, retired in 2014 and moved to New Hampshire, drawn by the state’s charm and the motto “Live Free or Die.” Before retirement, Linda had a long career in accounting and finance, working in diverse business environments for nearly four decades. Post-retirement, she discovered a passion for local government and served as the Administrative Assistant to the Select Board in Wentworth for three years. This role allowed her to gain valuable experience in town management and fostered her commitment to serving her community.

Linda is deeply involved in her local community, holding positions such as Secretary for the Planning Board, Deputy Town Treasurer, and Treasurer for the Trustees of the Trust Funds. She also participates in ballot tallies during elections and continues to assist with budgets, warrant articles, and town reports. Her dedication to her community extends to her involvement with the Wentworth Historical Society, where she helps organize popular events like Dinner on the Bridge and Christmas on the Common.

In her personal life, Linda enjoys spending time with her family, which includes two adult children, one grandchild, and a beloved dog. She and her husband have shared many adventures, from camping and boating to exploring nature. As a state representative, Linda is committed to upholding conservative values, advocating for Second Amendment rights, preserving New Hampshire’s natural beauty, and supporting educational freedom. Her dedication to her district and her state reflects her passion for public service and her belief in the importance of community involvement.
