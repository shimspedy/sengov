James Thibault is a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Merrimack County's 25th District. He assumed office on December 4, 2024, and his current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Born on December 27, 2005, in Laconia, New Hampshire, James Thibault is among the youngest state legislators in American history. He grew up in the Franklin-Tilton-Northfield community, where his family has deep roots. His mother, Doreen, hails from Franklin, while his father, Richard, is a native of Northfield. James has two sisters, Kristina and Ashley, and his upbringing in a close-knit community has greatly influenced his values and political aspirations.

Thibault graduated from Winnisquam Regional High School, where he demonstrated a strong interest in civic engagement and leadership. He participated in prestigious programs such as the American Legion's Boys Nation and the United States Senate Youth Program, which provided him with invaluable insights into government and public service. These experiences fueled his passion for civic education and advocacy, inspiring him to pursue a career in politics.

Before his election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Thibault served as the youth co-chair of the New Hampshire Legislative Youth Advisory Council and as the political director for the High School Republican National Federation. His dedication to public service and his commitment to representing the interests of his community earned him widespread support during his campaign.

In the 2024 elections, Thibault defeated his opponents in both the Republican primary and the general election, securing over 60% of the vote in the latter. As a legislator, he is focused on preserving New Hampshire's low taxes, promoting local control, and advocating for education freedom. He is also committed to addressing the challenges faced by families in his district and ensuring that every student has access to opportunities for civic engagement and government participation.

Currently a freshman at Saint Anselm College, Thibault continues to balance his academic pursuits with his responsibilities as a state representative. His dedication to public service, combined with his youthful energy and fresh perspective, has made him a standout figure in New Hampshire politics. Thibault's journey serves as an inspiration to young leaders across the country, demonstrating that age is no barrier to making a meaningful impact in one's community.
