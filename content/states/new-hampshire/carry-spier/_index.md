Carry Spier is a dedicated and experienced member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough District 6. She was born in the Bronx, NY, as the oldest of five children. Her parents, first-generation Americans, instilled in her the importance of education, leading all their children to complete public school and proceed to college and graduate school.

Spier's professional journey spans over 53 years, primarily in the Military Aerospace industry. She has worked as a systems engineer and systems engineering manager on various projects from Apollo to F-35 across an extensive array of technologies in the US, Canada, Japan, and the UK.

About two decades ago, Spier developed a deep concern for the effects of global warming on animals. This led her to start filming endangered birds and large mammals across the planet, sometimes in collaboration with National Geographic. She has traveled to Tibet, Antarctica, Russia, China, Southeast Asia, the Amazon, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, northern Canada, Svalbard, Madagascar, Borneo, Australia, the Middle East, and other places with her cameras. Her firsthand experiences have made her acutely aware of the fragility of the planet and the impact of global warming, as represented by the loss of animal life, the loss of potable water, and the resulting effects that are happening around the world and now right in front of us.

In local government, Spier has been actively involved in campaigns for candidates in Nashua who support her ideas about clean energy, education, and the environment. She has made presentations and spoken at meetings of the Planning Board and the Board of Aldermen.

Spier is married to Danny Mills and they have been living in Nashua for the past 25 years. She worked at BAE Systems (formerly Sanders) for 23 years until her retirement.

As a legislator, Spier is a member of the Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee. Her role involves considering all matters pertaining to commerce, banks and banking institutions, insurance companies and contracts or insurance of any character, the licensing of businesses to sell liquor, the needs of the business community, all matters relating to consumer affairs and the economic conditions of commerce and industry, all matters relating to the economic development of the state, and such other matters as may be referred to it.

Spier ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Hillsborough 6 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. Her current term ends on December 4, 2024.
