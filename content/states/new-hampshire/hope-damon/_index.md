Hope Damon is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She serves as a representative for the Sullivan 8th district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Born and raised in Sullivan County, mostly Croydon, Hope Damon has been a resident since 1980. She began her career as a registered dietitian and diabetes educator, starting as the Food and Nutrition Services Director at New London Hospital. In 1987, she established The Nutrition Counseling Center, where she has been helping people achieve wellness.

Hope Damon is a past president and recognized young dietitian of the New Hampshire Dietetic Association. She attended public schools and graduated from Framingham State College. She is happily married to George Chait, a retired building contractor, and they are proud parents of two adult daughters who work for nonprofits.

In addition to her professional career, Hope Damon has been actively involved in community service. She was the founding president of Cinnamon Child Care Center in 1994, a parent cooperative formed after the abrupt closing of a for-profit childcare center serving over 50 families. The center continues to operate today.

She is a board member and grants committee co-chair of the New Hampshire Women's Foundation, which promotes opportunity and equality for women and girls statewide through research, education, advocacy, grant-making, and philanthropy. She is the granddaughter of a suffragette, Mabelle Merritt (1895-2000), and the daughter of a middle school social studies teacher - these are the roots of her respect for voting rights and desire to protect our democracy.

Hope Damon was one of the leaders in the nonpartisan, collaborative We Stand Up For Croydon Students campaign to restore their school budget after it was cut by 53%. Grassroots democracy prevailed with a 377-2 vote to fully restore school funding. We Stand Up For Croydon is now a nonpartisan community advocacy group promoting citizen participation and transparency in local government.

She believes that honesty, kindness, civility, and respect for a democratic process are essential to our government. Effective communication starts with recognizing what we agree on then builds towards common ground on issues. She believes the state of New Hampshire must be held responsible for fair funding of quality public education that is factual, based on a full accounting of our complex history and contemporary evolving scientific knowledge. We must know our history to learn from it!
