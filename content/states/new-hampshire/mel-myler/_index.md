Mel Myler is a distinguished member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Merrimack 9. He assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024. Prior to this, he served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Merrimack 10.

Mel Myler earned a B.A. from California Western University. His career experience includes working as a consultant with the KnowledgeWorks Foundation, the executive director of the NEA New Hampshire, and a field representative with the Michigan Education Association. He founded the Hopkinton Youth Soccer Association.

Throughout his career, Myler has been a proven leader, manager, and agent of change in education work for over forty-eight years. In 2008, he retired from his executive staff position with the National Education Association (NEA) after serving the organization at the local, state, and national level.

He is a consensus builder providing a hands-on, creative approach to strategic planning and systems thinking. In each of his work experiences, he has initiated organizational change to meet new demands faced by a changing world. His knowledge of organizational development and ability to organize has allowed him to seek the common ground to effect needed modifications in operation and program systems.

Through his career, he has demonstrated an ability to move an organization into new dimensions while accommodating the human side of the enterprise. He is recognized by his colleagues as a leader, mentor, and agent of change.

His professional accomplishments include past consultancy with the KnowledgeWorks Foundation (Cincinnati, OH) which initiated the 'Ohio Transformation Dialogue for Public Education' sponsored by Governor Strickland. He created a systems change strategy through the use of an organizational learning community training program and planning initiative for large systems change.

He sponsored a four-year organizational cultural change plan to create a 'Framework for Change' that initiated an inclusive decision-making process for governance and staff working in a union environment. He developed a strategic program for a collective bargaining and compensation program which moved in six years the average New Hampshire teacher salary from a rank of 50th to 23rd in the nation.

In the 2023-2024 legislative session, Myler was assigned to the House Education Committee. He has also served on the same committee in the 2021-2022 and 2019-2020 legislative sessions, and he was the Chair in the 2019-2020 session.
