Kevin A. Avard, born on January 25, 1963, is an American politician and a Republican member of the New Hampshire Senate. He represents District 12 and has been in office since 2020. Prior to this, he served in the same position between 2014 and 2018.

Born in Everett, Washington, Avard moved to New Hampshire where he has made significant contributions to the state's political landscape. He studied bible theology at Liberty University, which laid a strong foundation for his political career.

Avard's political journey began when he was elected to the New Hampshire Senate in 2014, defeating incumbent Democrat Peggy Gilmour. He also defeated Gilmour in a 2016 rematch to retain his seat. However, in 2018, Avard lost his seat to Democratic candidate Melanie Levesque. Despite this setback, he made a comeback in 2020 and has been serving the District 12 since then.

Before his tenure in the Senate, Avard was a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 2010 to 2012. He also served on the Franklin City Council from 2000 to 2002, demonstrating his commitment to public service at both the local and state levels.

Apart from his political career, Avard is a small business owner who is dedicated to protecting rights, holding the line on taxes and spending, and creating new jobs. He has worked tirelessly to lessen the weight on New Hampshire's small businesses, contrasting with politicians who want to grow government and increase burdensome rules and regulations.

Avard is also very active outside of politics in his community. He is heavily involved in fundraising to support music programs at Nashua Public Schools, helping underprivileged students afford musical instruments. This shows his commitment to education and the arts, and his belief in giving back to the community.

Kevin Avard resides in Nashua, New Hampshire with his wife Tracy and their five children. His dedication to his family, community, and the state of New Hampshire is evident in his work and service. As a senator, Avard continues to focus on getting the drug crisis under control, fixing roads and bridges, supporting veterans, funding mental health, passing legislation to assist the free-market in lowering healthcare costs, and ensuring students have first-class schools.
