Leah Cushman was born and raised in Reading, Massachusetts, where she lived with her grandparents. As a child, she enjoyed spending every weekend from April through November camping at her grandparent's seasonal campsite in southern New Hampshire. She spent her time fishing, catching frogs, swimming, and enjoying nature. She loved reading and had a particular interest in the subject of biology.

In 2014, Cushman earned an associate's degree from Middlesex Community College. She later earned a B.S. in nursing from the University of Massachusetts. Cushman is a registered nurse. In 2017, Cushman and her family moved from Massachusetts to Weare, New Hampshire.

In terms of her political positions, Cushman opposes COVID-19 vaccine mandates for religious reasons. In 2021, she sponsored a bill that would have allowed over-the-counter sale of ivermectin. In the same year, Cushman voted for HB 625 which prohibits abortion after 24 weeks.

Cushman's career experience includes working as a nurse. She has served on the Weare Board of Fire Wards. She is currently serving her 2nd term in the NH House and represents the town of Weare.
