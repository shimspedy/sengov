Peter Schmidt is a member of the Democratic Party and currently serves in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Strafford 14. He assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Schmidt ran for re-election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Strafford 14 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. This is his 10th term in the NH House, representing Dover Wards 1 and 2.

Born and raised in the United States, Schmidt graduated from Campion High School. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1956 to 1958. He then pursued higher education, earning a B.A. from Northern Illinois University in 1968 and an M.A. from Northwestern University in 1969.

Schmidt's career experience includes working as a university instructor. He is now retired from this position. His service in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1956 to 1958 is also a notable part of his biography.

In terms of committee assignments, Schmidt has been assigned to several committees throughout his tenure. For the 2023-2024 term, he was assigned to the House Executive Departments and Administration Committee. He has also served on the Administrative Rules Committee and the Executive Departments and Administration Committee in the 2021-2022 term.

Schmidt has shown a commitment to education and immigration issues. He introduced legislation that would allow non-citizens to qualify for in-state tuition if they met all of the other requirements associated with qualifying for in-state tuition. The bill would require that non-citizens have filed paperwork to apply for legal immigration status or will file paperwork as soon as she or he is eligible to do so. This legislation would apply to the University System of New Hampshire.
