Donald McFarlane is a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Grafton District 18. He assumed office on December 4, 2024, and his current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Donald McFarlane is a father, husband, and graduate Electrical Engineer, who has trained in the fields of information security, risk management, and incident/emergency management. He works as an information security expert with nearly three decades of experience as a leader. He spent a decade serving as a volunteer EMT and EMS chief, and currently serves on the planning board in the town of Orange.

A resident of Orange since 2008, Donald is running to be your state representative for Grafton County’s District 18 (comprising the towns of Alexandria, Bridgewater, Bristol, Canaan, Dorchester, Enfield, Grafton, Groton, Hebron and Orange) because he wants to make sure that New Hampshire remains a place where families can live, learn, and thrive for generations to come.

Donald grew up splitting his time between the UK and USA, and became a permanent resident in 1995 after completing his studies and military service. He achieved his dream in 2002 of becoming a US citizen and has been giving back to his community ever since.

Donald and his wife Karen have been married since 2012 and have a rambunctious four year old son named Cameron and a Sheltie named Neep. You may have seen Karen around town in one of her roles as Orange’s town welfare officer or volunteering at the Friends of Mascoma food pantry in Canaan.
