Debra O'Connell Altschiller was born on June 1, 1968. She is an American politician serving as a member of the New Hampshire Senate. Before this, she served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives for the Rockingham 19 district from 2016 to 2022.

Education:
Altschiller earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communication and media studies from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Career:
From 2007 to 2013, Altschiller worked as a freelance blogger and content writer. From 2012 to 2015, she was the community relations coordinator for Sexual Assault Support Services. Since 2015, she has been the community relations event coordinator for HAVEN NH, a non-profit organization that provides services to victims of domestic violence.

Altschiller was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2016. She was the Democratic nominee for the 24th district of the New Hampshire Senate in the 2022 election.

In her three terms in the House, Altschiller served on the Transportation, Judiciary and Children and Family Law committees. She is a member of the Children's Caucus, Women's Caucus, Gun Violence Prevention Caucus and Economic Justice Caucus.

Altschiller is a champion for the safety of all New Hampshire residents. She has dedicated her professional and public service career to keeping New Hampshire communities safe as a community liaison at a local violence prevention support center and the lead sponsor of key gun safety reforms.

She has never voted for an income, sales or capital gains tax, a fact that has been recognized multiple times by the bi-partisan Job Creators Alliance, which has contributed to her campaigns in recognition of her consistent votes against new taxes.

In 2019, Altschiller was the prime sponsor of New Hampshire's Red Flag Law, which empowers family members and law enforcement to quickly access the courts for expedited judicial review to temporarily remove firearms from a person who poses a danger to themselves or the public. This life-saving legislation passed both the House and Senate but was vetoed by the governor.

Altschiller holds a bachelor's from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, is a Leadership Seacoast alum, and a volunteer with End 68 Hours of Hunger and the Seacoast chapter of Moms Demand Action. She spent over a decade in service with the Stratham Fair, Exeter Area General Federation of Women's Clubs and Stratham Memorial School.
