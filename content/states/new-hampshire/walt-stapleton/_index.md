Stapleton's journey began in Fairfield, Connecticut, where he grew up before moving to Milford, Connecticut. He attended Notre Dame High School in West Haven, Connecticut. In 1964, he enlisted in the United States Army Transportation Corps with the 729th Railroad Battalion, marking the start of his service to the country.

In 1968, Stapleton married Claire Lois Fontaine. They raised three sons, Ralph, Patrick, and Gregory, in Barryville, New York. During this time, Stapleton worked on the New Haven Railroad and then the Erie Lackawanna Railroad as a Station Agent and then as a Railroad Police officer.

In 1983, Stapleton moved to Claremont, New Hampshire, where he currently resides. He served as the General Manager of Claremont and Concord Railroad. In 1986, he started a railroad consulting business and also became a licensed commercial insurance broker in 2001. He retired in 2017.

Stapleton's political career began in earnest in 2016 when he ran for a seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives representing the Sullivan 10 district.

Stapleton is known for his conservative views. He is anti-abortion and opposes same-sex marriage. He has been instrumental in updating the state Republican platform to protect the personhood of preborn life in the womb and uphold traditional man-woman marriage.
