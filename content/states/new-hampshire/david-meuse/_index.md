David Meuse is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Rockingham 37. He assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024. He ran for re-election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Rockingham 37 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

David Meuse lives in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He earned a B.A. in journalism from Pennsylvania State University in 1978. His career experience includes working as a partner with Aon Hewitt, a video producer with Sanders Associates, and a reporter with WMUR-TV.

He has served on the board of the NH Safe Water Alliance and has been affiliated with the NH Society of Photographic Artists and the NH Art Association.

In terms of his legislative service, he has been assigned to the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee for the years 2023-2024, 2021-2022, and 2019-2020.

As a state representative, he is looking forward to continuing to serve the people of Portsmouth in District 37 and 'new for 2023' people in the towns of New Castle and Newington too. He ran for re-election in 2022 because he believes that what's been happening in Concord doesn't reflect the values of New Hampshire or our communities. 

He is committed to addressing challenges related to energy prices, property taxes, housing, childcare, and public education. He believes that these are priorities for the seacoast and should be New Hampshire's priorities.
