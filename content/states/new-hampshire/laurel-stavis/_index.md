Laurel Stavis is an American politician who serves as a Democratic member for the Grafton 13th district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. She is currently in her second term as a member of the New Hampshire House, where she represents the City of Lebanon. She serves on the Municipal & County Government Committee.

In 2019, she chaired a Subcommittee related to short term rentals and was appointed a member of a Study Commission on zoning for tiny houses. She also helped craft HB559, banning single use plastics in New Hampshire. Representative Stavis believes that New Hampshire deserves efficient and effective government, and has spoken in support of policies and legislation that preserve the State's competitive advantage, its natural beauty, and the wellbeing of its residents.

She has been a member of the Lebanon Planning Board since 2016 and serves on the Upper Valley Lake Sunapee Regional Planning Commission. A longtime resident of historic West Lebanon, she continues to work with City and State officials towards remediating and revitalizing the Westboro Rail Yard. In November 2020, she was appointed as the Planning Board's designate on the Downtown West Lebanon Advisory Committee.

Representative Stavis is Chair of the LISTEN Community Services Board of Directors, one of the leading providers of social support in the Upper Valley, where she has overseen a doubling of the services provided to community members in need, and has worked with the Lebanon City Manager on a contract to provide regional mass feeding services during the coronavirus pandemic.

Formerly an Assistant Provost at Dartmouth College, she was honored with the Institute of International Education's Outstanding Service Award, helped to establish the first private liberal arts university in Kuwait, and led a multi-year USAID program on transforming higher education in Kosovo. A graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music, Ms. Stavis performs with several chamber music groups in the Upper Valley.
