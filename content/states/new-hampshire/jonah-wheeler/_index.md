Jonah Orion Wheeler, born on March 1, 2003, is an American politician and activist. He is currently serving as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough County District 33, which encompasses Peterborough and Sharon, for the Democratic Party. Wheeler assumed office on December 7, 2022.

Having been sworn in when he was 19 years old, he was among the youngest state legislators in the United States. Wheeler was born in Peterborough, New Hampshire. He graduated from ConVal Regional High School in 2021.

Before his political career, Wheeler had worked on the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign and interned for the progressive group Rights & Democracy. On June 20, 2020, Wheeler was a speaker at a George Floyd rally in Petersborough, New Hampshire. Wheeler was then appointed as an alternate on the Zoning Board of Adjustments in Peterborough, New Hampshire, a position he would hold until 2025.

On November 8, 2022, Wheeler was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representative, having received more votes than the two incumbent Democrat Representatives Peter Leishman and Ivy Vann, consequently unseating Vann, who had served in the House since 2014. He assumed office on December 7, 2022.

On December 20, 2023, Wheeler endorsed Marianne Williamson in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries. On January 6, 2024, Wheeler was selected as a New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district primary delegate for the Marianne Williamson 2024 presidential campaign.
