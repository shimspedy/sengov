Fred Davis Jr. is a dedicated public servant and a former member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He represented the Hillsborough 31 district and was in office from December 5, 2018, to December 4, 2020. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Before his political career, Davis served in the United States Marine Corps. After his military service, he worked as a truck driver until his retirement. His commitment to his community led him to serve as a moderator for the 4th Ward of Nashua.

On November 6, 2018, Davis was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He assumed office on December 5, 2018. However, his tenure was not to last, as he was defeated for re-election in the primary on September 8, 2020.

Despite the setback, Davis continues to be an active member of his community in Nashua, New Hampshire. He is known for his dedication to public service and his commitment to the people of New Hampshire.

In his personal life, Davis is a divorced father of one. His experiences in life and his dedication to serving his community have shaped him into a respected figure in New Hampshire politics.
