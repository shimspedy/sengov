James Roesener is an American politician serving as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives from the 22nd district. He was first elected in 2022, making history as the first openly transgender man to win election to any state legislature in the United States. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Roesener is openly transgender and bisexual. He lives in Concord, New Hampshire, and is married. His personal journey and identity have played a significant role in his political career, inspiring him to be a voice for the transgender community and to be a part of decision-making processes that affect this community.

In addition to his groundbreaking election, Roesener has been recognized for his commitment to various social issues. He has volunteered at a local clinic that provides abortion services, contraception, gender-affirming care, and other health care for the past eight years. His decision to run for office was partly motivated by the wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation introduced in states across the country, including in New Hampshire.

Roesener's political platform includes expanding nondiscrimination laws in health care, advocating for affordable housing, raising the state minimum wage to at least $15 per hour, and legalizing marijuana. He believes that his campaign was successful because he focused on unifying messages that resonate with all people, such as food security, housing, and work-life balance.

Despite his historic win and the responsibilities that come with his new role, Roesener remains humble and grounded. He shared that the reality of his achievement didn't fully sink in until he was in the statehouse, in his seat, participating in the legislative process. His story is not just about making history, but also about making a difference in the lives of the people he represents.
