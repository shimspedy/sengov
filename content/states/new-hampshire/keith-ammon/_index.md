Keith Ammon is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He is currently serving as a representative in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing the Hillsborough 42nd District. His tenure began in 2022 and his current term is set to end in 2024.

Born in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Keith Ammon moved to New Boston, New Hampshire in 2009. He is married to his wife and best friend, Susan. Professionally, he is a software developer specializing in pharmaceutical sales support data analytics. He is also a small business owner and a consultant.

Ammon's political career includes serving on the New Boston School Board from 2012 to 2015. He was first elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2014, representing the Hillsborough 40th District. He served in this position until 2018, when he was succeeded by Kat McGhee. However, he was re-elected in 2020 and continues to serve the people of New Hampshire.

In the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Ammon serves as the clerk for the Commerce and Consumer Affairs committee. He is also the Assistant Majority Whip. His political positions include voting against HB 1609 in 2022, which added an exception for a fatal fetal diagnosis to New Hampshire's 24 week ban on abortion services.

In 2021, Ammon spearheaded an effort to ban critical race theory in New Hampshire. His bill, which forbids schools from teaching 'race or sex scapegoating,' questioning the value of meritocracy and suggesting that New Hampshire or the USA is 'fundamentally racist,' was signed into law by Governor Chris Sununu in July 2021.

Ammon is also known for his involvement in the Free State Project, having moved to New Hampshire from Pennsylvania in 2009 as part of this initiative. In January 2016, he cosponsored a bill that would have allowed the state government to accept payment of taxes and fees in bitcoin, although it was defeated in committee.

In addition to his political career, Ammon runs Ammon Technology Services, a software company specializing in pharmaceutical sales. He is a member of the NH House Freedom Caucus and serves as director of the New Boston Republican Committee and the New Boston Taxpayers' Association. He has also contributed to the Bretton Woods Summit of Consumer's Research in 2017 and 2018 as a local subject matter expert on regulation in cryptocurrency.
