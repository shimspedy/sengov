Representative Deb Hobson is a dedicated public servant and a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. She was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives on November 6th, 2018 by the citizens of East Kingston, Newton, Kensington, and South Hampton. She was sworn in on December 5th, and thus began her journey in public service.

Deb Hobson is not just a representative, but also a wife and mother of two college-age kids. She grew up in Melrose, Massachusetts, and moved to East Kingston, New Hampshire in 2009. Her passions in state government on behalf of her constituents include promoting small businesses, academic excellence, supporting veterans and our military, improving the lives of seniors, and maintaining a clean environment.

She was very fortunate to be able to stay home and put her education and psychology classes to use with her family for 20 years. She became active in her community, at church, and with the town recycling commission. The events of September 11, 2001, sparked her interest in politics as she knew the world was going to be forever changed.

In 2014, she was elected to East Kingston Representative to the Exeter Region Cooperative School District as a write-in candidate. Her time on the school board has been a great introduction to how state government works, as state legislation greatly affects school districts. Committee work, budgets, and cooperation are integral parts of any well-run organization. Respect for difference of opinion and the ability to see things from the viewpoint of someone else is crucial for compromise.

Now, her goals surround local government and the increasing need for political unity. She hopes to be able to use her positive outlook to help bring sanity back to the state house and back to our community. Her experience being a mom will certainly help the arguing factions of our government.
