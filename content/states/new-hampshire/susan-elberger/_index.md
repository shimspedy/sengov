Susan Elberger is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough 5. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024. Elberger ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Hillsborough 5 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Susan Elberger lives in New Hampshire. She earned a B.A. in sociology and psychology and an M.A., Ed.S. in counseling and personnel services, both from the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany. Her career experience includes working as a mental health counselor and small business owner. Elberger volunteered as a member of the Lexington School Committee and the Lexington Town Meeting.

In addition to her professional and educational background, Elberger is a lifelong Democrat and a strong believer in democracy. She has only missed voting in one election since she reached voting age. As the granddaughter of immigrants who fled oppression in Europe, she wants to continue their dreams of America as the land of freedom and opportunity for all.

Elberger's priorities include protecting a woman's right to an abortion, adopting domestic renewable energy to lower energy costs, and fighting to keep public money in public schools so every student in New Hampshire has the opportunity to succeed.

In the 2022 general election for New Hampshire House of Representatives Hillsborough 5, Elberger was one of the three candidates who ran and won. The other two representatives for Hillsborough 5 are Shelley Devine and Heather Raymond.
