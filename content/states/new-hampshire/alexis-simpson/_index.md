Alexis Simpson is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Rockingham 33. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024. Simpson is affiliated with the Democratic Party.

She lives in Exeter, New Hampshire. Simpson earned a B.S. in physics from the University of Virginia, a master's degree in divinity from Emory University in 2000, and a master's degree in theology from Harvard University in 2020.

Her career experience includes working as the executive director of The Waysmeet Center, the bridge pastor of the First Congregational Church in Hancock, New Hampshire, and the interfaith coordinator with Phillips Exeter Academy.

Simpson is returning to the State Legislature having served previously in the 2015-2016 session. She recently completed a Master of Theology with a focus on ethics and politics at Harvard Divinity School and is a minister in the United Church of Christ.

With a background in physics and theology, Alexis is interested in policy and decision-making at the intersection of science, theology, and ethics. She has professional experience both as a local church pastor and as a chaplain in academic settings. She is personally and professionally committed to interfaith dialogue and community-building.

Alexis has a small garden and a passion for sustainable agriculture and local food systems. She lives in Exeter with her husband, an educator in religion, ethics, and human rights, and their teenage sons. She loves baseball and has periodically coached her son's youth baseball teams when she could be helpful.

Having focused a portion of her recent research on criminal justice reform with an emphasis on bipartisan approaches to combating racism in the criminal justice system, Alexis serves on Exeter's newly-created Police Stakeholders Committee.

In terms of her legislative duties, Simpson was assigned to the Resources, Recreation and Development Committee for the 2023-2024 term. In the 2021-2022 term, she was assigned to the House Judiciary Committee.

Simpson ran for re-election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Rockingham 33. She won in the general election on November 8, 2022.
