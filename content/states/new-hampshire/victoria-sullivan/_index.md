Victoria Sullivan is a Republican serving in the New Hampshire State Senate, representing District 18. She assumed office on December 4, 2024, and her current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Senator Sullivan has a rich history of public service and community involvement. Before joining the State Senate, she served as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough District 16 from 2014 to 2018. During her tenure in the House, she was an active member of the Education Committee and held the position of Assistant Majority Leader. Her legislative efforts included sponsoring bills to address the opioid crisis, advocating for play-based learning in early education, and championing one of the nation's strongest laws against female genital mutilation.

Outside of her legislative roles, Sullivan has been deeply involved in her community. She has served as the president of the Highland-Goffe’s Falls Elementary School PTA, directed the school’s drama club, and coached youth sports. Her commitment to public service extends to her work with organizations such as the Women’s Defense League of New Hampshire and the Oversight Commission for Children’s Services.

Professionally, Sullivan is the director of Freedom Staffing, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping individuals overcome barriers to employment, particularly those re-entering the workforce after recovery, homelessness, or incarceration. She is also the founder and chair of a sober home in Manchester, reflecting her dedication to supporting individuals in recovery.

A lifelong advocate for her community, Sullivan has also run for mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire, in both 2019 and 2021. Although she did not win, her campaigns highlighted her commitment to addressing local issues and improving the quality of life for Manchester residents.

Senator Sullivan is a graduate of Medway High School in Massachusetts and attended Northern Essex Community College. She resides in Manchester with her husband, Buddy, their two sons, and their rescue pets. In her free time, she enjoys hiking New Hampshire’s trails, camping, and engaging in sports shooting and archery. Her dedication to her family, community, and state continues to define her work as a public servant.
