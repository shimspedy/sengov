Jerry Stringham is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He serves as a representative for the Grafton 3rd district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He assumed office on December 7, 2022.

Before his political career, Jerry Stringham had a strong academic background. He earned a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an MBA from Harvard Business School. He also has experience as an entrepreneur in medical technology start-ups and founded a medical technology practice in 1998.

In his political career, Jerry Stringham has shown a strong work ethic and a bipartisan spirit. He has a 100% voter participation rating based on over 600 floor roll call votes. He served for two years on the Ways and Means Committee, making critical contributions to over 30 bills brought to the committee, including chairing a subcommittee effort on cross-border licensing of truck trailers.

Jerry Stringham has spoken on the floor of the house eleven times. His speeches have been written about in the NH Business Review, the Concord Times, and the Manchester Union Leader. The final vote went the way of his speeches in all 11 cases, several against considerable odds.

He has sponsored and authored two bills that were signed into law. One bill honored a fallen soldier and the second led to better protection of nursing home residents. He was the only representative or senator to primary sponsor more than one bill that was signed into law in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.

Jerry Stringham has also co-sponsored legislation that enables foster children to stay in the program past the age of 18, if they so choose, with federal government financial support. He worked on two of the three pieces of legislation that the Manchester Union Leader cited as the largest bipartisanship success in this term.

In addition to his legislative work, Jerry Stringham is active in his local community. He is involved in groups like the Lincoln Woodstock Rotary, Jean's Playhouse, and the Bridge Project. He also communicates regularly as a contributor in local papers under the rubric 'The Rep's Repartee' on many issues of importance.
