Nikki McCarter is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing the Belknap 8th district. She is a member of the Republican Party. McCarter assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024.

McCarter ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Belknap 8. She won in the general election on November 8, 2022. McCarter lives in Belmont, New Hampshire.

Before her political career, McCarter was involved in blue-collar, hands-on work. Whether it was renovating a space in her home or tackling a new retaining wall in her backyard, hard work has always been a part of McCarter's life. She moved to Belmont in 2009 and quickly fell in love with the beauty of the Lakes Region. Her conservative neighbors made her feel right at home.

McCarter is married and has two stepdaughters. She is concerned about the future for their girls and eventually their grandchildren, which is why she decided to run for office. She believes that future generations deserve the freedoms and liberties guaranteed to us, and she is committed to fighting to preserve them.

In her role as a state representative, McCarter has prioritized strengthening election integrity and security. She is committed to working with the legislature to eliminate no-excuse absentee ballots, eliminate same-day voter registration, remove electronic voting devices, and fight for 100% transparency in elections.

McCarter also aims to create easier access to substance abuse resources. Having lived a life surrounded by addiction, she has seen first-hand the terrible damage it does to a family and the community. McCarter is dedicated to transforming "Revolving Door" programs to create realistic avenues for people to get to the root of their problem.

McCarter stands on the side of liberty and personal responsibility, principles on which this country was founded. She believes that there are elected officials and bureaucrats that are working very hard to chip away at our freedoms and rights every day. McCarter is committed to rejecting these radical bills and calling them out.
