James Spillane is an American Republican politician who serves in the New Hampshire House of Representatives in Rockingham County alongside Jason Osborne and Kevin Verville. He has been serving in this position since December 3, 2014, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Spillane's political career has been marked by notable events. In 2020, he was investigated by the State Attorney General for a Facebook comment. In June 2023, he switched his endorsement to Ron DeSantis from Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries after Trump's criticism of Kayleigh McEnany.

However, his career has not been without controversy. In 2017, Spillane was arrested and charged with driving under the influence.

Beyond his political career, Spillane leads a fulfilling personal life. He lives in Deerfield and is a father of three children, all of whom are in the NH schools and UNH. He holds a BA in English from SNHU, and works as a Senior Technical writer and is a published author.

Spillane is a life-long hunter, a competitive archer, and a current Board Member for the Quality Deer Management Association (QDMA). He is committed to preserving and strengthening our 2nd Amendment Rights in New Hampshire, preserving the great American tradition of hunting, and ensuring that the game animals and their environment remain healthy so that every future generation can enjoy hunting New Hampshire.

With three children in the school systems in New Hampshire, Spillane has deep concerns about the quality of education, and objects strongly to programs such as Common Core and other federally intrusive mandates. He believes that decisions made locally are simply decisions that are better made! A quality education must include local control and parental choice.
