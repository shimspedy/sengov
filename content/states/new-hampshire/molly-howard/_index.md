Molly Howard is a member of the Democratic Party and currently serves in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough 31. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Molly Howard was born in Alaska and moved to New England in 1984. While pursuing careers as a cook and then in higher education and urban planning, she raised two sons in the Boston area. Her younger son was posted in Poland for five months with the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division. Frequent excursions to the White Mountains and countless weekends with close friends in Cornish, NH planted the seed for her move to New Hampshire, first to the Upper Valley to work at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth and then to Hancock.

To prepare for a role in the NH Legislature, she spoke with many voters in Hillsborough District 31 and closely studied New Hampshire's government and politics. She writes, gardens and wrangles chickens as caretaker at the home of friends. A lifelong Democrat, her interest in politics started with discussions at her family's dinner table. Molly believes that in a functioning government, the primary responsibility of elected officials is to ensure the well-being of their constituents through legislation and policy.

In the 2022 elections, Molly Howard ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Hillsborough 31. She won in the general election on November 8, 2022. In the Democratic primary for New Hampshire House of Representatives Hillsborough 31, Molly Howard advanced on September 13, 2022.

Molly Howard's career experience includes working as an administrative coordinator with the Dartmouth College Thayer School of Engineering, a senior associate with NBBJ, and an associate with Chan Krieger Sieniewicz. She is currently assigned to the Environment and Agriculture Committee in the New Hampshire House of Representatives.
