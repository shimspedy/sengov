Molly Howard is a Democratic member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Hillsborough District 31. She assumed office on December 18, 2024, and her current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Born in Alaska, Molly Howard's journey to public service has been shaped by a diverse career and a deep commitment to her community. She moved to New England in 1984, where she pursued careers as a cook, an administrative coordinator at Dartmouth College's Thayer School of Engineering, and an urban planning associate. Her professional experiences have given her a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing her constituents.

Molly's passion for politics was ignited during family discussions at the dinner table, and she has carried that enthusiasm into her role as a legislator. She believes that the primary responsibility of elected officials is to ensure the well-being of their constituents through thoughtful legislation and policy. As a member of the Environment and Agriculture Committee, she focuses on addressing agricultural issues, land use, and environmental protection in New Hampshire.

Outside of her legislative duties, Molly enjoys writing, gardening, and caring for chickens at her home in Hancock, New Hampshire. She is a proud mother of two sons, one of whom served with the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division. Her love for the White Mountains and her strong connections to the community have made her an advocate for preserving New Hampshire's natural beauty and fostering a sense of belonging for all residents.
