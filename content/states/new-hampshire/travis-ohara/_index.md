**Personal Biography**

Travis O'Hara was born in Laconia, New Hampshire, at Lakes Region General Hospital to Christine (Littlefield) Smith and Shannon O'Hara. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Fort McClellan, where his father was stationed. After a few years, they returned to Laconia, NH. Travis attended Pleasant Street School for grade school, then Memorial Middle School (now Laconia Middle School), and subsequently Laconia High School. He earned his bachelor's degree in Accounting and Finance from Granite State College while raising his daughter, whom he and his wife had at 16 years old.

Currently, Travis is a Business Development and Profitability Advisor. He resides in Belmont, NH, with his wife, Briana, their daughter, Gabriella (born in 2010), their son, Elijah (born in 2020), and their dog, Sawyer.

**Local Government Involvement**

Travis has not previously run for any local government office.

**Miscellaneous Information**

Travis is passionate about improving his community. He has witnessed Laconia, once a beautiful city, struggle with drug-related issues. Motivated by Steven Crowder's call to action, "Stop saying someone has to do something, and be that someone," Travis is determined to be that change for Laconia and Belmont.

He believes that small businesses are vital for the prosperity of a district and that excessive burdens on them harm the entire community. He advocates for intense competition among businesses to naturally raise wages and benefits, rather than relying on laws that could potentially damage burgeoning companies.

Travis is also a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and opposes legislation like the Red Flag Law, which he believes infringes on constitutional rights. He credits the state's governor for vetoing such bills and is committed to upholding the Bill of Rights and the Constitutions of both the United States and New Hampshire.

Having spent most of his life in Laconia, Travis is well-acquainted with its potential. Now living in Belmont, he aims to make both communities exemplary models for the rest of New Hampshire.
