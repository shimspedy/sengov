Cassandra Levesque, born around 1999, is an American politician serving in the state of New Hampshire. She has been a Democratic member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives since 2018, representing the Strafford 4 district. 

Levesque's journey into politics is quite unique. She became a Girl Scout when she was just five years old and started researching child marriage as a project for the program's Gold Award. This research led her to work with her state Representative, Jackie Cilley, to draft a bill that would eliminate provisions allowing minors to marry with judicial and parental consent. Despite the bill's initial failure, other legislation sponsored by Cilley passed which raised the minimum age for marriage from 13 to 16. Levesque vowed to continue advocating for the minimum marriage age to be raised to 18.

When both incumbents from the Strafford 4 district, Cilley and Len Turcotte, decided to retire, local Democrats convinced Levesque to run in the 2018 election. At just 19 years old, she became the youngest serving member of New Hampshire's legislature. Levesque was elected on a campaign of representing small businesses and addressing water-quality issues. She has continued to press the issue of child marriage in the legislature.

Levesque lives in Barrington, New Hampshire. She was first elected to public office in 2018 at 19 years old. Her current term ends on December 4, 2024. She has been assigned to the Children and Family Law Committee for the years 2019-2020, 2021-2022, and 2023-2024.
