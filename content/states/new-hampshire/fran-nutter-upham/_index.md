Fran Nutter-Upham is a dedicated and accomplished member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing the Hillsborough 33 district. She assumed office on December 5, 2018, following her election on November 6, 2018. As a member of the Democratic Party, she has made significant contributions to her community and state.

Born and raised in New Hampshire, Fran moved to Merrimack with her parents as a teenager. Her first visit to the State House as a high school freshman left a lasting impression on her. She later attended the University of New Hampshire, where she completed her senior project in American Architecture on the Legislative Office Building (LOB). Little did she know that she would be working there four decades later.

Fran graduated from Merrimack High School and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in art history from the University of New Hampshire. She furthered her education at Lesley University, where she obtained a master's in expressive therapies and art history. 

In her professional life, Fran has worked as a psychotherapist and an art therapist. She has been particularly involved with the Currier Museum of Art's program for art therapy for veterans, serving as their art therapist. Her work in this field has had a profound impact on many lives.

Fran lives in Nashua, New Hampshire, with her husband Bill Upham. They are proud parents of four grown children. Fran's commitment to her family and community is evident in her work and public service.

In her political career, Fran has been an active participant in the Hillsborough Nursing home committee at the county level. She has also endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

As a representative, Fran serves on the Committee on Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs. The committee is responsible for considering all matters concerning the health of the inhabitants of the state, vital statistics, medical and related professions, the administration of welfare activities by the state government, and matters relating to the special needs of elderly citizens.

Fran Nutter-Upham's dedication to her community, her commitment to public service, and her extensive experience make her a valued member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.
