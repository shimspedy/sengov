Representative Ellen Delana Read is a dedicated public servant who has been representing Rockingham District 17, which includes the towns of Newmarket and Newfields, in the New Hampshire House of Representatives since 2016. She has been re-elected to her fourth term in office.

Ellen serves on the Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee, a position that aligns with her passion for conservation, improvement, and preservation of fish, game, non-game species, and marine resources within the state. She is also the founder of the House Progressive Caucus, sits on the House Special Committee on Housing, chairs the Newmarket Energy and Environment Committee, and is the state lead for the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.

Ellen and her husband moved to Newmarket eleven years ago, where they reside with their three cats and two rescue parrots. She holds a Master's Degree in Environmental and Socioeconomic Ethics and Policy from the University of New Hampshire, and a Bachelor of Science in Molecular and Cellular Biology from Vanderbilt University, with a double minor in Religious Studies and Japanese.

Before being elected, Ellen worked in political advocacy and social justice in New Hampshire, including positions as a community organizer and manager at locally-based, nonpartisan nonprofits on issues which have bipartisan support, such as getting big money out of politics and restoring transparent and fair elections.

Ellen has received numerous honors for her work, including awards from American Promise, Voices of Wildlife, and the Humane Society of the United States - New Hampshire. She was also named a Woman of Excellence by the National Foundation of Women Legislators.

Ellen's core values as a legislator revolve around People, Planet, and Principles. She believes in a fair, robust economy that works for everyone, comprehensive healthcare as a human right, an equally high-quality education for every student, and debt-free college options. She also advocates for a livable wage, workers' rights, and supporting and aiding small businesses.

On the environmental front, Ellen is committed to protecting New Hampshire's natural resources, moving aggressively to renewable energy, improving public transportation, and strengthening New Hampshire's small-agriculture foundation.

Ellen is known for her upfront and honest communication, prioritizing integrity, fairness, respect, and compassion for each other despite differences. She believes in creating a healthy and robust exchange of ideas that will make the government finally work for the people again.
