Ford hails from Richmond, Virginia, and started his career with the AmeriCorps City Year New Hampshire program. It was during this time that he and his now wife fell in love with New Hampshire, particularly the potential for Manchester.

In addition to his political career, Ford is also active in the community. He serves on the board for Kinfolk Coaching, a non-profit focused on financial independence based in North Charleston, South Carolina. He is also a member of the Granite YMCA's Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion community committee, and Manchester Proud's Partnership Networking Group. Furthermore, he is an assistant coach for the Manchester Boys and Girls Club's Thunder Lacrosse.

In his limited spare time, Damond enjoys spending time with his wife and two daughters, as well as their two cats. He represents Manchester Wards: 1, 3, 10, 11, 12.

Ford ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Hillsborough 40 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. He is a first-term NH State Representative for Hillsborough District 40.
