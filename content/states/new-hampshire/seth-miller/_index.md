Seth Miller's journey into politics is rooted in his deep commitment to community and democracy. Originally from Gainesville, Florida, Miller grew up with a strong appreciation for education, inspired by his mother, who was an elementary school teacher. After moving north for college and spending nearly two decades in New York City, he relocated to Dover, New Hampshire, in 2018 with his wife. From the moment they arrived, Miller and his wife were warmly welcomed by their new neighbors, which further solidified his connection to the community.

Before entering the political arena, Miller built a diverse professional background. He worked in small businesses, held long-term contract roles in large corporations, and eventually founded his own small business. His varied experiences have given him a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities faced by individuals and businesses alike.

Miller's involvement in local government began in 2021 when he was elected as the Moderator for Dover's Ward 5, a role he continues to hold. This position allowed him to oversee the electoral process and ensure that votes were properly counted. His dedication to fair and transparent elections highlighted his passion for protecting democratic values.

As a state representative, Miller is committed to addressing critical issues such as healthcare access, education funding, and civil rights. He has been vocal about the need to protect individual freedoms and reverse policies that he believes have eroded social progress. Miller aims to make New Hampshire a more inclusive and welcoming state while strengthening its economic foundation.

Through his work in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Seth Miller strives to represent all residents of Strafford County District 21. His dedication to public service and his vision for a better future continue to drive his efforts to create meaningful change in his community and beyond.
