Geoff Smith is a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Strafford 21. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Smith ran for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives to represent Strafford 21 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. He lives in Dover, New Hampshire, and has been a resident there for nearly 13 years. His children have all been raised in Dover.

Smith is a happily married father of three children. He holds a bachelor's degree as well as a master's degree from Southern New Hampshire University. His education has led him to have a budding career in the workforce analysis field.

In the 2022 elections, Smith was elected representative for Strafford County District 21. He was involved in local government and represented Dover Wards: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. He was assigned to the House Ways and Means Committee in the 2023-2024 term.

Smith grew up in a military family, which led him to move from one posting to another. This experience allowed him to see many parts of the nation, and Dover is the place he chose to make his home and raise his family.
