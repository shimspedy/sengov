Matthew Hicks is a dedicated and accomplished public servant, currently serving as a Democratic member for the Merrimack 24th district of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Born and raised in Concord, New Hampshire, Matthew has always had a deep connection to his hometown. He grew up in East Concord on Shaker Road and now lives on Mountain Road with his spouse, two children, and a few dogs. For about a decade, he lived in the South End before moving back 'home' to East Concord.

Matthew's interest in government was evident from a young age. He attended Concord public schools through high school and went on to major in Public Policy at Hamilton College in New York. After graduating, Matthew attended the University of New Hampshire and received a Master of Arts and Teaching (History concentration) while working in Seacoast area public schools.

He then worked at Bishop Brady High School in Concord for three years before starting teaching at Shaker Road School. During his time teaching at Shaker, Matthew earned a Master of Education (Principalship concentration) at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education and then started his administrative career as Principal of Shaker Road School. Matthew eventually returned to UNH and received a doctorate in Education Leadership and Policy in 2018. Currently, Matthew continues to serve as Principal (a Head of School role) at SRS.

Matthew has always been civic-minded. He has volunteered for many years with various organizations and is currently a member of the Concord Planning Board, and on the Executive Committee of the Central NH Planning Commission. Additionally, he is a Trustee of NH Civics (Secretary).

As an avid hiker and outdoor enthusiast, Matthew spends much time in the mountains, lakes, and rivers of New Hampshire. He has hiked New Hampshire's 4,000 footers more than 100 times and completed all New England peaks with his family a few years ago. He essentially raised his children in the mountains.

Matthew's dedication to his community and his commitment to public service make him a valued member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. His work in education and his passion for civic engagement continue to drive his efforts in serving the people of Merrimack 24th district.
