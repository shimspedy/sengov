Michael Murphy has a rich background that reflects his dedication to service and community. Born and raised in Gorham, New Hampshire, he graduated from Gorham High School in 1977. Following his education, he joined the U.S. Navy Seabees, where he served for five years. His time in the military instilled in him a strong sense of discipline and commitment, qualities that he carried into his civilian life.

After his military service, Murphy pursued a career as a plumber, eventually retiring after years of hard work. He is a family man, married with seven children and eight grandchildren. His deep ties to his community are evident in his involvement in local activities and his passion for outdoor pursuits like ATV riding and golf.

Murphy's entry into politics marked his first foray into government service. He won a special election in January 2024, defeating his opponent Edith Tucker with 53% of the vote. His victory was a testament to his connection with the residents of Coos District 6 and their trust in his ability to represent their interests effectively.

In the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Murphy serves on the Fish and Game and Marine Resources Committee. This role aligns with his interest in conservation and his commitment to preserving the natural beauty and resources of his state. His work in the legislature focuses on addressing the needs of his constituents and ensuring that their voices are heard in the state government.

Murphy's journey from a Navy veteran to a state representative highlights his dedication to serving others, whether in uniform, in his trade, or in the halls of government.
