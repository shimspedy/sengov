Ernesto Leonardo Gonzalez is a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Merrimack District 3. He assumed office on December 4, 2024, and his current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Born in Havana, Cuba, Ernesto Gonzalez's life journey is a testament to resilience and determination. His family faced challenges under Fidel Castro's regime, which initially denied their exit from Cuba. However, through the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 and the sponsorship of a family member, they emigrated to the United States in 1968, settling first in Miami, Florida, and later moving to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1970.

Gonzalez's educational path reflects his commitment to learning and self-improvement. After teaching himself English, he graduated from Catholic Memorial High School in 1977. He pursued higher education at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, earning a bachelor's degree in English, American Studies, and American History in 1996. His academic achievements earned him a full scholarship to Tufts University, where he completed a Master of Arts in Education in 1997 and a Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study in Advanced Educational Research in 1998. Additionally, he obtained a Certificate in Publishing and Editing from Emerson College in 2002 and a Principal Certification from Plymouth State University in 2013.

Professionally, Gonzalez has dedicated his career to education. He has taught Spanish, U.S. history, international history, and literature, including Spanish, British, and American works. His teaching certifications span English, Social Studies, and Spanish for grades 9-12. Currently, he teaches Spanish at Newport High School in New Hampshire.

Gonzalez's involvement in local government began in 2009 when he briefly served on the Franklin School Board. Although his initial run for the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2022 was unsuccessful, he persevered and was elected in 2024. As a state representative, he is committed to upholding the principles of meritocracy and the ideals enshrined in the state and federal constitutions.

A naturalized U.S. citizen since 1980, Gonzalez is a staunch anti-Communist and a firm believer in the values of freedom and democracy. His life experiences, from his early days in Cuba to his current role in public service, have shaped his dedication to his community and his unwavering commitment to the principles of governance.
