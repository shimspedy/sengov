Representative Sly Karasinski, a member of the Republican Party, serves in the New Hampshire House of Representatives representing Cheshire District 10. He assumed office on December 4, 2024, and his current term is set to end on December 2, 2026.

Sly Karasinski has been a dedicated public servant with a long history of community involvement. A resident of Swanzey, New Hampshire, since 1994, he has deep roots in the area and a strong commitment to its well-being. Before entering politics, Karasinski built a career that combined public safety, local governance, and small business ownership. He served as Fire Chief for Swanzey Fire Rescue from 2003 to 2007, a role that highlighted his leadership and dedication to emergency response. His experience as an EMT and his work with Marlow Fire and Ambulance since 1990 further underscore his commitment to public safety.

In addition to his work in emergency services, Karasinski has been actively involved in local government. He is serving his third term on the Swanzey Selectboard, where he has worked on issues ranging from municipal management to community development. He also serves as the Water Superintendent in North Swanzey, a role that reflects his expertise in infrastructure and resource management. His diverse professional background includes working in security at Cheshire Medical and running a small business, showcasing his versatility and entrepreneurial spirit.

Karasinski's personal life is equally rooted in his community. He and his wife, Anne, have two grown children, Ben and Briana, and his mother, Sylvia, resides in nearby Keene. His family history is rich with stories of resilience and service, as his parents met in Germany after World War II under extraordinary circumstances. His father, Stanislaw, was a Polish guard who had been freed from a labor camp, and his mother was teaching at a school for military dependents.

As a legislator, Karasinski brings his wealth of experience and a deep understanding of his community's needs to the New Hampshire House of Representatives. His focus on municipal and county government issues aligns with his professional and personal dedication to improving the lives of his constituents.
