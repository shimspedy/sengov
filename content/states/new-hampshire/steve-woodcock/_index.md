Steve Woodcock's background is steeped in hard work, public service, a commitment to public education, and a deep respect for veterans, both those who have passed and those who remain. These values were ingrained in him through his upbringing in a family where everyone had a duty to contribute to the household. His father was a strong union advocate who worked at a local newspaper and always held a second job, finding time to help those in need and give back to the community. His mother, an RN, worked the night shift, while Steve and his two siblings shared the household chores.

This environment served as the incubator for Steve's work ethic and dedication to public service and education. As an Army veteran, Steve's college education was interrupted by the draft and the ongoing war, fostering his commitment to his country. After completing his Army service, he returned to college and earned his bachelor's degree. He continued his education, earning a Master of Science and a Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study (CAGS) in Educational Leadership.

Steve's professional career began as a substitute teacher and culminated as a high school principal. He also served for twelve years as a college department chair and teaching faculty member, and spent twenty years on his hometown school board. In addition to his roles in education, Steve has over twenty-five years of experience coaching and officiating at the high school and college levels.

Steve Woodcock embodies a lifetime of dedication to education, public service, and community involvement.
