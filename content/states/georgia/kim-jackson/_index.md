Senator Kim Jackson, a Democrat, was first elected to serve as the State Senator for Georgia's 41st Senate District in November of 2020. Sen. Jackson represents portions of Gwinnett and DeKalb counties in the Georgia Senate.

Sen. Jackson serves as a member on the Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, Children and Families, Public Safety, and Health and Human Services Committees.

A native of South Carolina, Sen. Jackson received her undergraduate degree from Furman University and later received a Master of Divinity from Emory University’s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta. After calling Georgia home for over a decade, Sen. Jackson was called to ministry at a young age and she started her vocation as an Episcopal priest upon completing her graduate program. Since then, Sen. Jackson has spent a decade serving in various capacities in the Episcopal Church. Sen. Jackson’s career in theological service led her to become a nationally renowned consultant and preacher.

Sen. Jackson’s current role in the church includes her service as the Vicar at the Episcopal Church of the Common Ground in Atlanta, where she has worked extensively to aid people experiencing homelessness in downtown Atlanta.

Kim and her family live in Stone Mountain. She and her wife are stewards of a small hobby farm in Georgia that hosts goats, ducks, honey bees, and chickens.
