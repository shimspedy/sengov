State Representative Stan Gunter represents the citizens of House District 8, which includes Rabun, Towns and Union counties and portions of White County. He was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2020.

Rep. Gunter was raised in Habersham County, where he graduated from Habersham Central High School in Cornelia and earned his bachelor’s degree in chemistry from North Georgia College. Upon graduation, he took a job with the Department of Agriculture as he worked his way through law school at Woodrow Wilson College of Law in Atlanta.

He began the private practice of law in Blairsville in 1991, concentrating in real estate law and litigation while raising a family and getting involved in his community. He was elected as the district attorney for the Enotah Judicial Circuit in 1999, where he served for 12 years. Rep. Gunter reorganized the District Attorney’s Office and improved case management, internal connectivity and communication, as well as implemented best-practice systems that are still utilized today. He served as president of the Georgia District Attorneys’ Association from 2003 to 2004.

In 2011, Rep. Gunter became the executive director of Georgia’s Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council, where he spent much of his time at the State Capitol. During this time, he focused on creating relationships and improving transparency within the council to better train and support Georgia’s elected and appointed prosecutors statewide. Then, he was appointed by former Governor Nathan Deal as a superior court judge for the Enotah Judicial Circuit in 2012. He served in this role until his recent retirement.

Rep. Gunter has always invested in his community, from coaching youth sports while raising his children to serving as president of the Union County Chamber of Commerce and the local Rotary Club, where he was a member for more than 20 years. He was also a member of the Atlanta Lawyers Chapter of the Federalist Society and is a member of the Leadership Georgia class of 2003.

Rep. Gunter married his wife and best friend, Rita, in 1982. They are blessed with two sons and five grandchildren. They are deeply rooted in their faith and continue to set the example for their family through strong conservative values and prioritizing service to others.
