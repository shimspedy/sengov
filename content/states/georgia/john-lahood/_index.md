“My whole life has revolved around faith, family, work and stewardship. Being raised in a family of entrepreneurs with an interesting mix in the agriculture, healthcare and hospitality industries gave me a sense of purpose and responsibility at a young age. As a third generation owner and operator of senior living communities, I am thankful for the experience and wisdom gained from  spending time with some of the finest members of the Greatest Generation. Bridging this traditional wisdom with an awareness of Georgia’s current challenges and opportunities is something I am passionate about. I am very humbled and excited about the opportunity to
represent the families and businesses of South Georgia as the State House Representative for District 175. I firmly believe that to whom much is given much is expected. I have been given many great opportunities in life and that is why I feel responsible for giving a portion of my time and energy towards helping others.”

– State Representative John LaHood

State Representative John LaHood was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives through a special election in February of 2018. In the House, he serves on several committees, including Health & Human Services, Human Relations & Aging, Game, Fish & Parks and Information and Audits. As owner and president of Fellowship Senior Living, Inc., John is responsible for business development, strategic management and general oversight of the company’s daily operations and its affiliated senior living properties, which employs approximately 250 people. He is a third generation owner and operator of assisted living and memory care communities. Beginning his full-time senior living career in 1997, he has a proven business acumen and a record of effective leadership in the industry. He was recognized in 2004 and 2006 for Best Practices in Personal Care Homes & Assisted Living Communities by the Georgia Department of Community Health and several other state associations. He served as president of the Assisted Living Association of Georgia from 2010-2013 during a period of major transition in the legislative and regulatory environment. He was an advisory workgroup member hosted by the Department of Community Health (DCH) in 2011-2012 that influenced the rules and regulations for Georgia’s new assisted living community licensure, and he continues to be on a first name basis with many DCH officials.

John is a Registered Nurse and also holds many other certifications that support him in his role as President/CEO of Fellowship Senior Living. A Georgia native, John lives within walking distance of Fellowship Home at Brookside, in Valdosta, Georgia, with his wife, Crystal. They have four children: George, Anna, Jackson and Brown.

In addition to running his business, John finds time to remain actively involved in his children’s activities and in numerous organizations, such as Leadership Georgia (Class of 2015), Georgia Senior Living Association, Assisted Living Association of Georgia (past president), Valdosta/Lowndes Chamber of Commerce, Valdosta Rotary Club and the Boys & Girls Club. John enjoys spending time outdoors on his family farm, flying and being with family and friends.
