Lisa Campbell was elected to the Georgia House Representatives in November 2022, making her the first woman to represent the Kennesaw and Acworth communities in District 35. Prior to her legislative service, Lisa had a 30-year career as an organizational consultant, working with teams to develop strategic plans, build brands, launch new technologies, and foster community collaboration and growth.

She is the Founding Partner of BRANDfit Consulting, a firm specializing in strategic communications, marketing, technology, media, public relations, advocacy, and long-range planning. Throughout her career, Lisa has consulted with many global brands, including Delta Air Lines, Gaylord Entertainment/The Grand Ole Opry, General Motors, Cadillac, SAAB, The Coca-Cola Company, The Home Depot, Graco, Calphalon, Newell Rubbermaid, and The United Way.

Lisa was born in El Paso, Texas to parents Ron Campbell, a health care CEO and hospital administrator, and Gayle Campbell, a high school biology teacher who later became one of Georgia’s first female homebuilders. Lisa's family moved to Marietta in 1978, and she attended Cobb County Public Schools, graduating from Lassiter High School. She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Georgia in 1990 with a major in English.

Lisa is actively involved in her community, serving on the board of Hope Springs Housing and supporting organizations such as The Carter Center, ACLU, GPB, The United State of Women, The Atlanta Women’s Foundation, GA Win List, Cobb Democrats, Georgia Conservancy, Fair Districts, and Planned Parenthood.

Lisa currently resides in Kennesaw and enjoys co-hosting the “Politics and Poetry” podcast with her father and niece, reading, gardening, cooking, hiking, traveling, and spending time with her family, including her beloved cocker spaniel, Lily. She is honored to serve her constituents in House District 35 and is committed to advancing responsible, proactive public policies that improve the lives of all Georgians.
