Roger Bruce was born in Harlem, New York. He attended St. Emma Military Academy and graduated after serving as the battalion executive officer and company commander, demonstrating leadership skills very early in his life. He then went on to graduate from Morehouse College, where he majored in political science. As a student, not only did he succeed academically, but he also displayed great concern for his fellow students and the next generation of students. He was president of the Political Science Club and reinstituted the Frederick Douglas Tutorial Institute to help high school students struggling in school. During college, he interned for former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson at the law firm of Jackson, Patterson, Parks and Franklin. He is married to Angela, an educator, and has three children, Andrea, Brandon and Ariel, as well as three grandchildren.

Roger Bruce represents District 61 in the Georgia House of Representatives. His district includes parts of South Fulton County, which includes parts of the recently formed City of South Fulton, North Atlanta, Douglas County and Cobb County. He was first elected in 2003 and has been reelected every two years since then. During his time in office, Rep. Bruce has focused on issues related to children with special needs, the aging, education, working families, economic development, voting rights and criminal justice. He has served on the Insurance, Education, Motor Vehicles, MARTOC and Intergovernmental Coordination committees. He currently serves on the Appropriations, Judiciary, Game Fish & Parks, Small Business Development and Human Relations & Aging committees.

His first major piece of legislation was to provide for a licensing process for developers in response to elderly constituents that were being taken advantage of. He then sponsored the “Time Out for Schools” legislation to protect parents that needed time off from work to address issues at their child’s school. After being asked to provide the same protection for parents who were providing assistance to their aging parents, the bill was amended and became known as the Parent Protection Act, receiving support from many groups, including the Georgia Federation of Teachers, Georgia Council on Aging, AFL-CIO, PAGE, Georgia PTA, AARP and many more. He also sponsored a bill that was signed into law in June 2013 to prohibit internet companies from charging a fee to remove mug shots from their sites if you have been exonerated for the offense you were accused of. He has also introduced legislation to assist minority and women entrepreneurs with accessing state contracts.

During the 2017 legislative session, he sponsored House Bill 22, which would allow citizens to vote at any precinct within their county versus having to go to a specified location to vote. He also introduced House Bill 21 during the 2017 legislative session to assist minorities in accessing state contracts. In 2016, he sponsored House Bill 514, which allowed citizens of unincorporated South Fulton County the opportunity to vote to establish their own city. Voters overwhelmingly chose to create what is now the City of South Fulton. His campaign slogan “Bruce Will Produce…Again” is most appropriate.

Rep. Bruce has served twice as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, which gave him the opportunity to vote for President Obama to be the Democratic presidential nominee. He is a post seat holder for the Democratic Party and in his earlier days, served as the vice president for the Young Democrats of Georgia. He has been recognized for his work by many organizations, including A. Phillip Randolph Elementary School, Herndon Elementary School, All Children Are Special, Another Way Out, Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, National Coalition of 100 Black Women and the Georgia Council on Aging. The Atlanta Police Department recognized him for his efforts to protect the officers by organizing the community and business owners in raising money to purchase bulletproof vests.

He currently serves on the Board of Trustees at the Interdenominational Theological Center, the Board of Directors for Fulton Atlanta Community Action Authority, Inc. and All Children Are Special. He is a member of Leadership Atlanta Class of 1980 and the 2006 Class of the Flemming Leadership Institute.

Outside of his community and government responsibilities, Rep. Bruce has had a distinguished career as a Human Resources Executive, having served as vice president of human resources for Burger King Corporation, American Hospital Supply, Nation Wide Credit Corporation and Atlanta Life Financial Group. In these roles, he was responsible for recruitment and retention, training and management development, legal compliance, benefits and all other aspects of human resources.

He was the founder of Saving Our Society (SOS) Pretrial Intervention, LLC. The company works with first time offenders and others that have minor infractions and assists them to get back on track. Once they complete the program, they will be eligible to have their arrest record removed. While he has left SOS to pursue other interests, his impact on the lives of those that were kept out of the prison system, and because of his work, will last a lifetime.
