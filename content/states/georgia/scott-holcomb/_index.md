Scott Holcomb represents District 101 in the Georgia House of Representatives and serves
on the following committees: Rules; Appropriations; Judiciary; Ways & Means; Public
Safety and Homeland Security; Defense & Veterans Affairs; Higher Education and
Technology & Infrastructure Innovation.

In the legislature, Scott has passed several bills to reform the state’s laws and policies
concerning sexual assault. These include Senate Bill 304 (2016) to address the backlog of
untested sexual assault kits; House Bill 282 (2019) to preserve sexual assault kits; and
House Bill 255 (2021) to establish, among other things, a statewide sexual assault tracking
system.

Scott passed legislation to establish benefit corporations in Georgia. In addition, he has led
efforts to reform the state’s approach to compensating those who are wrongfully convicted.
He passed a resolution to compensate Kerry Robinson, who was exonerated in 2020. Mr.
Robinson spent more than 17 years in prison for a crime that he did not commit, and DNA
played a critical role in his exoneration.

Scott also championed legislation that allows victims of domestic violence to break their
leases without an early termination penalty. This legislation has helped to make it
economically possible for victims of domestic violence to move away from dangerous
situations.
Scott’s ultimate legislative goal is for Georgia to expand Medicaid so that hundreds of
thousands of Georgians would gain access to health insurance.

With respect to Scott’s work experience, he is a veteran who served for twelve years: six
years in the Air National Guard and six years on active duty. He began his legal career in the
U.S. Army, where he served as a prosecutor and as a legal advisor on international law and
the laws of war. He was stationed at both Fort Stewart and Fort McPherson in Georgia and
deployed overseas three times in support of U.S Army operations. From 2001-2003, Scott provided legal advice to commanding generals during the initial phases of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Following his military service, Scott entered the private sector and focused his law practice
on litigation. Initially, he worked for a large, prominent law firm in Atlanta, and then later,
he co-founded Holcomb + Ward, LLP, a boutique law firm that handles complex cases
across the country.

Scott is a strong advocate for veterans’ issues and he has provided pro bono representation
to veterans and their families since leaving active duty. He serves on the Military Legal
Assistance Committee of the State Bar of Georgia and he is a member of Iraq and
Afghanistan Veterans of America, the American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars.
Scott taught part-time at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at Georgia Tech. He
is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and he has appeared on CNN, NPR, BBC
Radio, and other media outlets to discuss foreign policy and domestic politics.

Scott earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Connecticut, a law degree from
West Virginia University, a master of business administration from the University of
Georgia, a master of public administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, and a master of public health from the University of Michigan.

Scott is married to the former Kathleen Oh of Reidsville, Georgia. They have a son, Carter,
and a daughter, Kirsten, and attend Immaculate Heart of Mary Church.
Lastly, Scott believes that Val Kilmer is the greatest actor to ever live, and this is reflected in
his Capitol office.
