Shea Roberts is a member of the Democratic Party and represents District 52 in the Georgia House of Representatives. She assumed office on January 11, 2021, and her current term ends on January 13, 2025. She ran for re-election to the Georgia House of Representatives to represent District 52 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Shea Roberts was born in Dalton, Georgia, and she is an attorney by profession. She completed her education in Law at The Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law, in 1996. Her career experience includes working as an attorney and owning a business. She has served with the Agape Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and Buckhead Christian Ministries.

In addition to her legal career, Shea Roberts is a small business owner, focused primarily on land use and family law. She reads and interprets legislation every day, knows how to advocate for issues she believes in, and understands how to bring opposing parties together on complex emotional issues that impact families, homes, and neighborhoods for years.

Shea Roberts is also a mother and has three children in her blended family. She met Brian in 2006, who became her partner in work and in life. They inspire and motivate her every day. She has spent the past two decades serving Sandy Springs and Atlanta families through her zoning firm.

Shea Roberts is an active member of her community and has always been inspired by service. In law school, she helped form the first campus organization dedicated to discussing women's health and equality issues and was incredibly honored to work with Special Olympics International. She has also been able to share her passion for public service with her daughter through the National Charity League, volunteering alongside her at local philanthropies such as the Agape Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Buckhead Christian Ministries, City of Refuge, Northside Senior Services, and others.

Shea Roberts stepped up to run when she watched yet another community be devastated by gun violence. But she is also just a regular person – your colleague, your neighbor, your friend – who wants to change our state’s political climate and restore some decency, common sense, and progressive thinking to it in the process. She is incredibly grateful to all the people who supported her during her campaign and continue to support her now as the representative for House District 52. It is her honor to represent every citizen in her district, even those who did not vote for her.
