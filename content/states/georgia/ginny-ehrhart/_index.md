Representative Ginny Ehrhart represents House District 36, which includes portions of western Cobb County. Ginny has resided in Cobb County for more than 45 years. As the daughter of a U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, she was raised on U.S. Army bases across the country, eventually settling with her family in Cobb County. She attended Osborne High School and graduated from Auburn University with a degree in international trade. She taught high school economics and American government and also home schooled her children before starting a successful small business.

Ginny was a frequent speaker on regional and national television and radio, writing and teaching about the art of southern cuisine and hospitality. She was a television chef and home life consultant for Family Net Television, authoring two cookbooks, Sunday in the South and Seasons in the South. She hosted a highly regarded weekly lifestyle show on 920AM Atlanta.

Ginnyâ€™s merits as a hands-on small business owner and entrepreneur influence her conservative-minded policy platform. Public safety, pro-business initiatives and education are priorities. She brings a broad, pragmatic and solution-oriented perspective to public service that she believes citizens want under the Gold Dome.

Ginny and her husband, Earl, live in Powder Springs and are parents to six grown children, four grandchildren and a talented Australian shepherd named Dixie.
