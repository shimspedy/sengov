Representative Trey Kelley grew up in Cedartown, Georgia, and was raised by Doyle and Laura Kelley, both educators in the Polk County School District. A 2008 graduate of Shorter University, Trey graduated with his Juris Doctorate degree from Georgia State University College of Law in May 2014. Trey is employed as an attorney with the Parker & Lundy Law Firm on Main Street in Cedartown.

Staying active in the community, Trey has held multiple leadership roles, such as president of the Cedartown Exchange Club, vice-chairman of the Board for the Murphy-Harpst Children’s Centers, Polk County chairman of Governor Deal’s 2010 and 2014 gubernatorial campaigns and chairman of the Polk County Republican Party.

First elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2012, Trey has proven himself to be an effective conservative leader for his constituents both at home in House District 16 and at the State Capitol. Trey has consistently promoted his beliefs of limited government and lower taxes to put forth common sense legislation aimed to drive growth in our private sector.

In the Georgia State House, Trey is a member of the Code Revision, Energy, Utilities & Telecommunications, Health, Higher Education, Judiciary and Ways & Means committees.
