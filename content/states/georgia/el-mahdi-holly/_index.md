State Representative El-Mahdi Holly has proudly called Henry County home since 2003. Raised in Georgia by his father, a Christian minister and businessman, and his mother, a local college professor, El-Mahdi was taught the importance of serving his community at a very early age. After being awarded the National Youth Service Award from President Bill Clinton for his efforts mentoring young teens, El-Mahdi pursued and received a Bachelor of Arts from Morehouse College. He went on to earn a Masters of Public Administration from University of West Georgia with a specialized concentration in strategic planning and management of public service organizations.

El-Mahdi has enjoyed an extensive career working for local and national charitable organizations to better advocate for social justice, build interfaith community networks, provide job training programs and to protect youth and young adults from the dangers of sex trafficking. For over five years, El-Mahdi served as a senior law clerk and criminal warrant officer supporting responsible law enforcement and the judiciary. His career also includes serving as a regional political field director where he managed 26 Georgia counties for the Democratic Party of Georgia. He has also served as at-large corporate engagement director for the Morehouse College Atlanta Alumni Association and remains an avid community organizer.

A proud member of Tabernacle of Praise Church in McDonough, El-Mahdi is employed with the Henry County Board of Education, servicing Eagles Landing Middle School.

As the state representative for House District 111, El-Mahdi intends to serve the working families of Georgia. The district, which is located exclusively within Henry County, covers portions of the cities of Hampton, Locust Grove, McDonough, Stockbridge, Jonesboro and Jenkinsburg.
