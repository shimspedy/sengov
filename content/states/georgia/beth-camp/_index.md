State Representative Beth Camp represents the citizens of House District 131, which includes portions of Pike, Lamar, and Upson counties. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2020.

Rep. Camp began her career as a 911 dispatcher at 17 years old, which led to her becoming a licensed emergency medical technician. Her work in public safety sparked her interest in social sciences and volunteerism. She earned an associate degree in science from Georgia Military College, a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Studies with a concentration in psychology from Clayton State University, and a Master of Arts from the University of Alabama in communication studies.

Professionally, Rep. Camp is a licensed real estate broker in Georgia and currently serves as a managing broker for Coldwell Banker Bullard Realty in Zebulon. She has been a licensed realtor since 2006 and holds the “Lifetime Multi-Million Dollar Realtor” achievement for her professional efforts. She is also a member of the Heart of Georgia Board of Realtors, serving as the 2020 vice president of community relations and the 2019-2020 chair of the local GARPAC Committee, promoting property owners’ rights.

She serves on the board of directors for CASA Advo-Kids, a court-appointed special advocacy for children in foster care for Fayette, Pike, Spalding, and Lamar Counties. She is a member of the Pike County FFA Alumni Board, Pike County Arts Council, Pike County Chamber of Commerce, Thomaston-Upson Chamber of Commerce, and the Georgia Association of Realtors. She is a recipient of chapter and state Future Farmers of American (FFA) degrees for volunteer work in the organization, including fundraising to build a barn at a local high school for STEM classes. She has also been a Girl Scout leader, a delegate at the Georgia Republican Convention, secretary of the Georgia Lamb Producers Association, and a volunteer for many local civic groups. From 2017-2020, Rep. Camp served as an elected member of the Pike County Board of Education.

Rep. Camp is the daughter of Warren and Beverly Thompson of Rincon, Georgia. She met her husband of more than 25 years, Mark, when they were working as medics. Their daughter, Meredith, is a senior studying psychology and sociology at the University of Georgia in Athens. Rep. Camp and her family enjoy living in Concord on their cattle production farm with a miniature donkey, a confusion of guineas, several barn cats, and a Jack Russell Terrier named Trixie.
