State Representative Marvin Lim represents the citizens of House District 98, which includes portions of Gwinnett County. He was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2020. Rep. Lim immigrated to Georgia from the Philippines at the age of seven. Benefitting from various forms of public assistance growing up, he eventually earned his Bachelor of Arts from Emory University, where he graduated magna cum laude.

He performed job development for refugees and immigrants on behalf of Catholic Charities Atlanta and testified for the first time at the state House in 2009. He later obtained his Juris Doctor degree at Yale Law School, where he was awarded the Benjamin N. Cardozo Prize for moot court.

Rep. Lim has established a career in both civil rights and securities law and has been with Holcomb + Ward, LLP since 2015. As a Fulbright Scholar and a term member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Rep. Lim has also been a frequent writer on law and religion issues and the ethics of life.

He is also an avid marathoner and an Ironman.
