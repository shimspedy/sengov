State Representative Spencer Frye was first elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2012, representing House District 118, which includes portions of Athens and Winterville. He currently serves as the executive director for Athens Habitat for Humanity.

In addition to his political career, Spencer has been a small business owner and a construction manager. He has helped to export American ambulances overseas and co-founded a company that began by recapturing recyclable motor oil and which now operates globally. As a business owner, non-profit director, and state representative, Spencer has met and worked with people from all over the community and successfully balanced the interests of citizens, private enterprise, and government.

His wife, Gretchen, is an emergency room nurse at Piedmont Athens Regional Hospital and his two children attend public school in Athens Clarke County. An entrepreneur at heart, Spencer is optimistic about the future and what can be accomplished with the right vision and a little shoe leather.
