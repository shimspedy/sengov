Will Wade, born as William Solomon Wade on March 25, 1978, is a distinguished American politician from Georgia. He is a member of the Republican party and currently serves as a representative for the 9th district in the Georgia House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 11, 2021, succeeding Kevin Tanner.

Born and raised in Dawsonville, Georgia, Wade completed his high school education at Dawson County High School. He then attended the North Georgia College and State University, where he pursued a double major in finance and accounting, graduating in 2001.

In his personal life, Wade is happily married to Dr. Jennifer Sheffield-Wade, an educator for the Lumpkin County School District. The couple resides in Dawsonville with their two children. They are practicing Christians.

Wade's professional journey began in college when he worked as a full-time bank teller. After graduation, he continued in the banking sector, working as a community banker. He currently holds the position of Senior Vice President of Commercial Relations for River City Bank, operating within Dawson County.

Wade's political career started in 2004 when he became a member of the Dawson County Board of Education. He was elected Chairman of the Board in 2011 and served for 15 years. He has also held various leadership positions in the Dawson County Rotary Club and served as a past-president of the Georgia School Boards Association. In 2017, he was recognized by Georgia Trend Magazine on their "40 Under 40" list.

In 2019, Governor Kemp appointed Wade to serve on the Georgia Student Finance Commission. He worked closely with the Georgia Department of Education to provide funding for high school students to move to higher education. His wife, Dr. Jennifer Sheffield-Wade, was simultaneously appointed to serve on the Georgia Professional Standards Commission, which oversees the certification of Georgia educators.

In 2020, Wade ran for a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives following incumbent Kevin Tanner's decision to run for U.S. House. Wade's campaign emphasized his passion for small business and education. He was elected on November 3, 2020, winning 83.9% of the vote in the District 9 general election. He assumed office on January 11, 2021. Wade was later re-elected on November 8, 2022, running uncontested.

On January 19, 2023, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp selected Wade to serve as a floor leader for the 2023-2024 General Assembly.
