Matthew Gambill is a life-long resident of Bartow County and comes from a family with a long record of service to his community. His grandfather, Frank Harris, moved to Cartersville in the 1920s and made numerous personal sacrifices to help create the thriving community we enjoy today—from chairing the Cartersville City School Board, to helping organize Faith United Methodist Church, and using his own resources to finance trips to recruit manufacturers to Bartow County in the 1950’s and 60’s. His uncle, Joe Frank Harris, represented Bartow County in the Georgia House of Representatives for 18 years prior to serving as Georgia’s Governor from 1983-1991. Matthew’s parents, Bill and Glenda Gambill, are both retired from careers in public education which instilled in him a deep appreciation for education. He is a graduate of Cartersville High School and holds degree in Political Science from Lee University.

Matthew currently serves as Business Development Manager for Parrish Construction Group. In this role, Gambill, is responsible for leading Parrish’s industrial and higher education initiatives, driving revenue, maintaining and growing business relationships, and is a key part of the implementation of new business. Since 1995, Parrish Construction Group has established itself as one of the most reputable and technically advanced Construction Managers in the state of Georgia with a focus on education, healthcare and industrial construction.

Prior to joining Parrish, he spent 4 years in business development with NFP Corporate Benefits, and prior to that over 14 years building relationships in the public and private sector serving as Executive Director for the Georgia Association for Career & Technical Education.

Active in his community, Matthew is a member of the Cartersville-Bartow County Chamber of Commerce, Georgia Economic Developers Association, serves on the Board of Directors of the Indian Springs Holiness Camp Meeting, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Bartow County, Recovery Bartow, and is the Past Chair of the Boys and Girls Clubs Georgia Area Council and MurphyHarpst Children’s Home.

Gambill is a graduate of the 2007 Leadership Bartow Class, a graduate of the 2010 Leadership Georgia Class, and was selected by Georgia Trend Magazine for their 2012 “40 Under 40” publication.

Committed to faith and family, Matthew and his wife Danae are the proud parents of 3 children—Mary Harris, David, and James. The Gambills are members of Tabernacle Baptist Church where they are actively involved. In 2018, Gambill was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives from District 15, which encompasses Cartersville, Emerson and Allatoona, along with portions of unincorporated Bartow County.
