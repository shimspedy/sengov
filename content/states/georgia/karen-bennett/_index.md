State Representative Karen Leeper Bennett is a native of Richmond, Virginia. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy from Howard University, a Master of Science in Exercise Physiology from Georgia State University, a Master of Divinity from Candler School of Theology at Emory University, and a Doctor of Physical Therapy from Alabama State University.

Rep. Bennett has resided in DeKalb County since moving to Georgia in 1985. In 2012, she was first elected to serve in the Georgia General Assembly as the state representative of House District 94, which includes portions of DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. She was reelected in November 2022.

She serves on several influential House committees, including the Public Health, Economic Development and Tourism, Regulated Industries, Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, and Code Revision committees. Rep. Bennett also serves as the vice chairman of the Georgia House Democratic Caucus, member of the DeKalb and Gwinnett House legislative delegations, and vice chairman of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators Region VI, which includes Georgia and Florida. She also serves as a state director for Women In Government (WIG).

Most notably, Rep. Bennett co-authored House Bill 426, Georgia’s historic hate crimes legislation, in 2020. Before the passage of HB 426, Georgia was one of five remaining states without a hate crimes law.

Additionally, Rep. Bennett has championed several health care initiatives throughout her time under the Gold Dome. She helped expand access to services for children with special needs and their families. She also helped add children diagnosed with sickle cell disease to the state’s medical cannabis registry and led efforts to increase public awareness to breast cancer screening and early awareness services.

Rep. Bennett also founded the “Emma B. Allen Pink Sash Parade.” This signature event launched nearly 10 years ago to celebrate breast cancer survivors, shed light on the importance of early detection, and promote the latest innovations in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Professionally, Rep. Bennett is a licensed Doctor of Physical Therapy and is the president and CEO of Metro Therapy Providers, Inc., which is a pediatric therapy provider offering physical, occupational, and speech therapy to her clients. She is a life member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., DeKalb NAACP, Order of Eastern Star, and other civic and professional organizations. She currently serves as a member of the DeKalb Charter Commission and the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority Board of Trustees.

In addition to working as a professional and community advocate, Rep. Bennett is an ordained itinerant elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and serves as a senior pastor in the AME Church.

Rep. Karen Bennett and Leroy Bennett are the proud parents of two adult children, Jabari and Asha. Jabari is an attorney, and Asha works as a biological scientist. Rep. Bennett’s love for God, family, and people is exemplified in all aspects of her life through her ministry, public, and community service. She believes that “Only What You Do for Christ Shall Last.”
