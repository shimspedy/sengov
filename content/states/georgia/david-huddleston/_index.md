State Representative David Huddleston was elected to the House of Representatives in 2022 and serves the citizens of House District 72, which includes portions of Carroll, Heard and Troup counties.

David is a fifth generation farmer from Carrollton and currently resides on his family farm in Roopville, where he and his son, Andrew, operate their cow-calf operation, chicken houses, hayfields and beehives. His greatest accomplishment is working alongside his son and passing down the knowledge, expertise and drive that it takes to be a farmer.

As a state legislator, he is interested in legislation that would encourage small businesses and local economies, modernize law enforcement equipment, training and techniques, as well as securing resources for local school districts in District 72. Furthermore, he seeks to support rural communities through legislation that would promote farming, agriculture and enhancement initiatives, such as broadband.

David recently retired after 36 years with Carroll Electric Cooperative. During his career, he was the purchasing and agribusiness relations manager and oversaw materials and warehousing, fleet and automotive, special projects and agribusiness efforts. Additionally, Rep. Huddleston is a recent graduate of the University of Georgia’s Advancing Georgia Leaders in Agriculture program, an extensive two-year educational program that concluded with a two-week farming study in Costa Rica.

He is also a member of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and president of the Carroll County Young Farmers Association, where David played a critical role in growing membership from 30 to more than 200 and becoming one of the largest in the state. Rep. Huddleston also established a jacket scholarship for FFA and hosted more than 300 participating FFA students from seven counties for an ag-educational day at Carroll EMC. He is still active in his local FFA and 4-H programs today.

He is also the past president of the Heard County Cattlemen’s Association and serves as a member of four surrounding chapters. He works with UGA extension offices covering six counties, 10 area FFA and 4-H programs, Carroll County Chamber of Commerce Agribusiness Committee and is the founder of the West Georgia Agribusiness Relations Committee.
