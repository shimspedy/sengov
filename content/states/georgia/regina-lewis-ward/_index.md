State Representative Regina Lewis-Ward is a native of Brooklyn, New York. She grew up in New York City public housing and attended public schools. She earned a BBA in computer systems from Bernard M. Baruch College and an MA in political science from Clayton State University. In 2020, she became the first African American elected to represent Georgia's 109th House District. She is also an adjunct professor and children’s book author.

In her early career, Rep. Lewis-Ward served as a shop steward with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union (AFSCME) to help protect employee rights. After more than 20 years as a manager with NYC Transit, Lewis-Ward retired and relocated to Georgia.

In 2014, Rep. Lewis-Ward joined the Stockbridge City Council. As a councilmember, she secured federal funds to upgrade Memorial and Clark public parks with adaptable playground equipment and created the first Stockbridge Citizens Academy.

Elected to the General Assembly in 2020, Rep. Lewis-Ward partnered with the Gordon State College Foundation to establish an empowerment scholarship for women interested in American politics. The scholarship aims to help address the underrepresentation of African American women in public office. She also helped secure almost $400,000 in the state’s Fiscal Year 2022 budget for students in her district to participate in the American Association of Adapted Sports Program. That same year, she helped allocate $39,000 for the startup costs of a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) program in Henry County. In 2023, the Georgia House passed House Bill 144, the George Burgess Act, which was introduced by Rep. Lewis-Ward to strengthen the rights of adult wards under guardianship.

Rep. Lewis-Ward currently serves on the House Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, Banks and Banking, Interstate Cooperation and Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications committees. Due to the 2020 U.S. Census, Rep. Lewis-Ward now represents the 115th House District, located exclusively in Henry County.
