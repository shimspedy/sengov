Representative Lydia Glaize is a proud mother of seven, with deep roots tracing back to her family of sharecroppers from Georgia and Alabama. They moved to New Jersey in the 1950s, seeking a better life. Her journey began early; at just seven years old, she became a cornerstone of her family's welfare. She spent her childhood with her hands in the soil, under the sun, working in fields to support her family. This experience taught her the value of hard work, selflessness, and the importance of advocating for herself and others.

As the eldest daughter and the first in her family to graduate from college, she opened the door for her siblings to pursue higher education. Her life is a story of overcoming obstacles, fueled by dreams and servant-leadership, leading to the upward mobility of her family against all odds.

In 2023, she was honored to assume office as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives for District 67, following her victory in the November 8, 2022, general election. Serving in this role, her responsibilities include being a part of the Education Committee, the House Higher Education Committee, and the Information and Audits Committee. These assignments are a testament to her commitment to shaping impactful public policy, particularly in the realms of education and governance, both in our district and across the state.

Her mission as a representative is centered on three key pillars: educational recovery, economic empowerment, and environmental sustainability. She is dedicated to advocating for effective educational recovery strategies, ensuring our public schools are fully funded, and expanding opportunities for apprenticeships. Her focus on economic development is rooted in supporting a living wage and fostering regional economic growth through job creation and entrepreneurship. Environmental sustainability is also a crucial aspect of her work, where she aims to ensure safe practices in our local landfills and protect our waterways.

Together, we can create a brighter future for our district, one that is grounded in education, economic prosperity, and environmental responsibility.
