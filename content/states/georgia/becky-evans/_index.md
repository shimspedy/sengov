State Representative Becky Evans serves House District 83, which includes portions of DeKalb County. She graduated from Emory University with a political science degree and then worked for 11 years as an educator and project manager with HBO and Company, a healthcare technology company.

Becky coordinated Kathie Gannon’s campaign for election as DeKalb Super District Commissioner in 2012. From 2014 through 2016, she served as a State Senator Elena Parent’s Aide on local issues, was an active volunteer in the 2008 and 2012 Organizing for America campaigns and in Michelle Nunn’s 2014 bid for US Senate. She has also campaigned for Stacey Abrams, Sarah Riggs Amico, and other state-wide Democratic candidates.

Becky and her husband, David, raised their three adult children in DeKalb County, all of whom attended Druid Hills High School. As a 25-year DeKalb County homeowner and 18-year volunteer with DeKalb public schools, she has dedicated her life to leading through service as a non-profit co-founder, community volunteer, political aide, advocate, and mother.

Becky learned early the importance of service to others and advocating for the vulnerable from watching her parents’ lives and careers. Her father was a Methodist minister, New Testament professor, and civil rights activist in Dallas, Texas. His legacy of bridging faiths, races, and cultures by advocating for economic and social justice is a profound influence on her decision to run for House District 83. Becky’s mother was a preschool teacher and a realtor. Between the two of them, she learned the importance of compassion, community, and collaborative problem solving.

Becky’s family is active at North Decatur Presbyterian Church, where they have been members for 30 years. She is also a co-founder of the nonprofit called the Druid Hills Athletic Association, a school-wide booster club that broadens support for athletics at Druid Hills High School and Middle School, which just celebrated its 10-year anniversary.

Becky’s community services include:
- Volunteer and leader in her children’s public schools for 18 years (1995-2013)
- Co-chair of Global Mission Committee at N. Decatur Presbyterian Church (2012-present)
- Founder and former president of Druid Hills Athletic Association (2007-2013)
- Steering Committee member for the Haiti Eco Village School Partnership, which is building a self-sustaining school in rural Haiti (2014-present)
- DeKalb Green Commission Advisory Board (2009-2012)
- Board member of Druid Hills Civic Association (2007-present)
- Board member of Emory Village Alliance (2010-present)
- Member of Druid Hills Tour of Homes Planning Committee (2003-present)
- Chair of Open Streets Emory Village (2017-2018)
- Community Development for Burbanck Park (2006-2009)
- Community development chair for Emory Village Plaza (2010-2013)
- Girl scout troop leader (2001-2007)
- Advocate for Presbyterians for a Better Georgia (2014-present)
- Advocate for Georgia Interfaith Power and Light (2013-present)

One thing has stayed with Becky since her last year at Emory – when she was a member of the first class of interns at the Carter Center. Becky’s family has supported the Carter Center’s work for the past two decades, and President Carter is a life-long role model. He said, quoting his beloved teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, “We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.”

Becky is humbled and honored to be a state representative and looks forward to going to work for her district at the State Capitol.
