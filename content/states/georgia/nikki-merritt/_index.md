Senator Nikki Merritt, a Democrat, was elected to the State Senate in 2020. She represents the 9th District, which includes portions of Gwinnett County. Sen. Merritt formerly spent 23 years in a service career in telecommunications, where she supported her local labor union, CWA 3204.

Sen. Merritt currently serves as a member on the Senate Committees on Children and Families, Government Oversight, Insurance and Labor, Natural Resources and the Environment, and Urban Affairs. She also serves as Chair of the Gwinnett County Senate Delegation and Vice Chair of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus.

From a young age, Sen. Merritt’s parents instilled in her a passion for social justice, as they grew up during an era of racial segregation and participated in the fight for civil rights. This passion has fueled Sen. Merritt’s determination to make Georgia a fairer and more just state.

She is an active participant in her community and has volunteered for the nonprofit Community Action Network Initiatives, Inc. (C.A.N.I.) and the Gwinnett Democratic Party to personally register voters in her district. As a C.A.N.I. board member, she helps to coordinate events for community engagement and empowerment throughout Gwinnett County. Additionally, she has served as a member of CWA Local 3204 and is currently a lifetime council member, and serves on the advisory board for Gwinnett Reentry Alliance and as a member of Leadership Gwinnett, Class of 2024.

Sen. Merritt grew up in Austell, GA, and attended Pebblebrook High School, the University of Georgia and Georgia State University. She is a 16-year resident of Gwinnett County and currently resides in Grayson with her husband, two children and two dogs. Her two children are both graduates of Gwinnett County public schools and are attending universities in Georgia.
