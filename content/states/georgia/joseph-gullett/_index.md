Joseph Brian Gullett, born on March 27, 1980, is an American politician who currently serves as a Georgia State Representative for the 19th District. He was elected in 2018 and assumed office on January 14, 2019.

Gullett's political journey began when he defeated the long-term incumbent Paulette Rakestraw in a Republican party runoff in July 2018. His campaign was endorsed by the Paulding County sheriff, which played a significant role in his victory.

In his role as a State Representative, Gullett has been actively involved in various committees. He serves as the vice chairman of the Energy, Utilities, and Telecommunications committee and the Code Revision committee. He is also the secretary of Governmental Affairs and a member of the Insurance, Appropriations, Interstate Cooperation, and Juvenile Justice committees.

Throughout his tenure, Gullett has proposed and sponsored several pieces of legislation. In 2019, he proposed a bill to prevent railroad companies from blocking train crossings for extended periods. In 2021, he was the lead sponsor for legislation that restricts local Governments from fining alarm companies for false alarms when the false alarms were not the fault of the company.

Gullett also led the sponsorship on legislation that would restrict local boards of elections from accepting private money. This was eventually embedded in the Election Integrity Act of 2021. Additionally, he sponsored a bill that would allow Remote Online Notary in Georgia and legislation that would create an oversight commission for District Attorneys across the state.

Gullett resides in Dallas, Georgia, and is a technology professional by occupation. He is married to Jessica.
