Committed to the principles of human dignity and constitutionally limited government, Senator Setzler serves on the Senate Judiciary, Health & Human Services, Education, and Science & Technology Committees.

Throughout his time in the legislature, Ed has worked a challenging full-time job as a leader in the architecture, engineering, and environmental consulting industry where he has directed nationwide design programs for more than 20 years. A graduate of the US Army Ranger School, Ed earned a BS in Physics from Furman University in 1992 and served on active duty for nine years as a US Army officer with leadership assignments in Europe, the US, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf.
