John Carson was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in an October 2011 special election run-off. He represents the 46th House District, which includes northeast Cobb and southeast Cherokee Counties. He currently serves on several committees, including Retirement (Chairman), Appropriations (Ex-Officio), Ways & Means, Rules, Transportation, Energy Utilities & Telecommunications, State Planning & Community Affairs, Intragovernmental Coordination, and the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Overview Committee (MARTOC).

An Atlanta native, John was raised in a family that encouraged conservative values, the importance of education, and a strong work ethic. His late father was an engineer for Georgia Power and a small business owner. His mother raised three sons and worked in counseling roles at charitable organizations.

John has 18 years of Georgia public education, including a BBA in Accounting from Georgia State University and an MBA in Finance from Kennesaw State University. He is a CPA and is employed with State Tax Incentives. John was previously employed with KPMG, GE Capital, and SunTrust.

John belongs to several civic and professional organizations, including the Georgia Chamber of Commerce (Board of Directors), Cobb Chamber of Commerce, MUST Ministries (Board of Directors), Georgia Society of CPAs, Northeast Cobb Business Association, and the National Distracted Driving Coalition of the NTSB. He also has prior experience with the Boy Scouts of America (Eagle Scout, 1989), Cobb County Commission for Children and Youth (treasurer, member of Executive Committee), Rotary International, YoungLife, Alpha Ministries, and the Kennesaw State University Graduate Student Association (past president).

Having served in the General Assembly for more than 10 years, John has sponsored numerous bills that have been signed into law. His two biggest accomplishments include authoring and championing House Bill 673, Georgiaâ€™s Hands-Free Law, as well as increasing the Qualified Education Expense (SSO) program to $100 million through House Bill 217; both of these bills were passed during the 2018 legislative session.

John and his wife, Beverly, have been married since 2005 and have two children. Their family attends Johnson Ferry Baptist Church and previously attended Mount Paran North Church of God for more than 10 years.
