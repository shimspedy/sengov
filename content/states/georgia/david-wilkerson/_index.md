In the previous terms, he also served on the House Ethics Committee, House Rules Committee, and House Science and Technology Committee.

In February 2019, Wilkerson was unanimously elected chair of the Cobb County legislative delegation, following a period of dispute after the county's shift from Republican to Democratic in the 2018 midterm elections.
