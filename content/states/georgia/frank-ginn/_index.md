Senator Frank Ginn, a Republican, was elected to the Georgia Senate in 2010. He represents the 47th District, which includes Barrow, Jackson, Clarke, and Madison Counties. Following his family tradition, he graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering in 1985.

He began his career in the electric utility industry as an engineer for the consumer-owned cooperative, Jackson EMC. He then served as the City Manager/Treasurer for the City of Royston to learn more about natural gas and other utilities. Later, he served as the manager for the City of Sugar Hill in Gwinnett County. In 2000, when the citizens of Franklin County voted to change to the County Manager form of government, Frank was selected to serve as the first county manager.

In the Senate, Senator Ginn serves as Chair of the State and Local Governmental Operations Committee, Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Government Operations, and Vice-Chairman on the Senate Committee on Rules. Additionally, he serves on the Senate Committee on Transportation and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and Natural Resources. He also serves as Ex-Officio on the Senate Committees on Natural Resources and the Environment and Regulated Industries and Utilities.

Senator Ginn considers it a great honor to represent the citizens in the 47th District and to serve the people of Georgia.
