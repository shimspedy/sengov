Mack Jackson, a member of the Democratic Party, has been serving in the Georgia House of Representatives since January 12, 2009. He represents District 128 and his current term is set to end on January 13, 2025. He successfully ran for re-election to the Georgia House of Representatives to represent District 128 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Born and raised in Sandersville, Washington County, Georgia, Mack Jackson is married to Valarie Jackson and they have two sons, Michael and Daryl. He attended Albany State College for two years and later graduated from Georgia College and State University with a degree in Political Science.

In terms of professional experience, Jackson has worked as a partner with Benchmark Partners, LLC, served as a Pastor at St. James Christian Fellowship, Inc., worked as an office manager with the Sandersville Probation Office, and in the Georgia Department of Labor.

Over the years, Jackson has been assigned to various committees. For the 2023-2024 term, he was assigned to the following committees: House Appropriations Committee, House Health and Human Services Committee, Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee, House Rules Committee, Small Business Development Committee, State Planning and Community Affairs Committee, and House Transportation Committee.

In the past, he has also served on the Legislative and Congressional Reapportionment Committee. Jackson has sponsored a significant number of bills during his tenure, demonstrating his active involvement in legislative matters.

Jackson's political positions have sometimes diverged from those of his party. For instance, he was the only Democrat in the House to vote for Georgia House Bill 481, which prevents physicians from performing abortions after six weeks with limited exceptions.
