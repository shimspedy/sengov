Representative Soo Hong is a native of Marietta and was elected to serve the citizens of House District 103 in November 2022. She has proudly served the people of Buford, Sugar Hill, unincorporated Gwinnett County and southern Hall County since being sworn into office on January 8, 2023.

In 2023, Rep. Hong was named a Floor Leader for Governor Brian Kemp and championed legislation that made life better for Georgia families and ensured every child across the state has the opportunity for a successful future. Rep. Hong worked with legislators on both sides of the aisle to combat rising gang violence and increase penalties for human traffickers to keep Georgia families and communities safe.

During her first term, Rep. Hong sponsored notable pieces of legislation that had strong bipartisan support. She sponsored HB 128, legislation that levels the playing field for women-, minority- and veteran-owned businesses, with overwhelming support from the legislature. She also sponsored HB 129, which extended aid to pregnant women in Georgia through the federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program.

Rep. Hong, the daughter of first-generation immigrants, was born in Seoul, South Korea and immigrated to the United States when she was just 10 years old. Her parents instilled in her the importance of hard work, determination and sacrifice â€“ all values that have helped her achieve the American dream.

As a child, Rep. Hong attended Powers Ferry Elementary School. Her community and teachers welcomed her with open arms and invested in her, oftentimes staying after school to help her learn English and shaping her into the woman she is today.

Rep. Hong graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology and worked numerous jobs to pay her way through college. After college, she attended Mercer University to get a law degree. She has been a practicing attorney for over a decade and owns her own law practice in Gwinnett and Cobb counties, where she helps struggling individuals and families in difficult situations.

Rep. Hong currently serves on the House Judiciary Committee and as chairman of the subcommittee for Judiciary Non-Civil Committee. She is also a member of the Judicial Nomination Commission. She is honored to serve the people of House District 103, and she looks forward to continue working in the General Assembly to preserve the American Dream for every Georgia family.
