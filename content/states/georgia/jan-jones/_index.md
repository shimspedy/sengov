First elected to office in 2003, Representative Jan Jones has distinguished herself as a passionate advocate for changing lives and increasing economic opportunities through improved public education and government closer to the people.

Jan was first elected Speaker Pro Tempore in 2010. She served in that position until she was elevated to Speaker of the House in November 2022. She will serve as Speaker until January 8, 2023. She was elected as the Republican nominee for Speaker Pro Tempore for the 2023-24 term. She proudly serves House District 47 in northwest Fulton, covering Milton, Mountain Park and portions of Roswell and Alpharetta. Her new district territory will also include a portion of eastern Cherokee County.

Born in Warner Robins, Speaker Jones has lived in Fulton County for 25 years. She graduated with a B.A. from the University of Georgia and an M.B.A. in Finance from Georgia State University. A former marketing manager for Home Box Office, she also owned a home-based small business while raising her children. She operated an energy consulting business with her husband from 2015-2019.

Jan is the granddaughter of two Laurens County farmers and the daughter of a career soldier. She and her husband, Kalin, have four children, and the family worships at Northpoint Community Church in Alpharetta.
