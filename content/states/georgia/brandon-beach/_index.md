In 2001, Governor Sonny Perdue appointed Sen. Beach to the board of Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA).

Sen. Beach was elected to the Board of the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) by state legislators from the 6th Congressional District in 2008 and served in this role until 2013. Senator Beach served as the Chairman of the Public Private Partnership Committee (P3 Committee). Under his leadership, the P3 Committee was able to acquire key local transportation projects approved for Cherokee and North Fulton.

Senator Beach is a member of the Fulton County Development Authority and serves as Vice-Chairman, a member of the Georgia World Congress Center Oversight Board, a member of the Georgia Lottery Corporation Oversight Board, a member of Alpharetta Rotary and a former member of the Board of Trustees at King’s Ridge Christian School.
