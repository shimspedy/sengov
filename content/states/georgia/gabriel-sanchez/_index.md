Gabriel Sanchez, born in 1997, is an American politician who was elected as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives for the 42nd district in 2024. He is a member of the Democratic Party and identifies as a democratic socialist. Sanchez's parents immigrated from Colombia to the United States in 1996, and he was born and raised in Georgia. He earned a film degree from Georgia State University in 2018.

Sanchez's political career began as a legislative aide to Sam Park and Park Cannon, both members of the Georgia House of Representatives. He also worked as an organizer for Atlanta's Stop Cop City movement. His campaign for the Georgia House of Representatives was endorsed by the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America.

Sanchez's political views are rooted in democratic socialism. He supports universal healthcare, housing for all, reproductive rights, a $20 minimum wage, paid leave for all workers, criminal justice reform, repealing Georgia's anti-union right-to-work law, protecting the Okefenokee Swamp, and state funding for public transit in Atlanta.

Sanchez's early life and education were shaped by his family's immigrant experience and the challenges they faced. His parents' journey from Colombia to the United States and their efforts to build a better life for their family inspired Sanchez to pursue a career in public service. He was drawn to advocacy and social justice from a young age, guided by a strong desire to stand up for his community.

Sanchez's political career has been marked by his commitment to progressive values and his dedication to uplifting community voices. He believes in the power of grassroots movements and the importance of diverse, progressive voices in state politics. His experience working in the Georgia State House taught him that dedicated progressives can have a real impact on policy and governance.

In addition to his political work, Sanchez is also a long-time community organizer and advocate for working people. He lives in Smyrna, Georgia, with his partner Anna, their dog Winston, and their cat Kiki. Sanchez's personal experiences and the lessons he learned from his family's struggles have shaped his political views and his commitment to fighting for a more just and equitable society.
