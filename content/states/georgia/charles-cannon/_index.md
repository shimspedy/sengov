Charles H. "Chas" Cannon, a member of the Republican Party, is a representative of the Georgia House of Representatives, representing District 172. He assumed office on February 6, 2023, and his current term ends on January 13, 2025.

Born and raised in Moultrie, Georgia, Chas is proudly carrying on the forestry and timber business started by his great-great-grandfather in 1912. He lives in a family home that spans four generations. Chas graduated from Schley County High School and was a three-sport athlete for the Colquitt County High School Packers in Moultrie, Georgia from 1993 to 1997.

He played football as a member of the Army Black Knights at West Point, where he earned his Bachelor’s Degree in June 2001 before joining the Field Artillery branch of the U.S. Army in Fort Sill, OK. He served in the U.S. Army from 2001 to 2014 and began working in the legislative affairs division of the U.S. Army Reserve in 2015.

Chas' military career was marked by significant events and deployments. Just three months after his arrival in Oklahoma as a brand new 2nd Lieutenant, the United States endured the worst terror attack in history on September 11, 2001. He was deployed to Iraq with the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division as part of the initial ground invasion by U.S. troops into Iraq, fighting in all major battles from southern Iraq into Baghdad. He was then deployed to Iraq once again for 12 months during the first Iraqi elections, stationed in Ramadi which was the center of the very violent insurgency. Finally, in 2007, Chas’ 3rd Brigade was once again called into action by President Bush, serving as part of the “surge” in 2007-2008. His final deployment lasted 15 months.

After returning from Iraq in 2008, Chas and his wife Beth moved to Washington, DC where Chas served as an Army Congressional Fellow. Here, he was granted top secret clearance as a liaison to Capitol Hill promoting the Army Budget within the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Committees. During their time in DC, Beth and Chas started their family, welcoming two daughters Catherine and Allie.

Chas then left active duty and joined the U.S. Army Reserves in 2014, returning to Moultrie to raise his family and be closer to the farm that he was continuing to manage from afar. Shortly after his return, he took on the role of County Administrator. As Chief Executive of the County, Chas has leveraged his Army leadership and management experience to reorganize and modernize county government operations with a focus on efficient, transparent and honest stewardship of local tax dollars.

Chas continues to run the day-to-day family farm operations, from long-range planning to performing manual labor, as well as managing timber and crop leases and equipment. He ran in a special election to the Georgia House of Representatives to represent District 172 and won in the special general election on January 31, 2023.
