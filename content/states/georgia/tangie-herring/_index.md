Born and raised in Macon, Georgia, Representative Tangie Herring is a 28-year classroom
teacher whose life is rooted in community service and a steadfast commitment to creating
opportunities for others. Her father, a career Airman, and her mother, a dedicated public-school
teacher, instilled in her the importance of living out her faith in service to others. Growing up in
the Bloomfield neighborhood, she was also profoundly influenced by her grandmother, a
trailblazer who broke barriers as one of the first Black women employed by the Keebler
company in Macon. These formative experiences shaped Rep. Herring's dedication to
perseverance, advocacy and service.
With more than two decades of experience as an educator in Georgia’s public schools, Rep.
Herring has shaped countless young minds while advocating for educational equity. She holds a
Bachelor’s degree from Georgia College, a Master’s degree from Mercer University and a
Specialist degree from Georgia State University. Her professional accomplishments are matched
by her commitment to community empowerment and revitalization, particularly in Macon-Bibb
and Monroe counties.
As a passionate advocate for our public schools and equitable opportunities, Rep. Herring is
dedicated to addressing the needs of her constituents. Her priorities include improving
educational resources, enhancing community safety, fostering economic development and
ensuring fiscal responsibility by keeping taxes low.
Rep. Herring is married to Wallace Herring of Macon and has one daughter, Zion, who is the
light of her life.
Guided by the values instilled by her family and anchored by her commitment to service, Rep.
Herring steps into her role as Georgia State Representative with a vision to unlock opportunities
for all Georgians. She is driven to ensure that every voice is heard and valued in the legislative
process and to help create a brighter future for the communities she is proud to represent.
