State Representative Rhonda Taylor represents the citizens of House District 91, which includes portions of DeKalb and Rockdale counties. She was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2020.

She began her political career while working in the beauty industry. As the owner of a salon, instructor, and product educator, advocacy brought her profession and her political volunteerism together. Her seasoned tenure in the beauty industry afforded her the opportunity of lobbying at the State Capitol when a Senate bill was introduced to deregulate licensing for Georgia’s cosmetology industry. She rallied the licensees and fought against the Senate bill’s passage, catapulting her deeper than volunteerism in the political arena.

Rep. Taylor’s political experience also includes that of media director, strategist, and campaign manager on both the local and state levels. She worked with the Obama Campaign (OFA-GA) in 2007 and 2012, where she managed both volunteerism and the “Get Out The Vote” initiative. She was elected to serve as a delegate for the 2012 Democratic National Convention representing the state of Georgia.

She is an active member of several professional organizations, including the Rockdale Chapter of the NAACP, National Women's History Project, Who’s Who among American Business Women, American Society of Travel Agents, and National Association for Female Executives. She is a former board member for Rockdale Works, as well as served on the Board of Directors for the League of Women Voters of Georgia. Rep. Taylor is a decades-long member of the National Council of Negro Women and the founder and immediate past president of the organization’s Rockdale-Newton Section.

Taylor holds a Bachelor of Arts in Pre-Law, Master of Business Administration with a concentration in global marketing/political strategy, and embraces an honorary doctorate degree. She owns Monarch Consulting, LLC, which provides legal support services for local boutique law firms.

She is the recipient of numerous awards, among them an “Excellence in Leadership” from former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes. She also received the “Outstanding Georgia Citizen’s Award” from former Secretary of State Zell Miller for her assistance in the passing Senate Bill 95 during the 2000 – 2001 legislative term; SB 95 brought significant changes and improvements for Georgia’s cosmetology industry. She received an additional “Outstanding Georgia Citizen’s Award” from former Secretary of State Cathy Cox for her support of women’s contributions to our state, as well as the Sisters With Vision Award from the A.M.E. Church – Missionary Society.

In addition to her political contributions, Rep. Taylor has been an active volunteer for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, Dress For Success Program, and chairs the annual Women’s History Month Symposium in Georgia. She is the creator and facilitator of “Manners Please,” a personal development and etiquette course for young girls.

Rep. Taylor loves speaking and teaching on grace, beauty, and African American women’s history. She lives in Conyers and is a faithful member in leadership at Antioch A.M.E. Church, where she chairs the annual Women’s History Month initiatives. She also serves as the president of the church’s Social Action Ministry and the Atlanta East District A.M.E. Church Social Action Ministries, which is 26 churches strong. Her passion is in inspiring and serving others.
