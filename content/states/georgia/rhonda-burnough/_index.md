State Representative Rhonda Burnough was first elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2016, representing the citizens of House District 77, which includes portions of Clayton County.

Before her election to the Georgia General Assembly, Representative Burnough was a dedicated public school administrator. She created and implemented several programs to enrich the quality of education for students in the state. These include the DAY ONE initiative, which promotes the importance of starting the academic year with a positive attitude and eagerness to learn, and the Celebrity Reader program, where community leaders read to students.

Rhonda is also the founder of several community organizations, including 500 Men Standing in the GAP and 500 Women Standing in the GAP. These volunteer programs encourage fathers, men, and women to become actively involved in the lives of their children and others in the community.

Her commitment to improving the lives of those in Clayton County has led her to serve on several local boards of directors. Her philanthropic work has been recognized with several service-based awards, including the 2013 National Community and Service Award and the 2012 Gold Volunteer Service Award, both from President Barack Obama.
