Rick grew up in Kingsport, Tennessee. After graduating from The University of Georgia’s College of Agriculture with a degree in Food Science, Rick started work as the Assistant County Agent in Bartow County in 1980. He then moved to Bleckley County in South Georgia to further his experience in agriculture. Since 1983, Pickens County has been his home. Rick and his wife, Marcia Rowlett, live on a small farm.

Rick has been very active in the community over the years. He has served on various boards and clubs, including the Mountain Conservation Trust Board, Chattahoochee Technical College Board, and Appalachian Cattlemen’s Association. He was a long-time member of the Jasper Lion’s Club and is now a member of the Jasper Rotary Club. He was President and game announcer of the Pickens High School Tip-Off Club. He has cooked pork and chicken BBQ for many organizations and events to raise money for charity. He coached little league baseball for years. Rick and his family had a small landscaping business for a number of years.

Rick’s relationship with God has always been an important part of his life. Christian principles are an important part of his everyday approach to life and to making decisions. It is the basis of his enthusiasm to display a servant-leadership approach to public office just like he has in work, family, and in community activities.

Rick retired in 2009 after 29 years as a County Agent. Budget reductions at the University put a few of the older employees out to pasture. As an educator with the University of Georgia College of Agriculture and Pickens County, his role was to teach, inform, and empower folks.

Rick entered a new world of service in 2010 when he was elected to be the State Representative for what is now the 11th District, which is part of Gordon County, part of Murray County, and all of Pickens.

Rick currently serves as the Chairman of the Education Committee, Secretary of Rules, and as a member on the following House Committees: Agricultural and Consumer Affairs, Appropriations, Health & Human Services, Higher Education, Human Relations & Aging, Public Safety & Homeland Security, and Regulated Industries.
