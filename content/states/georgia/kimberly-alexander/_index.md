Kimberly Alexander is a native of Paulding County, Georgia. She grew up in Hiram, Georgia, and attended Paulding County Schools. She now lives in neighboring Douglas County.

Rep. Alexander is the eighth of 11 children. She holds a master's degree in administration from Central Michigan University and a bachelor's degree from Morris Brown College. She is also certified as a business manager and risk management assurance professional.

Rep. Alexander was elected in the 2012 General Election for the newly-created House District 66 seat, which consists of parts of Douglas and Paulding counties. Rep. Alexander first made history in Paulding County as being the first African-American female to run for office on the Hiram City Council. Her election to the House is historic as she is the first female Douglas County resident elected to the State House and first African-American female elected in Paulding County.

In January of 2015, Rep. Alexander was appointed as the deputy minority whip in the Georgia House of Representatives. She also serves as the parliamentarian for the bi-partisan House Women’s Caucus. She is also a member of the Banks & Banking, Code Revision, Intragovernmental Coordination, Legislative & Congressional Reapportionment and Motor Vehicles committees.

In the House, Rep. Alexander has sponsored the Tax Accountability Act, the Child Safety & Emergency Preparedness Act and a local elections bill that was signed into law by the Governor. If enacted, the Child Safety & Emergency Preparedness Act verbiage would have appeared in the State’s Regulatory Report by the end of the year to enhance disaster plans at child care facilities across the State.

Rep. Alexander has spent over 16 years as a community advocate. Her most memorable work was serving as the key coordinator for local efforts to protect teens from draconian statutory rape and child molestation laws that unfairly punished them for having consensual contact with their peers.

In addition, Rep. Alexander has received numerous awards for her community outreach, including the 2015 Award of Excellence for Service, Commitment, Inspiration and Dedication. She has also served as a panelist for the “2015 State of Education Forum - Legislation & It’s Impact on the Education System of Georgia,” as well as the 2015 graduation speaker for the Atlanta Job Corps. Rep. Alexander was also selected to participate in the 2015 Emerging Leaders Program for the State Legislative Leaders Foundation at the University of Virginia. Up to 50 state legislators from across the country are selected to participate in this program every year, and she is the only participant from Georgia. Rep. Alexander received the 2013 CAPO - Community and Political Organizer Award/Woman of the Year in Douglas County.

Rep. Alexander’s tireless dedication to her community has been featured on CNN, BET, MTV, ABC and NBC, as well as international news channels in Europe.

Rep. Alexander has a diverse business background and has worked as a part-time college instructor. Her professional work experience is in the insurance, banking, finance and international business industries as an internal auditor.

When she is not participating in the legislative session at the Georgia General Assembly, Rep. Alexander works as an auditor contractor. She is a proud long-time member of the Institute of Internal Auditors and a past member of the National Association of Black Accountants.

Rep. Alexander and her son, Ferrow, enjoy spending time together with family and friends. In her spare time, Rep. Alexander enjoys traveling, meeting people and relaxing.
