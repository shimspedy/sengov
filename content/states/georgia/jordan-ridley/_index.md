Jordan Ridley is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He represents the 22nd district of the Georgia House of Representatives. Ridley's political journey began with his family, who were politically involved and instilled in him the importance of community engagement. From a young age, he was exposed to some of the brightest political minds, such as Bob Barr and Tom Price.

In May 2022, Ridley ran for election to the Georgia House of Representatives to represent District 22. He faced Donna Kosicki in the Republican primary election and emerged victorious. His win in the primary paved the way for his participation in the general election.

In the general election held in November 2022, Ridley faced off against Stacee Lashone Hill. Ridley won the election with 61 percent of the votes, demonstrating the trust and confidence that the people of District 22 had in him. He succeeded Wes Cantrell and assumed office in 2023.

As a member of the Georgia House of Representatives, Ridley has been actively involved in various committees. He has served on the Code Revision Committee, the Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications Committee, and the Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee.

Ridley's tenure in the Georgia House of Representatives has been marked by his commitment to his constituents and his dedication to public service. His current term ends on January 13, 2025, and he continues to work tirelessly to represent the people of District 22.
