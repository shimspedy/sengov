State Representative Clint Crowe represents the citizens of House District 118, which includes Butts County, as well as portions of Henry, Jasper and Putnam counties. He was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2020.

Rep. Crowe is a second-generation realtor, and he has worked in the real estate industry for more than 20 years. Prior to running a real estate business, Rep. Crowe had a decade-long career in law enforcement as a patrolman/field training officer and detective with a metro Atlanta police department.

In 2003, Rep. Crowe joined his parents at a local independent real estate company in the Jackson, Georgia area and began selling homes on Jackson Lake, where his family had owned property since 1958. In 2006, Rep. Crowe was brought on as managing broker in a local RE/MAX office, where his parents later joined him. As the real estate market began a downturn during the recession, the company decided to close the Jackson office. As such, Clint and his family ventured out to start their own company.

Together, Rep. Crowe and his family opened Crowe Realty, where Rep. Crowe served as the qualifying broker for the company. With his parents retiring in 2014, Rep. Crowe continued to grow the company and in August of 2020 affiliated with Century 21 as a franchise. The company currently has three offices in Locust Grove, Jackson and Macon with approximately 100 agents.

Rep. Crowe has a Bachelor of Business Administration and a Master of Business Administration from the Mercer University Stetson School of Business and Economics.

He and his wife, Kristie, live at Jackson Lake and have four kids, a daughter-in-law, and a grandson and a granddaughter.

Rep. Crowe currently serves as Vice Chairman of the House Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security and the House Ways and Means Committee. He also serves as Secretary of the House Judiciary Non-Civil Committee and a member of the House Committees on Banks and Banking, State Planning and Community Affairs, Technology and Infrastructure Innovation and as Ex-Officio of the House Appropriations Committee.
