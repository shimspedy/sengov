Senator Nabilah Islam, the daughter of working-class immigrants from Bangladesh, brings her upbringing of grit and empathy to the Georgia State Senate. She made history with her 2022 election, becoming the youngest woman and first Muslim woman ever elected to the Georgia state Senate. Sen. Islam represents Georgia State Senate District 7, which encompasses parts of Gwinnett County, the 4th most diverse county in America.

Sen. Islam serves on the Government Oversight Committee, the Veterans, Military and Homeland Security Committee, the State Institutions and Properties Committee, and the Science and Technology Committee. She is also the Vice-Chair of the Gwinnett Senate legislative delegation.

She is a member of Georgiaâ€™s first-ever Asian American and Pacific Islander Caucus and Hispanic Caucus, as well as the Georgia Black Caucus and Working Families Caucus.

Sen. Islam graduated from Central Gwinnett High School and earned her business degree from Georgia State University. Prior to running for office, she dedicated her life and career to advancing progressive ideals in Georgia through civic engagement at the local, state, and national levels. Her personal experiences have taught her how to strategically work on issues and have given her valuable lessons on how to work through bipartisan efforts to get things done for the people of Georgia.
