State Representative Victor Anderson is a life-long resident of House District 10, which includes portions of Habersham and White counties. He is a small business owner, proud conservative and avid sportsman. He was elected to serve in the Georgia House of Representatives in 2020.

After graduating from Habersham Central High School, Rep. Anderson received a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering with Honors from Georgia Tech. He worked for the Georgia Power Company in various areas, including power generation, industrial, commercial and power marketing for 10 years. He left Georgia Power as a key account executive in order to pursue growing his family businesses.

Currently, Rep. Anderson is the second-generation co-owner of Anderson Carpet One Floor & Home. He is also a partner in two small startups, Better Body Fitness 24/7, LLC and Mountain View Motorsports, LLC.

Victor has served as a deacon at B.C. Grant Baptist Church, as well as a member of several volunteer boards of directors, including Habersham Christian Learning Center, Avita Community Partners and First Georgia Bank Community Board. He has served on the Habersham County Planning Commission and was elected as the county’s District 3 county commissioner in 2014. He served one term, which is four years, as commissioner and two years as the commission chair. Most recently, Rep. Anderson served as a board member and chair of the Hospital Authority of Habersham County.

Victor is blessed to be married to his high school sweetheart, Kim. Together, they have two beautiful daughters, Lauren and Amberly. The joy of his life is being “Papa” to his grandson, Kendrick.
