State Representative Mesha Mainor was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2020, representing the citizens of House District 56 in the heart of Atlanta. In 2023, she made history by becoming the first African American woman to serve in the Georgia General Assembly as a Republican.

Rep. Mainor is an Atlanta native and sixth-generation Georgian with ancestral roots dating back to the 1820s. She is currently working on her doctorate in business administration from Northcentral University, focusing on corporate prosocial behaviors, succession planning, crisis preparedness, leadership, cross-generational communication, and disruptive solutions that add value to stakeholders.

Her professional experience includes a Master's in Physical Therapy from Howard University. She has worked with Congressman John Lewis and the U.S. Agency for International Development Office of Global Health in Washington, D.C., and was hand-selected to work with former U.S. Assistant Surgeon General, Dr. Helene Gayle at CDC. Today, her first boss and mentor, Dr. Gayle, is now her constituent as the new president of Spelman College.

During her first legislative session, Rep. Mainor authored bipartisan legislation to create the Fulton Technology and Energy Authority, the first public agency in the nation to focus on the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) workforce. This historic legislation positions Fulton County as a leader in technology and renewable energy career readiness, while also improving the state’s energy infrastructure.

Before serving in public office, Rep. Mainor founded an immersion language school to teach children how to be global citizens. She received an award from Governor Nathan Deal in her first year of operation for providing exceptional childcare services. Rep. Mainor also trademarked the Junior Business League, a program teaching children to think outside the box through entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and civic engagement.

Rep. Mainor is a proud mother of Alexis and Chloe, students of the Atlanta Public School System. As an APS graduate herself, she is nationally known as a parent rights loyalist committed to ensuring children have the resources to succeed. Her life's journey is attributed to following God’s plan while being led by the Holy Spirit.
