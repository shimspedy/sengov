Jaclyn Ford is a dedicated American politician who serves as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives, representing the 170th district. She assumed office on January 13, 2025, succeeding Penny Houston. Born and raised in Berrien County, Georgia, Jaclyn has deep roots in the rural community she now represents. She and her husband, Jake, have raised their family in the same area, instilling in them the values and traditions of rural Georgia.

Jaclyn's district, House District 170, is a vital part of South Georgia's agricultural region. It spans from the southern tip of Berrien County to half of Cook County and encompasses most of Tift County. Agriculture is not just an economic driver in this region; it is the backbone of the communities. The residents of this district, whether directly employed on farms or in businesses tied to agriculture, recognize the importance of this industry. Jaclyn is proud to advocate for her district and champion Georgia's number one industry in Atlanta.

In addition to her legislative duties, Jaclyn is actively involved in various local and state organizations. She serves on the State Farm Service Agency State Committee, the Georgia Farm Bureau Cotton Committee, and the Georgia Agribusiness Council Board of Directors. Her involvement extends to the Economic Development State Board, the ABAC Foundation Bank Board, the SGMC-Berrien Hospital Board, and the Berrien Touchdown Club. Jaclyn's commitment to her community is evident in her participation in these organizations, which help inform her decisions for her district.

Jaclyn's key issues include economic development, education, agriculture and natural resources, taxes, safe communities, and rural prosperity. She is dedicated to strengthening and supporting House District 170 and ensuring that the voices of her constituents are heard in the state legislature. Her passion for her community and her dedication to public service make her a respected and influential figure in Georgia politics.
