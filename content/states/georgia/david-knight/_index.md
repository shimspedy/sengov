State Representative David grew up in Griffin, Georgia and graduated from Woodward Academy. He attended the University of Georgia and Augusta College where he completed his CPA internship and earned his Bachelor’s Degree. After graduation, he moved to Albany and then to Atlanta for work before returning to Griffin to practice accounting in 1999. He has since launched a consulting firm to help develop policy strategies for effective influence, communication, and implementation of public policy.

Since first being elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2005, David’s priority has been to safeguard conservative values and write comprehensive, logical policies that align with the cornerstones of his home district and the State. He has worked on and passed comprehensive legislation in the areas of healthcare, tax, education, and conservation.

David is the Chairman of the House Higher Education Appropriations subcommittee and also serves as a committee member on the Rules, Ways and Means, Special Committee on Access to Quality Health Care, Game Fish and Parks, Higher Education, Banks and Banking, and Small Business Development committees. He is also the Chairman of the House Sportsman’s Caucus.

He met and married his wife Marie in Griffin in 2005, and together they have one son, John David. David has a passion for the outdoors, and he makes sure he finds time for coaching baseball, hunting, fishing, and passing down those traditions and hobbies to his son.
