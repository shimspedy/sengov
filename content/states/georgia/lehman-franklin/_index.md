He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2022 and currently serves as Vice Chairman of the Retirement Committee.

Rep. Franklin is a native of Statesboro, Georgia where he graduated from Statesboro High School. He obtained a B.S. in Business Administration from the Citadel Military College in 1997 and received a Master of Business Administration from Georgia Southern University in 2002. During his time at Georgia Southern University, he worked in hospitality managing a full-time motel business in Savannah, Georgia.

After graduating, he sailed to Central America living on his small sailboat visiting numerous countries and cultures along the way. In 2003, he was called to work as a missionary in Argentina for four years. Later, he helped establish Marine Reach Ministries and served four years as the Marine Captain and Ministry Director of a crew of 30 on a 140-foot sailboat.
