Floyd L. Griffin Jr. is an American politician and retired United States Army Colonel. Born on May 24, 1944, in Milledgeville, Georgia, Griffin has had a distinguished career in both military and public service. He earned an Associate of Science degree in funeral service from Gupton-Jones College, a Bachelor of Science degree in building construction from the Tuskegee Institute, and a master's degree in contract procurement and management from the Florida Institute of Technology. Additionally, he graduated from the Army Command and General Staff College and the National War College.

Griffin's military career began in 1967 when he served as a helicopter pilot and flight instructor during the Vietnam War. He also served a tour of duty in Germany, where he held various positions, including logistics officer, battalion chief, and director of engineering and housing. From 1984 to 1986, Griffin commanded an engineering battalion at Fort Stewart, Georgia, and from 1986 to 1990, he was assigned to the Pentagon. He retired from the military in 1990 with the rank of Colonel.

After retiring from the Army, Griffin transitioned to a career in politics and public service. In 1994, he ran for the Georgia State Senate representing the 25th district and won, becoming the first African American to win a majority Caucasian district in the Georgia State Senate since the end of the Reconstruction era. He was re-elected in 1996 but sacrificed his Senate seat in 1998 to run for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia. Although he did not win the lieutenant governor race, Griffin remained active in politics.

In 2001, Griffin was elected Mayor of Milledgeville, Georgia, and served until 2005. During his tenure as mayor, he focused on improving the city's infrastructure and public services. After his term as mayor, Griffin continued to be involved in politics and public service. He ran for the Georgia State Senate again in 2010 but was unsuccessful. In 2015, he ran for mayor of Milledgeville once more but lost by a narrow margin.

Griffin's dedication to public service did not wane. In 2024, he ran for the Georgia House of Representatives representing the 149th district and won. He assumed office on January 13, 2025. Throughout his career, Griffin has been committed to serving his community and advocating for policies that promote social justice, economic development, and veterans' rights.

In addition to his political career, Griffin is also an accomplished businessman. He took over the family business, Slater's Funeral Home, and has served as its vice president. Griffin has also been involved in education, teaching military science at Wake Forest University and Winston-Salem State University, where he also coached the offensive backfield for the Winston-Salem State Rams college football team.

Griffin's life and career are a testament to his dedication to public service, his commitment to his community, and his unwavering determination to make a positive impact. His autobiography, "Legacy to Legend: Winners Make it Happen," published in 2009, chronicles his journey and achievements, offering inspiration to those who aspire to make a difference in their own communities.
