State Representative Demetrius Douglas grew up on the Southside of Atlanta and attended Lakeshore High School in College Park, where he received All-American honors for his performance in football and basketball. After high school, he attended the University of Georgia (UGA), where he played as a Defensive Linebacker under the legendary coach Vince Dooley and again received All-American honors in football. He graduated from UGA with a Bachelor of Science in Education and a minor in marketing.

Following his graduation, Demetrius played professional football for the New York Jets, Washington Redskins, and the Calgary Stampeders. He was recently inducted into the UGA Football Hall of Fame.

After retiring from professional football, Demetrius entered the finance profession as a mortgage broker and later transitioned into the real estate profession. He excelled in the mortgage industry for 15 years, spending the last five years as a successful entrepreneur. In addition to his work as a real estate investor, Demetrius has a passion for youth and has coached football at Arlington Christian School, Henry W. Grady High School, Lovejoy High School, and is currently coaching defense at Dutchtown High School.

Heavily involved in his community, Demetrius enjoys motivating youth to be the best they can be. As a servant-leader, he is an active member of Word of Faith Family Worship Cathedral, where he serves as a deacon.

Demetrius was first elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in July 2012. He represents the citizens of House District 78, which includes parts of Clayton and Henry counties, specifically, the Jonesboro, Lake Spivey, Lovejoy, and Stockbridge areas.

Demetrius believes his proudest achievement is the establishment of his family. He and his wife, Veda, have been married since 1998. They reside in Henry County with their two daughters, Destiny and Demi.
