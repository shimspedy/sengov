State Representative Lynn Gladney lives in Augusta, Georgia and when she is not participating in the Georgia General Assembly, she works as the Director of Motor Vehicle Registration. She heads the division that is responsible for serving the 206K(+) residents of Richmond County by ensuring that drivers are compliant pursuant to the constitutional authority of the Tax Commissioner and the guidelines of the Georgia Department of Revenue (DOR). During her tenure in her current role, she has led her division through the successful implementation of the DOR’s statewide technology upgrade in 2018, which included 159 counties and was the most significant investment in the state department history.

Rep. Gladney has professional experiences that have allowed her to travel all over the world. She was born on the West Coast in Vallejo, California but she spent the early years of her childhood in Jonesboro, Arkansas where she later graduated from high school and joined the U.S. Army. Her career began at Fort Stewart, in Hinesville, Georgia, with a generational family legacy of military service. As the granddaughter of a WW2 era Navy Veteran and the daughter of a Vietnam era Army Veteran, Rep. Gladney is a proud decorated Army Veteran, and the first woman in her family to serve in the United States Armed Forces.

Rep. Gladney was elected in the 2022 General Election for the newly-drawn House District 130 seat, which is situated in Richmond County and includes parts of Local Commission District’s 1, 2, 5, 6 & 8. Rep Gladney has made history as the first African-American Woman Veteran to hold a state level seat in her region.

Her background reflects 35 years of experience that encompass small business, public and private sector organizations, military and local municipal government in the following areas: public education, public relations, professional development, team building, problem solving, strategic implementation, budgeting, organizational collaboration, policy interpretation and leadership. She holds a Bachelor’s of Science in Business Management from the University of Phoenix. She is a graduate of Leadership Augusta and the Georgia Economic Leadership Academy.

Rep. Gladney has received numerous awards for her community outreach, including the Women of Wealth (WOW) Empowering Women Magazine’s Innovative Leadership Award for 2021.

Rep. Gladney’s philosophy of leadership is anchored in her faith and her commitment to advocate for others. She has spent many years serving as an involved member of the Augusta community with the following formal boards & local organizational affiliations to her credit:
- Commissioner & Opportunity Zone/Ad Hoc Subcommittee, Chair (2020 -2022) Augusta Aviation Commission for the Augusta Regional Airport
Augusta Regional Airport (AGS) strives to build and maintain partnerships throughout the Augusta community. It is believed that due to the strong presence the airport holds in the community, bringing visibility to area organizations and highlighting events will increase tourism and inspire growth opportunities for our region.

Rep. Gladney is the founder of Beyond the Call of Duty, Inc., a nonprofit foundation based in Augusta, GA, which she started in 2020. The idea of Beyond the Call of Duty was created out of a need for veterans, seniors, and their families to have a better working knowledge of the 300 (+) resources & services offered in their area. Service providers in the Augusta area do an incredible job supporting each other, but due to budgetary limitations, they do not have the latitude to advocate for one another. The aim is to create a technological solution via a universal shared platform of information that would give better visibility to the resources and service providers already doing the work in their immediate area.
