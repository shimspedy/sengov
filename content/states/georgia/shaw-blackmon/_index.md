Shaw Blackmon was raised in Houston County along with his brother Brad and sister Kayce. After graduating from Warner Robins High School, Blackmon attended the University of Georgia where he completed his degree in Management Information Systems. Upon moving back to Houston County, Shaw began working in sales for National Bank Products, a small family business founded by the Blackmon family. After 10 years in sales, Shaw moved into management and operations, prior to becoming President and CEO.

Shaw’s commitment to community has been longstanding, as he is passionate in making our region of the state the best place to work, live and raise a family. He has served on the board of the Houston County Development Authority, and been an active member of the Perry Area and Robins Regional Chambers, serving as board Chairman for the Robins Chamber in 2012. In these roles, he has worked to promote new industry, facilitate expansion, and provide mediums from which businesses can broaden their customer base.

Blackmon also volunteers his time serving foundations dedicated to strengthening Georgia’s educational systems. Central Georgia Technical College and the Houston County Heritage Foundation, benefiting K-12 public education, have allowed Shaw to work on behalf of our educational community, ensuring students are well prepared to service our region’s economic development and growth. As a member of the Technical College System of Georgia State Board, he has worked to provide our state with a more seamless approach to education by improving transferability between the technical colleges and the University system, as well as, enhancing dual-enrollment opportunities with the Department of Education.

Through continued outreach, Shaw continues to be heavily involved in the effort to bring investment back to Houston County. This includes funding for the Veteran’s Training Center and the Health Science facility on the primary campus of Central Georgia Technical College.

Shaw was elected to the 146th District in 2015 and serves on Economic Development & Tourism, Governmental Affairs, Insurance, Juvenile Justice, Rules, Small Business Development, Special Rules, and Ways & Means Committees. He serves as Chair of the Transportation Committee on Appropriations and also as House Appointee to the Joint Defense Commission. Shaw resides in Warner Robins with his wife, Whitney, son Cort, and stepson, Ges. They are members of Central Baptist Church in Warner Robins.

Shaw will continue to focus on the issues near to his heart and his background – strengthening our defense community, enhancing education, and getting government out of the way of small businesses so that Houston County can continue to grow and thrive for future generations.
