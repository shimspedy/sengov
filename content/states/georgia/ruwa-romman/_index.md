Ruwa Romman, born around 1993, is a Palestinian–American politician who made history in 2022 by becoming the first Muslim woman to be elected to the Georgia State House of Representatives.

Romman was born in Jordan and moved to the United States when she was just 7 years old. She pursued her education in the United States, attending Oglethorpe University and Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. She graduated from McCourt with a Master's degree in Public Policy in 2019.

After graduation, she worked for Deloitte as a senior consultant. Romman has been involved in local politics and civic engagement groups since 2014. In 2020, Romman co-founded the Georgia Volunteer Hub, which trained thousands of volunteers to support the Georgia Senate Runoff election.

In January 2022, she announced her candidacy to become the Georgia House of Representative for District 97. On May 24, 2022, Romman won the Democratic primary against Democrat JT Wu for Georgia House District 97. On November 8, 2022, Romman won the general election for Georgia House District 97 against Republican John Chan, making her the first Muslim woman to be elected into the Georgia State House of Representatives.

During her 2022 campaign, Romman was endorsed by NARAL, Fair Fight, the Georgia Working Families Party, and the Asian-American Advocacy Fund. Romman campaigned on expanding health care access, protecting voting rights, supporting access to abortion and helping working families.

Since November 2022, Romman is part of Georgia's first formal "Legislative Asian American Pacific Islander Caucus." She continues to serve the people of Georgia with dedication and commitment.
