Deborah Silcox is an attorney, a mother, and a community activist. She grew up in Sandy Springs and graduated from Riverwood High School. She earned her Bachelor of Arts from the University of Georgia and her law degree from Emory University School of Law. Deborah practiced law for 10 years and gave up partnership to raise her family. During this time, she served on the boards of the Junior League of Atlanta, Atlanta Speech School, Hands on Georgia, and the Chastain Park Conservancy. Governor Sonny Perdue appointed her to serve on the Department of Human Resources Board and the Governor's Commission for Volunteerism and Service; Deborah was then selected by Governor Nathan Deal to serve as the chairman of this state commission.

The people of House District 52 previously elected Deborah as their state representative, where she served from 2016-2020. In 2017, the Georgia Ophthalmology Society named Deborah as the “Legislator of the Year.” She also earned a Health Policy Certificate from the Georgia State Health Policy Center in 2017. For her work in the 2018 legislative session, the Georgia Municipal Association named Deborah as a “Champion of Georgia’s Cities,” and she received the Medical Association of Georgia’s “1849 Friend of Medicine Award” for her legislative work on behalf of physicians and their patients. In September 2019, Deborah travelled to Japan to represent Georgia on an economic development trip as a guest of the Japanese government. Later in 2019, the late Speaker David Ralston appointed Deborah as the chairman of the House MARTOC Committee, which oversees MARTA, and she was also named a deputy whip for the House Republican Caucus. In January 2020, Rep. Silcox was recognized by Engineering Georgia Magazine as one of the “Top 100 Most Influential Women in Georgia” and was also chosen as a "Lawyer of Distinction." During this time, she served on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Education and the Judiciary, Health and Human Services, Non-Civil Judiciary, Code Revision and State Planning and Community Affairs committees.

Following the 2020 census, Deborah was reelected to the Georgia House in 2022 to represent House District 53. She is the only Republican state representative inside of the I-285 perimeter. She was renamed by Speaker Jon Burns as the chairman of MARTOC and as vice chairman of the House Non-Civil Judiciary Committee. She also currently serves on the House Judiciary, Public Health, and Urban Affairs committees.

Deborah currently serves on the Board of Trustees for the University of Georgia’s Richard B. Russell Library, the Georgia Commission on the Holocaust, the Chastain Park Conservancy Advisory Council, and the Sandy Springs Conservancy Advisory Council. She is also an active member of the Sandy Springs Society.

For more than 30 years, Deborah has been married to Dr. Hal Silcox III. She and her husband are members of Peachtree Presbyterian Church. Deborah and Hal have two grown children, Elizabeth and Hal IV.
