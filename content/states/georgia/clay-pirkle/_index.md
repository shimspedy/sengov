Later, while working on his MBA in Accounting and Finance at the University of Georgia in Athens, he worked as a teaching assistant in the economics department and in the soybean lab.

Currently, Rep. Pirkle works as a farmer at Pirkle Farms, whose motto is “Christianity is our business; we farm to pay the expenses.” He has also held positions as an economist with the US government, a commercial banker at a local bank, and an economics instructor at Darton College.
