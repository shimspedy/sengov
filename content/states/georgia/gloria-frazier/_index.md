State Representative Gloria Frazier was born and raised in Greenwood, a small town outside of Shreveport, Louisiana. She graduated from Bethune Jr./Sr. High School in 1973 and then moved to Dallas, Texas, where she attended El Centro Junior College and worked for Texas Instruments Corporation. She later married Sgt. Wayne Frazier of the U.S. Army. They have two daughters, Alicia Frazier of Gainesville, Florida, and LeKendrea Frazier of Augusta, Georgia, and two grandsons, Khyree and Averii.

Rep. Frazier has spent 23 years as a military wife supporting her husband in the U.S. Army and raising their two daughters. They were stationed in several locations, including Ft. Hood, Texas; Presidio-Monterey, California; Ft. Dix, New Jersey; Hanau, West Germany; Nurnberg, West Germany; and Frankfurt, West Germany. She has also traveled to Switzerland, Amsterdam, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Paris, France and throughout the U.S. She attended the University of Maryland’s Business Administration program overseas campus for two years. She has extensive training in budgeting and finance from the U.S. military and worked 10 years in civil service for the U.S. government. She is a graduate of Military Real Estate School in Augusta, Georgia.

Rep. Gloria Frazier was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives on January 8, 2007, and currently serves her seventh term. She represents over 52,000 constituents in Augusta and Burke counties. In addition to her legislative duties, she also serves on numerous committees, including Banks & Banking, Budget and Fiscal Affairs Oversight, Public Safety and Homeland Security, and Energy, Utilities & Telecommunications. She is also treasurer of the Georgia Women’s Legislative Caucus and a member of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus. Her service extends beyond the realms of legislator as seen in her involvement with community-based organizations. She is a former president of the Richmond County Neighborhood Associations Alliance, Inc., which was comprised of 32 state incorporated associations working together to keep communities safe and drug-free. Rep. Frazier also previously served as president of the Walton Farms Neighborhood Association in South Augusta.

She has received the highest individual achievement award presented for community service by the Richmond County Neighborhood Association Alliance.

In August of 2014, Representative Frazier retired from the Richmond County Board of Education Title 1 Office, where she proudly served in administration, finance and accounting. Her commitment and dedication to her constituency and willingness to serve has made Richmond & Burke counties better places to live. As an advocate for education, affordable healthcare and mental health and developmental disabilities awareness, Rep. Frazier has become a powerful voice in Augusta and throughout Georgia. Rep. Gloria Frazier is an authentic leader who works faithfully and cares for all Georgians.
