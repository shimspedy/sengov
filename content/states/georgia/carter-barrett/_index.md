Carter Barrett, also known as J. Carter Barrett, is an American Republican politician from Georgia. He is currently representing the 24th district in the Georgia House of Representatives.

Born on June 27, Barrett attended high school in Rome, Italy, and graduated from the University of Georgia with a BBA in finance. Originally from Augusta, Barrett moved to Cumming in Georgia in 1990 and started working as a banker for Wachovia.

In 2008, he co-founded Forsyth-based Community Business Bank, which was later sold to Community and Southern Bank in 2015. He then worked for Affinity Bank. Barrett is also on the board of directors for the Forsyth County Chamber.

In terms of his political career, Barrett defeated incumbent Sheri Gilligan in the primary following a runoff in 2022. Gilligan had previously opposed aspects of then-Speaker David Ralston's mental health bill, and Ralston's campaign committee supported Barrett, helping him to raise over $280,000. He went on to defeat Democratic challenger Sydney Walker in November 2022.

In an interview in 2022, Barrett said the 24th House district is "the only political office I ever intend to run for." The Coalition of Advocates for Georgia's Elderly honored Barrett as 2023 Outstanding Legislator of the Year.

Barrett lives in Cumming, Georgia with his wife Jamie; they were married in 1995 and have two daughters.
