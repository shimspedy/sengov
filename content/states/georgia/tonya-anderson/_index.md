Senator Tonya P. Anderson, described as enthusiastic, strong, motivated, and visionary, was elected to represent Georgia’s 43rd District in the State Senate in 2016. Sen. Anderson's district includes parts of DeKalb, Rockdale, and Newton counties. Prior to serving as State Senator, she served as the 1st State Representative for House District 92 and as City Councilwoman and Mayor for the City of Lithonia.

In the Senate, she serves on several committees including Reapportionment & Redistricting; Economic Development & Tourism; Regulated Industries; the Veterans, Military, and Homeland Security Committee; Banking & Financial Institutions; and MARTOC-public transit oversight committee. Sen. Anderson is Chair Emeritus of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus (GLBC). Recently, she was elected by her peers to serve as the President for the National Organization of Black Elected Legislative Women (NOBEL Women), with her term beginning on January 1, 2024.

Sen. Anderson retired in 2012 from the United States Air Force Reserve after more than 21 honorable years of service and continues to volunteer and advocate for veterans’ services, services for seniors, and youth. Sen. Anderson earned a degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Management from THE Alabama State University, a Masters of Divinity from Luther Rice University, and an MBA from Georgia State University. She has two Honorary Doctorate degrees in Humanitarian & Theology, respectively. Most recently, she completed YALE University’s Women Leadership Academy.

Sen. Anderson is the recipient of numerous awards over the years by many world-renowned organizations, including the National DAV (Disabled American Veteran), Women Veteran’s Social Justice award; the Woman of Excellence Award by The National Foundation of Women Legislators (NFWL); The Who’s Who in Black Atlanta Award; and The DeKalb County NAACP Medgar Evers Freedom Legacy Award.

Sen. Anderson is the author and champion of a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill—Senate Bill 288. This bill allows for the restriction and sealing of criminal records of most misdemeanor and some felony convictions. Prior to the passage of SB288, in GA, any criminal record stayed on a person’s record for life. This bill affects 4.3 million Georgians and will create opportunities for employment, housing, and school (to pursue a higher education). SB288 went into effect on January 1, 2021. Simultaneously, Sen. Anderson co-sponsored another bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform bill, SB105, which shortens felony probation time. Additionally, Sen. Anderson is the author of another criminal justice reform measure – SB 257 which expands the reach to restrict and seal criminal records.

Sen. Anderson is an ordained minister, a life coach, consultant, motivational speaker, mentor, and a proud, active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated.
