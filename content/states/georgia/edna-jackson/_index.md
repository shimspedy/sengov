Jackson was born in Savannah, Georgia, to parents Georgia Branch Dillard and Henry Reid. She began her community service involvement at nine years old, after meeting Wesley Wallace Law.

She graduated High School in 1962 from Alfred E. Beach High School. Jackson continued her involvement with the NAACP Youth Council during her college education. She graduated from Savannah State University, with a B.S. in Sociology in 1968, and a M.Ed. in Political Science Education in 1972.

Beginning her career as a social worker, Jackson joined the Economic Opportunity Authority for Savannah-Chatham County Area. From 1971 through 2001, Edna Jackson worked for her alma mater, Savannah State University.
