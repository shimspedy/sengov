State Representative Angela Moore represents the citizens of House District 90, which includes portions of DeKalb, Rockdale, and Henry counties. She was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2021.

Born in Washington, D.C., Rep. Moore attended the University of the District of Columbia, where she majored in biology. She initially pursued a career in medicine, focusing on women’s health care. Later, she moved to Georgia over 25 years ago to seek better opportunities for her children.

She also attended Georgia Institute of Technology School of Business and transitioned her career to become an award-winning publicist through her own public relations firm. Following her passion as a recipe developer in the food arts, Rep. Moore opened a culinary arts school, Angie Mamma’s Kitchen, in Atlanta, Georgia.

Rep. Moore has been a small business owner for the past two decades and is customer, community service, and detail-oriented. As a mother, entrepreneur, political, and social advocate, Rep. Moore possesses qualities of persuasiveness, community consciousness, flexibility, decision-making, inclusiveness, tenacity, and an ability to initiate change.

She is a former Georgia foster parent, where children from all over the state affectionately call her “Miss Angela.” Her natural love and concern for children’s welfare led to the formation of the Betwixt N Between Foundation, of which she is the executive director. The foundation provides donations to children who are in between the state foster home care program and awaiting adoption.

In 2019, Rep. Moore formed the Colour Purple Foundation, which helps to subsidize terminally ill cancer patients’ last wishes. She was inspired to create this foundation after the passing of her little sister, who succumbed to gallbladder cancer, leaving her three minor children in her care.
