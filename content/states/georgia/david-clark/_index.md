Representative David Clark spent the first half of his childhood on a small farm in Suwanee, Georgia, and the last half in Buford on Lake Lanier. Politics captured him from an early age because he realized the importance of electing dedicated leaders who put the love of God, family and country ahead of themselves.

This belief led him to join the military shortly after finishing high school, inspired him through Army Ranger School and took him all the way to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

Upon completion of his six years of service, he attended Georgia Gwinnett College to pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree with a concentration in business marketing. He went on to earn his real estate license and joined two of his brothers in starting a successful real estate brokerage firm, which has since expanded into real estate management services in both the commercial and residential markets. He also owns a nutraceutical distribution company.

He currently resides in Buford, Georgia, with his wife, Courtney. He is an active member of Gwinnett Church and serves as a middle school boys transit leader.
