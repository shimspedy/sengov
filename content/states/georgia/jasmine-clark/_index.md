Dr. Jasmine Clark was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 26, 1982. From a very young age, she had a passion for the sciences and aspired to be a doctor like her father. She received her Bachelor of Science in biological sciences, with a concentration in microbiology, from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville in 2005. She then went on to receive her doctoral degree from Emory University’s Laney Graduate School in microbiology and molecular genetics in 2013 after publishing her work on retroviral particle tracking using live cell imaging microscopy. In 2014, she completed a postdoctoral project at Emory University, studying high-throughput sequencing of HIV patient samples. Jasmine currently serves as a lecturer of microbiology and human anatomy and physiology at the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing at Emory University. On November 6, 2018, she was elected to the Georgia State House of Representatives, where she currently serves as the state representative of House District 108, covering the Lilburn and Mountain Park areas of Gwinnett County.

In addition to her academic and professional accomplishments, Jasmine is a mother of two and currently resides in the Lilburn/Tucker area of Gwinnett County. When she is not teaching at Emory or legislating at the State Capitol, you can usually find her at one of her children's soccer games or track meets, or singing karaoke. Her personal philosophy can be summed up in the following quote by the late Maya Angelou: “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”
