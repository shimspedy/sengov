Bryce Berry is a dedicated and passionate politician who currently serves as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives for the 56th district. Born on June 16, 2001, in St. Louis, Missouri, Bryce was raised in a proud union household where he learned the values of hard work, integrity, and respect from an early age. His upbringing in a community that faced significant challenges shaped his commitment to positive change and social justice.

A pivotal moment in Bryce's life occurred when he was just 13 years old. The tragic shooting of Michael Brown in his hometown of Ferguson, Missouri, deeply impacted him and fueled his desire for change. This event led him to become actively involved in the Black Lives Matter movement during the Ferguson uprising. Through collective efforts, Bryce and his community achieved significant milestones, including the election of Ferguson's first Black mayor and substantial improvements in local education and healthcare.

After high school, Bryce moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to continue his education and commitment to transformative work. He attended Morehouse College, where he majored in Economics and graduated in 2023. During his time at Morehouse, Bryce served as a state youth leader for President Biden and Vice President Harris' 2020 election campaign. He also took on the role of Deputy Political Director for the 2022 Coordinated Campaign, contributing to the successes of Senator Raphael Warnock and Leader Stacey Abrams.

In addition to his political work, Bryce has been an active member of various organizations, including the Democratic Party of Georgia, the American Federation of Teachers, the Fulton County Democratic Party, and the Morehouse Alumni Association. He has also served as the president of the Young Democrats of Georgia since 2022, actively driving youth organizing efforts.

Bryce's dedication to education is evident in his career as a Middle School Math teacher in Atlanta Public Schools. He lives in the historic neighborhood of English Avenue and is a member of the Antioch North Baptist Church. His commitment to his community and his desire to represent the aspirations of a generation led him to run for the Georgia House of Representatives.

In the 2024 general election, Bryce Berry defeated incumbent Republican candidate Mesha Mainor with an impressive 83.8% of the votes. He assumed office on January 13, 2025, becoming the first Gen Z member of the Georgia State House of Representatives. Bryce's goal is to swing open the doors of opportunity for every resident in Georgia's 56th District, recognizing the weight of history in the present moment and firmly believing in the collective power to seize opportunities, bring forth results, and secure victory for the people he is committed to serving.

Bryce Berry's journey is a testament to his unwavering dedication to positive change, social justice, and community empowerment. His story continues to inspire and motivate others to join him in the transformative journey for a brighter future.
