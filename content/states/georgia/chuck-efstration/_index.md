Charles P. Efstration, III (“Chuck”) represents House District 104, which includes the Auburn, Carl, and Hamilton Mill areas of Barrow and Gwinnett counties. A former assistant district attorney and chairman of his county Republican Party, Chuck Efstration was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives on December 13, 2013 and was elected Majority Leader by his Republican colleagues in November of 2022. Prior to being elected Majority Leader, Chuck served as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and as an administration floor leader for Governor Nathan Deal.

During his time in the State House, Chuck has earned a reputation for steadfastly advancing conservative values and always standing up for the voiceless. In addition to legislation cracking down on criminal gangs, Chuck also sponsored legislation to combat hate crimes in the aftermath of the tragic Ahmaud Arbery murder.

Efstration grew up in Gwinnett County, earned his Eagle Scout with a Gwinnett Boy Scout troop and graduated from Greater Atlanta Christian School. Chuck’s mother was a longtime educator with Gwinnett County Public Schools, beginning her teaching career in 1973. Chuck’s father worked at the Western Electric factory in Gwinnett County in the early 1970s after graduating from Georgia Tech and receiving an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army.

Chuck is a graduate of the University of Georgia’s School of Public and International Affairs. While an undergraduate student, Chuck worked in two legislative sessions of the Georgia General Assembly, serving as an aide to the governor’s floor leader and as an aide to the Senate Public Safety Committee. Efstration went on to obtain his Juris Doctor from Mercer Law School in Macon. After graduating from law school, Chuck returned to his hometown and worked in law enforcement as a felony prosecutor. As an assistant district attorney, Efstration conducted jury trials prosecuting offenses including murder, rape, armed robbery, child molestation, drug possession and sale, domestic violence, computer crimes, DUI and theft. Chuck also served as a prosecutor for Juvenile Court and the Gwinnett County Drug Court program.

Prior to answering the call to run for office himself, Chuck spent many years helping elect conservative candidates across Georgia. In 2009-2010, Chuck served as chairman of the Gwinnett County Republican Party. Chuck is also a former chairman of the Georgia Association of College Republicans.

Today, Chuck owns a small family law firm in the Dacula area, and has been married to his wife, Ashley Leachman Efstration, since 2014. Together, they have two young boys. Chuck is a Greek Orthodox Christian. In his free time, Chuck enjoys hiking with his family and is an avid University of Georgia football fan.
