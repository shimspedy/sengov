State Representative Viola Davis was sworn into office as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives on January 14, 2019. She represents the citizens of House District 87, which includes portions of DeKalb County. She has been appointed to the Georgia House of Representatives Insurance, Interstate Cooperation, and Science & Technology committees.

Viola Davis, founder of Unhappy Taxpayer & Voter and a longtime government watchdog of DeKalb County, has served the public as a community missionary for over 20 years. She joined the Fulton County Taxpayer Foundation to receive training on property tax appeals and to extend property tax appeal services into DeKalb County, especially within the incorporated City of Atlanta in DeKalb and South Fulton as an outreach coordinator. After formal training with the Taxpayer Foundation, Davis moved on to blog for the Patch and Crossroads News on public and tax issues.

Viola Davis started her career of community service as an actual plaintiff in the Brown vs. Board of Education filed by the late Charles Scott Sr., mentor to her mother, Ruby Davis. She has over 10 years of experience servicing the DeKalb County community with educating the public about waste, mismanagement, and inefficiency in local and state government.

Davis led the fight to secure close to $5 million to properly close a 25-acre abandoned bankrupt landfill named Scales Landfill, the state’s largest trust fund award to cap a landfill. She was a top strategist in a two-year fight to stop the passage of the Transportation Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (TSPLOST). She joined with a coalition to place a non-binding cell tower referendum on the ballot, where she had victory, and 75,073 votes (over 62%) agreed to no cell towers on school grounds in DeKalb County. She has over ten years working successfully on major legislation. She went on to be the founder of two missions, which are Restore DeKalb and Restore MARTA.

She is an honor graduate of the Medical College of Georgia with a Bachelor of Science degree in nursing with over 23 years’ experience as a critical care nurse, administrator, and instructor. Davis is a licensed realtor and received her license in 1997. Davis was a business owner that owned and operated a hair salon called Express Cuts on Memorial Drive in DeKalb County with her sister, the late Annie Mae Davis. She is an honorably discharged Commissioned Officer of the U.S. Army and Airborne. She comes from a family of veterans and works hard to advocate for homeless veterans.

Davis has received several awards to include:
- A Citizens Award from the Rockdale County Think Tank
- A Perfect Peach Award from Georgia Watchdog
- A Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition honor presented April 2016 and issued by Congressman Hank Johnson.
- A CrossRoadsNews Community Kudos Award Dedicated Service award presented April 2016 from Jennifer Parker and Curtis Parker with Crossroads Newspaper.
- A Common Cause 2014 Democracy Award presented November 2014 issued by Georgia Common Cause.

Davis loves a challenge and seeks to provide outstanding representation to the taxpayers and voters of DeKalb County in House District 87. She strives to keep the public informed on local and state issues and legislation.
