A lifelong New Castle County resident, Kim Williams previously worked for a union electrical contractor for 12 years. She was hired as a receptionist and worked her way up to office manager. Ultimately, Kim decided to resign from her job and stay at home to raise her two children.

Being a stay-at-home mom gave Kim the opportunity to be involved in her children’s schools. While helping in the classroom and regularly attending PTA meetings, Kim became PTA treasurer and volunteered weekly for the HOST reading program. She was eventually elected PTA president four times at Forest Oak Elementary School. When her daughter entered Conrad Schools of Science, Kim was elected vice president of the PTO. She served on Conrad’s Building Leadership Committee for five years.

In 2009, Kim was elected to the Red Clay School Board, she served on the board for three years, including serving one year as vice president.

With her children enrolled in high school, Kim took the opportunity to return to the workforce. She held a Delaware real estate license and was an agent with Berkshire Hathaway Home Services. Kim currently works full-time as a legislator.

Kim represents the 19th District in the Delaware House of Representatives. She was elected in 2012 and was sworn into office in January 2013.

She and her husband, Carl, have been married for over 25 years and they have two children, Casey and CJ, as well as their adopted, former foster dog, Addy. They have lived in Klair Estates for more than 25 years.
