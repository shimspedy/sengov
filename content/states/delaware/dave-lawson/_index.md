Senator Lawson was born on October 29, 1946, in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the tenth of eleven children. Lawson and his siblings were raised on a farm in the Allegheny Mountains.

He enlisted in the United States Air Force and completed a tour of duty in Vietnam before being honorably discharged in 1969. After he retired from the Air Force, Lawson settled in Harrington, Delaware where he served as a volunteer with the Harrington Fire Company.

Senator Lawson began a career in law enforcement as a policeman with the Milford Police Department. He sought and received a transfer to the Delaware State Police where he became a State Trooper in 1973. He retired in 1992 and served as a Delaware State Police Range Instructor and as the Lieutenant of the Special Operations Response Team.
