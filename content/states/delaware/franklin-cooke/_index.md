Franklin D. Cooke Jr. was born on July 21, 1958, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. He is an American politician and a member of the Democratic party. He represents District 16 in the Delaware House of Representatives.

Cooke was elected in the general election on November 6, 2018, winning a significant 85 percent of the vote over Republican candidate Albert Ament. This victory marked the beginning of his political career as a state representative.
