Larry Lambert is a community leader and a proud lifelong resident of our 7th District (Claymont). His decades of service have been recognized by Senator Joe Biden in front of the US Congress, on the Oprah Winfrey show, in a proclamation by State Treasurer Colleen Davis, and in numerous News Journal features detailing his volunteer work across Delaware.

At a young age, Larry lost his big brother and both of his parents. At 20, he took on the responsibility of raising his little sister. It was difficult paying all of the bills, raising a teenager, and being the first Lambert to graduate from college, but Larry persevered, to prove to his sister that “no matter what we go through, we never give up!”

Larry attended Maple Lane Elementary School, went to Brandywine High School, and taught Sunday School at Concord Baptist Church (on the border of Lancashire). After earning his degree from Temple, he served as an art teacher for 8 years at the Claymont Boys & Girls Club and substituted at Brandywine High School. He then worked in corporate banking for 9 years. Larry has actively worked to build bridges between Delaware’s corporate and nonprofit sectors to bring resources into the 7th District such as road repairs, jobs, workforce development programs, mentors, homeownership seminars, air quality monitors, murals, air conditioners, free COVID-19 testing sites and boxes of fresh food for thousands of local families.
