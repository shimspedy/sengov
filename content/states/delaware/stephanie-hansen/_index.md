Sen. Stephanie Hansen represents the 10th Senate District, which includes Glasgow, Middletown, Odessa, and communities along the western side of Southern New Castle County.

Hansen graduated from Seaford Senior High School before earning a bachelor’s degree in geology from the University of Delaware and a master’s degree in earth science from the University of New Orleans. Hansen began her professional career as an environmental scientist, and later a hydrologist, at DNREC.

She entered public service as the founder and first president of the Frenchtown Woods Civic Association and then the multi-community Bear Glasgow Council of Civic Organizations. She served as president of New Castle County Council from 1996 to 2001, and, while on council, graduated cum laude from Widener University School of Law.

She practiced environmental and administrative law in Delaware from 2001 to 2020 and served as the chair and vice-chair of the Environmental Section of the Delaware Bar at various points in her career.

In early 2017, Hansen won a special election to succeed Bethany Hall-Long, who had just been elected lieutenant governor.

Sen. Hansen quickly distinguished herself as a prolific legislator best known for her work on Delaware’s energy policy, the opioid epidemic and a host of environmental and conservation issues, including the prevention of native species extinction and the promotion of renewable energy. She also formed the 10th Senate District Multicultural Committee to help foster understanding among different cultural communities and the HOA Leaders Forum for homeowner associations.

She currently serves as chair of the Senate Environment, Energy & Transportation Committee, vice chair of the Senate Elections & Government Affairs Committee, and a member of the Senate Agriculture, Education, and Health & Social Services committees. She also holds a seat on the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee.

Sen. Hansen and her husband David live in Middletown. She has five children and stepchildren, and six grandchildren.
