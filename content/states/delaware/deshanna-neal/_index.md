DeShanna Neal is a mother of four, an activist for social justice reform, and an author. They have recently become the first non-binary elected official in Delaware. DeShanna and their oldest child, Trinity, became public figures back in 2016 after news about their battle with Medicaid to cover Trinity’s gender affirming care, got around. They are responsible for the creation of Nemours pediatric gender clinic, New Castle County’s LGBTQ Youth Pride Day (Sept. 30th), and Delaware’s first ever Drag Queen Story Hour.

Prior to running for office last November, DeShanna finished their Master’s in Applied Family Science at Wilmington University and became a Certified Family Life Educator. They also founded their Delaware-based nonprofit, Intersections of Pride Foundation, which works to bridge the gaps faced by the LGBTQ community in our society. Together with their daughter, Trinity, they also wrote a children’s picture book titled, “My Rainbow,” which has been banned in several states (an accomplishment for sure).

Now, DeShanna goes by a new title: Representative DeShanna Neal. They represent the 13th District and continue their advocacy on a state legislative platform.
