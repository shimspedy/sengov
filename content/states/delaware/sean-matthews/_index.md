Sean Matthews is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Delaware House of Representatives, representing District 10. He is a member of the Democratic party.

Matthews began his political career in 2014 when he challenged and defeated the incumbent Democrat, Dennis E. Williams. This victory marked the beginning of his tenure in office. Interestingly, Williams attempted to retake his former seat in 2016, but Matthews once again emerged victorious.

In addition to his political career, Matthews is also a teacher at the Brandywine School District. His commitment to education is evident in his professional life, and it undoubtedly influences his work as a representative.

Matthews' electoral history is quite impressive. In the 2014 Democratic primary, he won with 694 votes (55%) against Dennis E. Williams. He then went on to win the general election with 3,494 votes (55.2%) against the Republican nominee, Judith Travis.

In 2016, Matthews once again faced Williams in the Democratic primary. This time, he won with an even larger margin, securing 1,308 votes (75.5%). In the general election, he won with 5,780 votes (57.5%) in a rematch against Judith Travis.

In the 2018 general election, Matthews secured 6,448 votes (68.7%) against the Republican nominee, Erin Wienner. This victory further solidified his position as a strong representative for District 10.

Throughout his political career, Matthews has demonstrated a strong commitment to his constituents and has worked tirelessly to represent their interests in the Delaware House of Representatives.
