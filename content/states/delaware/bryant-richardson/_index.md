Bryant Richardson is an American politician who is a Republican member of the Delaware Senate, where he has represented the 21st District since 2015. He assumed office on January 13, 2015, succeeding Robert Venables Sr.

Richardson's journey into politics began with the 2012 election for Delaware State Senate District 21. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary on September 11, 2012, but was defeated by incumbent Robert Venables in the general election on November 6, 2012, securing 6,889 votes (43.0%).

Undeterred, Richardson ran again in the 2014 election for Delaware State Senate District 21. Once again, he ran unopposed in the Republican Primary on September 9, 2014. This time, however, he defeated incumbent Robert Venables in the general election on November 4, 2014, with 5,210 votes (53.0%).

Richardson continued his political career by running for reelection in the 2018 election for Delaware State Senate District 21. He was unopposed in the primary and defeated Democrat Bob Wheatley in the general election on November 6, 2018, with 8,816 votes (65%).

In 2020, Richardson ran in the Republican primary election for Governor of Delaware. He came in third place with 4,262 votes (7.7%) behind Colin Bonini (34.6%) and the eventual Republican nominee for governor, Julianne Murray (41.2%). Murray ultimately lost the general election to incumbent Governor, John Carney, after garnering 38.62% of the statewide vote.

Apart from his political career, Richardson served in the United States Army Reserves for six years. He and his wife, Carol, have three children together: Leanne, Paul, and Daniel. They also have five grandchildren: Hannah, Hughie, Henry, Luke, and Annie.

Richardson and his wife, Carol, are the owners of Morning Star Publications, Inc., which publishes the Laurel Star, Seaford Star, and Salisbury Star. Additionally, they publish biannual magazines for five local chambers of commerce and numerous specialty publications.

Senator Richardson served as President of the Western Sussex Citizens for Life, and is a member of the Greater Seaford Chamber of Commerce and Seaford Kiwanis Club.
