State Rep. Kevin Hensley was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2014. He represents the 9th District, which includes the Odessa, Townsend, and Port Penn areas.

Outside of his legislative duties, Kevin also runs his own small business, serving as an Associate Broker with RE/MAX Premier Properties.

A Founding Member of the MOT Charter School and a Past School Board Member of the Appoquinimink School Board, Kevin is committed to working to improve public education in Delaware. One of his most important accomplishments has been championing legislation that has earmarked millions of dollars in state funding for school safety and security improvements throughout Delaware.

As the father of a child with intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDD), Kevin is also a champion for nonprofit causes that support members of the IDD community, including Easterseals and Ability Network of Delaware. In October 2022, Kevin received the “I/DD Champion Award” from Ability Network of Delaware for his efforts in securing increased state funding to go toward the Direct Support Professional care of individuals with disabilities.   

Prior to being elected himself, Kevin had the honor of serving as a Legislative Assistant to the late U.S. Senator William V. Roth, where his passion for public service really began.

Kevin serves on the following House Committees; Economic Development/Banking/Insurance & Commerce; Education; Health & Human Development; Housing & Community Affairs; and Veterans Affairs. He also serves on the ad-hoc House Small Business Caucus.

Kevin has two grown children: Julia and Ryan.
