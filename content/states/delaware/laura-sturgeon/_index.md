Sen. Laura Viviana Sturgeon represents the Fourth Senate District, which includes West Talleyville, Greenville, Centreville, Hockessin and parts of Pike Creek.

The daughter of Argentine immigrants, Sturgeon has lived or worked in Delaware since she was just over a year old. A proud graduate of Brandywine High School, she later earned a bachelor’s degree in communications and a master’s degree in English literature, both from the University of Delaware.

Sturgeon worked as a public school teacher for 25 years before retiring from her job teaching Spanish at Concord High School in late 2019. She previously taught English at Delcastle Technical High School, where she was the 2001 Teacher of the Year, and at Hodgson Vocational Technical High School, where she was the English Department Chair from 2006-2009.

Prior to running for public office, Sturgeon served in an appointed position on her local teacher union’s executive committee and later won a seat on the board of the Delaware State Education Association, the largest union in the state. Those experiences, combined with her passion for women’s rights and her desire to help mold public education policy, inspired her to run for a seat in the Delaware General Assembly.

In 2018, Sturgeon become the first Latina ever elected to the Delaware State Senate, which stands as one of her proudest accomplishments.

Sen. Sturgeon currently serves as chair of the Senate Education Committee and a member of the Senate Corrections & Public Safety, Environment, Energy & Transportation, and the Health & Social Services committees. She also holds a seat on the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee.

She and her husband Bill live in Woodbrook with their standard poodle and rescued cat.
