Rep. Wilson-Anton was elected in 2020 to represent the 26th district where she grew up.  She attended Gauger-Cobbs Middle School and graduated from the Charter School of Wilmington. She is an alumna of the University of Delaware and holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in International Relations and Asian Studies. She has formally studied Arabic, Chinese, French, and Spanish.

While at the University of Delaware, Rep. Wilson-Anton was actively involved in several campus organizations where she held leadership positions, including the Muslim Student Association, Students for Justice in Palestine, and her sorority Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad/Lambda Pi Chi Sorority, Inc.

She worked for two years as a legislative fellow in the state legislature, and an additional year as a legislative aide for the 26th and 27th districts. In these capacities, she researched legislation, staffed committee meetings, and communicated with residents and helped them with a variety of issues. This experience gave her first-hand exposure to the issues and concerns of her fellow community members.

As a state representative, Rep. Wilson-Anton is fighting for social, economic, and racial justice for all Delawareans.
