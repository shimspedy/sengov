Sen. Bryan Townsend represents the 11th Senatorial District, which covers the Southern Newark area, including portions of Bear and Glasgow.

Bryan and his wife Lilianna, a fellow attorney and a first-generation Vietnamese American, are the proud parents of two young, spirited sons Logan and Landon.

Bryan is the son of a retired Newark police officer and a retired public school teacher. He graduated from Glasgow High School in 1999 before attending the University of Delaware (economics/philosophy/biology), the University of Cambridge (Chinese studies), and Yale Law School.

After law school, Bryan returned to Delaware to clerk for Chancellor William Chandler III of the Delaware Court of Chancery. He then became an attorney focused on Delaware corporate litigation, and has represented Delaware businesses of all sizes, as well as children in foster care, victims of domestic violence, and a veteran with service-related disabilities.

Bryan also has volunteered with the Christiana Volunteer Fire Co., Special Olympics Delaware, the Food Bank of Delaware, and Big Brothers Big Sisters Delaware.

He was first elected to the Delaware Senate in 2012. The Senate Democratic Caucus elected him Majority Whip in 2018. He has served as Majority Leader since 2020.

Bryan currently serves as chair of the Senate Labor Committee and vice chair of the Senate Executive, Housing & Land Use, and Legislative Council committees. He is also a member of the Senate Judiciary and Rules & Ethics committees.
