Retired critical care nurse and healthcare consultant, Valerie Jones Giltner of Georgetown, became the newest member of the Delaware House of Representatives after winning a special election on December 21, 2023.

The election was needed after former Rep. Ruth Briggs King announced her resignation in mid-November in advance of moving into her family’s new home, just outside the district. Under state law, all members of the General Assembly must reside in the districts they represent. Rep. Jones Giltner will serve the time remaining on the pre-existing term of office, which ends November 5th.

Among Rep. Jones Giltner’s top public policy priorities are protecting citizens from burdensome regulations, maintaining secure classrooms, and improving healthcare.

While Rep. Jones Giltner immediately began representing the citizens of 37th District on the night she was elected, she was officially sworn-in to office when the Delaware House of Representatives convened on January 9, 2024.
