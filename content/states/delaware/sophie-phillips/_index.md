Representative Phillips has focused her work on environmental justice throughout the state of Delaware with an emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in parks. Over the past few years, she has worked on expanding urban green space in Wilmington, Delaware and in Baltimore, Maryland in partnership with community groups.

As Miss Delaware 2021 in the Miss America Organization, she worked with young people throughout the state on professional development. Through the creation of community gardens, she taught communities how to grow, harvest, and cook their own food.

She has an extensive background in wildlife studies and environmental field work. She loves the outdoors and wants to continue to work on increasing access to environmental careers.

She worked as a student ambassador with Title IX at the University of Delaware. She helped create the “kNOw MORE” campaign that educates University faculty, staff, and students about sexual violence, healthy relationships, and discrimination.

She possesses a Bachelor of Science Degree with Distinction from the University of Delaware in Environmental and Marine Science and a Master’s Degree from the University of Delaware in Energy and Environmental Policy
