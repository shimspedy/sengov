Frank Burns is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Delaware House of Representatives, representing the 21st district. He assumed office on November 5, 2024, succeeding Republican Mike Ramone, who resigned to run for governor. Burns has a strong background in science and environmental advocacy, which has significantly influenced his political career.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Burns pursued higher education with a focus on science. He earned a bachelor's degree from Villanova University in 1981 and a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1986. His academic achievements led him to direct laboratories at MCP Hahnemann University and Jefferson Medical College. Burns lived in Pennsylvania for several years while commuting to work in Delaware before finally moving to Delaware in 2017.

Burns has been actively involved in environmental and climate advocacy, which played a crucial role in his decision to enter politics. In 2022, he filed to run against incumbent Republican Mike Ramone for the 21st district seat in the Delaware House of Representatives. Although he lost the general election by a narrow margin of 35 votes, the small difference triggered a mandatory recount. Despite both candidates losing votes in the recount, the difference increased by six votes to 41.

Undeterred by the loss, Burns announced in July 2023 that he would run against Ramone again. However, Ramone decided not to seek reelection to the House and instead ran for governor of Delaware. Brenda Mennella became the Republican nominee for the 21st district seat. Burns faced nonprofit director Michael Smith in the Democratic primary election and won by 30 votes. During his campaign, Burns prioritized education funding reform and advocated for the establishment of an independent office of the inspector general to investigate state corruption. He also received an endorsement from the Working Families Party.

In the general election, Burns won against Mennella with 58% of the vote, securing his position as the representative for the 21st district. As a member of the Delaware House of Representatives, Burns serves on several committees, including Natural Resources, Health, Transportation, Labor, and Veterans Affairs. His scientific background and commitment to environmental issues continue to shape his legislative priorities and actions.

Burns also runs a small biotech company, further demonstrating his dedication to scientific advancement and innovation. His career experience and advocacy work have made him a prominent figure in Delaware politics, and he remains committed to serving his constituents and addressing the pressing issues facing his district and the state.
