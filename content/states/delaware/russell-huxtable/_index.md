Sen. Russell Huxtable represents the Sixth Senate District, which includes Milton, Lewes, Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach.

A graduate of Mount Pleasant High School, he earned a bachelor’s degree in political science and government from the University of Delaware. Throughout high school and college, Huxtable volunteered with the Appalachia Service Project, a home repair service ministry that operates in the Central Appalachia region.

After college, Huxtable spent two decades with local nonprofits committed to helping Delaware families find affordable housing, including stints as a self-help housing specialist at NCALL Research, director of homeownership programs at Interfaith Housing Alliance and most recently as vice president of the Milford Housing Development Corp. As a nationally recognized leader in affordable housing, he also has served as a member of the Delaware Governor’s Council on Housing and as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh’s Affordable Housing Advisory Council.

Sen. Huxtable was elected to the Delaware Senate in 2022, becoming the first Democrat to represent Sussex County in the General Assembly’s upper chamber since 2015.

He currently serves as chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee and vice chair of the Senate Environment, Energy & Transportation Committee, as well as a member of the Senate Banking, Business, Insurance & Technology, Housing & Land Use, the Legislative Oversight & Sunset and Veterans Affairs committees.

Sen. Huxtable lives outside Lewes with his wife Courtney and their two children, both of whom attend school in the Cape Henlopen School District.
