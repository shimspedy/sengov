Sen. S. Elizabeth “Tizzy” Lockman represents the Third Senate District, which encompasses communities in central and west Wilmington and reaches into New Castle County to the South, including portions of Newport.

Raised in Wilmington’s Cool Spring neighborhood, Lockman graduated from Alexis I. duPont High School. She later earned a bachelor’s degree from New York University and a master’s degree in urban affairs and public policy from the University of Delaware.

Lockman entered community service in 2004 through Public Allies Delaware, where she served as program manager for Serviam Media’s Hearts & Minds Film Initiative. When her daughter enrolled in kindergarten at Joseph E. Johnson Elementary (formerly Highlands Elementary,) Lockman joined the Parent Teacher Association and served as the group’s president from 2010-2013.

From there, she was appointed to the Wilmington Education Advisory Committee by then Gov. Jack Markell and later served as vice chair of the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission, while also working as director of the Parent Advisory Council on Education (PACE) initiative at the Christiana Cultural Arts Center.

Lockman was elected to the Delaware Senate in 2018, becoming just the second African American woman elected to the General Assembly’s upper chamber. Sen. Lockman has served as Majority Whip since 2020.

Sen. Lockman currently serves as chair of the Senate Housing & Land Use Committee, chair of the Senate Rules & Ethics Committee, vice chair of the Senate Education Committee, and a member of the Senate Environment, Energy & Transportation, Executive and Legislative Council committees.

She also serves as co-chair of the Redding Consortium for Education Equity, which is tasked with spearheading the search for ways the Delaware Department of Education and the General Assembly can work together to improve outcomes for students in Wilmington and Northern New Castle County.

Sen. Lockman lives in Wilmington with her husband John, her infant son Jack and her daughter Sophie (when she comes home from college).
