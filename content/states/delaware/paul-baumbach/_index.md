Paul S. Baumbach is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He represents District 23 in the Delaware House of Representatives. He assumed office on November 7, 2012, following the retirement of Democrat Teresa Schooley.

Baumbach was born and raised in the United States. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Delaware, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in 1983. He furthered his education at Villanova University, where he earned a Master of Science degree in Computer Science in 1988.

In addition to his political career, Baumbach has professional experience as a financial planner, investment advisor, and business owner. In 1996, he founded Mallard Advisors, an independent fee-only financial planning firm, in Newark, Delaware, where he manages the Newark office.

Baumbach's political career began with his election to the Delaware House of Representatives in 2012. He won the three-way Democratic primary with 546 votes (38.9%), and went on to win the general election with 4,770 votes (57.3%) against Republican nominee Mark Doughty. In 2014, Baumbach was unopposed in the general election and won 3,740 votes. Similarly, in 2016, Baumbach was unopposed in the general election and won 6,550 votes. In 2018, Baumbach was unopposed in the general election and won 5,786 votes.

Throughout his tenure, Baumbach has been a long advocate and supporter of assisted suicide. Since 2015, he has campaigned for the state of Delaware to legalize assisted suicide. He has proposed several bills to authorize doctors to prescribe life-ending medications to patients who request it. In 2022, he created and sponsored a new bill to legalize the process. The bill was heard before the House Health and Human Development Committee, and narrowly passed it by a 8-7 vote. During the hearings, about 60 to 70 people testified about the legislation.

Baumbach's current term ends on November 5, 2024.
