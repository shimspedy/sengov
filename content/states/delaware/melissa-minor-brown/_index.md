Rep. Melissa ‘Mimi’ Minor-Brown is determined to make a difference by using her platform as a springboard for change, advocacy, and empowerment for her community. Rep. Minor-Brown knows what it means to work hard. She is an American success story, pulling herself up as a single teenage mother to evolve into a licensed practical nurse, to a registered nurse with a master’s degree in Executive Leadership, graduating Cum Laude from Wilmington University, to now serving as a legislator in Delaware’s House of Representatives.

Rep. Minor-Brown’s call to service started a decade ago while working with our state’s servicemembers at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Elsmere, Delaware. During her seven-year tenure, she listened to the stories, challenges, and concerns of her patients which propelled her run for office because it was the better pathway to meet their needs.

Rep. Minor-Brown continues to offer a hand up to those she serves. She is staunch supporter for the less fortunate and always strives to provide a voice for the voiceless. She is an advocate for nursing continually seeking opportunities to advance the profession. To that end, Rep. Minor-Brown has been recognized as a Delaware Top Nurse Honorable Mention in 2018 and 2022. She was recently awarded the Dr. Kitty Esterly Health Equity Award from Delaware Healthy Mother and Infant Consortium where she serves as the lead for the Doula Task Force and the Social Determinants of Health Committee. She also was awarded the 2023 Delaware Top Nurse in the Leading and Advancing the Profession category.

On a broader scale, Rep. Minor-Brown serves as the Region III Chair for the National Black Caucus of State Legislators.
