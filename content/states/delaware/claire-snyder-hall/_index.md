Claire Snyder-Hall is the State Representative for the 14th District, serving Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach, and the southern part of Lewes in Coastal Sussex.

Prior to her election to the General Assembly in 2024, Snyder-Hall led the Delaware office of Common Cause for five years, where she worked to protect and strengthen democracy in the First State, supporting the freedom to vote, advocating for campaign finance reform and fair redistricting, and working to strengthen transparency and accountability.

Snyder-Hall has held a range of leadership positions within the Democratic Party over the course of eight years, including four years as chair of RD 14. She ran for state senate unsuccessfully in 2014 and has worked on a number of issue campaigns, including marriage equality, death penalty repeal, and protections for manufactured homeowners. She has experience working with emotionally disturbed and chemically dependent adolescents and has also done prison ministry at Sussex Correctional.

Before moving to Rehoboth full-time in 2011, Rep. Snyder-Hall was a tenured faculty member at George Mason University, where she taught political philosophy and directed a number of academic programs, as well as leading the American Democracy Project on campus, a program that aims to encourage civic participation among undergraduates. Overall, she has 20 years of classroom teaching experience and has written three books and dozens of articles on a range of topics.

She holds a PhD in political science with a specialization in democratic theory and a BA cum laude from Smith College.
