Mara Gorman represents the 23rd District which includes the western and northern side of the City of Newark, White Clay Creek State Park and parts of  lower Pike Creek. She is a parent and an advocate, who has worked for years to end gun violence and foster inclusivity and racial equity in Delaware.

Mara came to the gun safety movement organically in 2015, shaken to her core by the massacre in Sandy Hook and by the amount of gun violence in the First State. She worked for years as the volunteer Moms Demand Action Chapter Lead to help pass gun safety laws.

She also served as the Public Affairs Manager for Planned Parenthood of Delaware, working to make sure that every Delawarean has access to the reproductive healthcare that they need. She is a member of the Newark Branch of the NAACP and formerly served as the chair of its Political Action Committee.

Mara is a writer and a two-time fellow of the Delaware Division of the Arts who believes in the importance of arts education for every child – and adult – in Delaware. Whether it’s writing, visual art, or music, she believes art enriches our lives and our communities and brings us together.
