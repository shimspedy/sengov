A lifelong Delawarean and graduate of St. Mark’s High School, Walsh is an electrician by trade and has been a proud member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 313 for nearly 38 years.

From 1993 to 2002, he served on Local 313’s board of directors, executive board and its political action committee. He also led the union’s Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee from 1996 to 2001. Today, Sen. Walsh works as a project manager for Preferred Electric Inc.

He entered public service as a long-time member of the Montclare Civic Association, where he served as president. He then was elected to the Delaware Senate in 2016.

Since joining the Senate, Sen. Walsh has focused on economic development, education, workforce issues and animal abuse legislation.

He currently serves as chair of the Senate Capital Improvement Committee, vice chair of the Senate Labor Committee and a member of the Senate Banking, Business, Insurance & Technology Committee, Housing & Land Use and Veterans Affairs committees.

He also serves as vice president of the board of directors for the Humane Animal Partners, a board member of the Certified Thoroughbred Program, and a board member of the Delaware Prosperity Partnership, a nonprofit co-funded by the state and the private sector to lead economic development efforts in the First State.

Sen. Walsh is a former baseball coach for Midway Little League and St. John the Beloved, where he and his family have long been parishioners.

He and his wife Jeanmarie live near Pike Creek, where they raised their three children Ryan, Lindsey and Kelsey. Walsh is the proud grandfather of three grandchildren, Ava, Emery, and Brayden.
