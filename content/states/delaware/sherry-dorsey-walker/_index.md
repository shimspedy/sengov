Representative Sherry Dorsey Walker, a native of Wilmington, Delaware, is the first Person of Color elected to the Delaware House of Representatives from the 3rd District in 2018. As well, she is First Woman and the First Person of Color elected in the 6th District to the Wilmington City Council in 2012. She earned a Masters in Film Production from Howard University and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Delaware in English/Journalism. She is a proud product of St. Elizabeth School, where she attended for 12 years.

In 2001, Sherry established SWAP Productions LLC, an independent film production company. SWAP is an acronym for Sisters With A Purpose. Sherry humbly believes that her purpose in life is to educate, entertain and enlighten through her films and her public service. For this reason, she conceptualized “Justice For All: The Documentary,” a film focusing on the perils of the juvenile justice system in America and overseas. It was this project that helped change the laws at the federal level regarding juvenile justice, after it was screened before the Congressional Black Caucus.

Also, Sherry serves on the following committees in the House: Chair of the Sunset Committee (Policy Analysis and Government Accountability), Co-chair of the Joint Sunset Oversight Legislative Sunset Committee, Agriculture, Economic Development/Banking/Insurance and Commerce, Revenue and Finance (Vice Chair), Judiciary and Veterans.

She is the former Vice Chair of the Delaware Legislative Black Caucus, which she helped found in 2019, after an unprecedented eight People of Color were elected to the General Assembly in 2018. She sponsored SB 191 in the House in the 150th General Assembly to add People of Color, as a protected class to the Delaware State Constitution. In the 151st General Assembly, she sponsored SB 31 the second leg of the amendment adding People of Color as a protected class in Delaware. She is the sponsor of HB 198 adding Black History to the State’s Curriculum; HB 195 Body Worn Cameras for all officers; HB 72 creating equity and inclusion for procurement opportunities for People of Color; SB 83 Community Reinvestment Act making it possible for Black-Owned Financial Institutions to establish in Delaware; HB 318 creating a compact with other states enabling spouses of Veterans to be certified as School Counselors and Educators to address the staffing shortages in the state and HB 25 Same Day Voter Registration just to name a few.

As a City Councilwoman, Sherry worked tirelessly to foster relationships among businesses, governmental agencies and schools. Sherry established Above The Rim Basketball League with the Browntown Civic Association Kidz Club. With the help of the community, Sherry created a crime-fighting program using solar-powered lights. The lights were strategically placed in high-crime areas and the program drastically reduced crime in the neighborhood. Also, Sherry advocates for educators, children and their families in the school and local communities. Moreover, Sherry literally walks the streets of her district, in an effort to identify constituents who desire to work and assists them with becoming gainfully employed. She continues these same efforts as a State Representative. She recently received the Trailblazer Award from the Sigma Zeta Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. She also received the FBI Citizens Award for her work in the community. The Department of Defense recognized Sherry for her work on HB 318. In 2022, she was inducted into the Hall of Fame at St. Elizabeth School.

Additionally, Sherry is Co-Chairwoman of the Teen Warehouse Board, Vice Chair of the Board of Directors for Kind to Kids, a Board Member of the following: Camp Bliss, Delaware Agricultural Museum, Diamond State Pearls, Incorporated and #TeamJalil. She is the former Member of the Board of Parole, Commissioner for the Governor’s Women’s Commission, the Biden Breast Health Initiative, former Vice President of the Delaware Africa Caribbean Coalition, St. Michael’s Day School Board Member and Public Allies of Delaware Board.
