State Rep. Jeff Hilovsky was elected to serve the residents of the 4th District (Oak Orchard, Long Neck, Angola) in 2022. As a result of population growth, he is the first legislator elected to serve this new district in Sussex County as a result of the mandated re-districting process.

Rep. Hilovsky has served the community as he treated patients for nearly 40 years as a Doctor of Optometry, Adjunct Clinical Professor, State Board President, and past member of the National Board of Examiners.

Additionally, retired Colonel Hilovsky served our country for 25 years in the Air Force culminating with his war time leadership as the Medical Commander for the 512th Air Wing at Dover Air Force Base during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

In addition to his medical and military careers, Rep. Hilovsky has business ownership experience. Partnering with a colleague, they established Sussex Eye Center in 1993 and grew the business into a multi-location practice employing seven doctors and over 25 employees before retiring in 2022.

Seeking to fill a need in the lives of many young people, Dr. Hilovsky started the Leadership is a Lifestyle program. Now featured at three Sussex County high schools, this volunteer initiative provides leadership instruction and also opportunities to interact with uniquely successful professionals. This training provides participating students insights into how servant leadership skills help all reach their lifeâ€™s full potential.

Rep. Hilovsky also serves the community by volunteering with Easter Seals of Sussex County, the Lord Baltimore Lions Club, and Chestnut Mountain Ranch.

Jeff and wife Marcia have been married for over 42 years, have three grown children, and five grandchildren.
