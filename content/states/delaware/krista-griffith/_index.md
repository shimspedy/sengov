Krista M.Z. Griffith is State Representative for the 12th District of Delaware, which includes neighborhoods in Wilmington, North Wilmington, Greenville, and Hockessin. She is a parent, attorney and advocate who has dedicated her career to protecting Delaware residents and improving the lives of people of all ages. Her work has helped ensure that Delawareans, including the most vulnerable, have access to economic and educational opportunity as well as equitable treatment by the justice system.

Krista served for nearly a decade as a Deputy Attorney General in the Delaware Department of Justice under the administrations of Beau Biden and Matt Denn.  Krista led Attorney General Biden’s Senior Protection Initiative and was assistant unit head of the Department of Justice’s Domestic Violence and Child Abuse units. She also represented state agencies including the Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families. Currently, Krista serves as CEO of the Children’s Advocacy Center of Delaware.

Krista knows first-hand the healthcare challenges confronting Delaware families.  When her younger son, Nate, faced a life-threatening leukemia diagnosis, Krista left the Department of Justice in 2015. She spent months at Nate’s bedside while he underwent successful cancer treatment.

Krista has dedicated hundreds of hours to board leadership and community service for several nonprofit organizations in Delaware including the Down Syndrome Association of Delaware.
