Kamela T. Smith is a dedicated and influential member of the Delaware House of Representatives, representing the 15th district. She assumed office on November 5, 2024, succeeding Valerie Longhurst. Kamela is a member of the Democratic Party and has also been affiliated with the Working Families Party.

Kamela Smith was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She attended the University of Pittsburgh, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1994. During her time at the university, she was an active member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, which played a significant role in shaping her commitment to community service and leadership.

After completing her education, Kamela moved to Delaware in the early 2000s with her family. As a single mother, she faced numerous challenges but remained steadfast in her dedication to improving the lives of those around her. She began her career in the mental health department of a local nonprofit organization, where she worked tirelessly to support individuals and families in need.

Kamela's passion for community service led her to join ChristianaCare, where she eventually became the director of community education and engagement. In this role, she focused on promoting health and wellness initiatives, as well as fostering strong connections between the healthcare system and the community. Her work at ChristianaCare earned her recognition and respect from her colleagues and the community at large.

In addition to her professional accomplishments, Kamela has been actively involved in various community organizations. She served on the board of trustees at the Kalmar Nyckel Foundation and was a member of the James H. Gilliam program run by the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League. These experiences further solidified her commitment to social justice and community empowerment.

In December 2023, Kamela announced her intention to run for the Delaware House of Representatives for the 15th district, which includes the community of Bear. Her decision to run was driven by her desire to bring about positive change and address the pressing issues facing her constituents. Kamela faced a tough primary challenge against Valerie Longhurst, who had held the seat since 2004 and was the active Speaker of the House. Despite the odds, Kamela's progressive platform and endorsement from the Working Families Party resonated with voters, leading to her victory in the primary with 53.3% of the vote.

Kamela went on to win the general election unopposed, marking the beginning of her tenure in the Delaware House of Representatives. As a legislator, she has focused on issues such as healthcare, education, and economic development. Kamela is a member of several committees, including Education, Health & Human Development, Revenue & Finance, Technology & Telecommunications, and Transportation.

Throughout her career, Kamela Smith has demonstrated unwavering dedication to her community and a strong commitment to public service. Her journey from Philadelphia to the Delaware House of Representatives is a testament to her resilience, determination, and passion for making a difference in the lives of others.
