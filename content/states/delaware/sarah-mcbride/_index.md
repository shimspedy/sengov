Senator Sarah McBride represents the First State Senate District, which includes Bellefonte, and parts of Alapocas, Edgemoor and Wilmington.

Raised in Wilmington, McBride has been involved in community advocacy for most of her life, including working for former Governor Jack Markell, the late Attorney General Beau Biden, and as a White House intern during the Obama Administration.

She later served as a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ equal rights organization. McBride teaches public policy at the University ofDelaware and is the author of the 2018 memoir, “Tomorrow Will Be Different.”

Prior to being elected to the State Senate, McBride led the successful effort to pass a landmark non-discrimination law in Delaware, worked with state leaders to expand healthcare covered by Medicaid, and championed legislation protecting vulnerable youth from child abuse.

For her work and advocacy, former Gov. Markell awarded McBride the Order of the First State, making her one of the youngest Delawareans granted the state’s highest civilian honor. When McBride was elected to the state Senate in 2020, she became the first openly transgender state senator in American history.

As a state senator, McBride has passed legislation expanding access to health care, requiring mental health and media literacy education in public schools, promoting green technologies, and protecting workers and families. In just her first term, McBride also passed the landmark Healthy Delaware Families Act, providing paid family and medical leave to workers throughout the First State and marking the largest expansion of Delaware’s social safety net in decades.

She currently serves as chair of the Senate Health & Social Services Committee, and a member of the Senate Banking, Business, Insurance & Technology, Education, Executive and Judiciary committees.

Sarah married her late husband Andrew Cray in 2014 and is the proud aunt of Juliette, Theo, Bennett, Sydney, Teagan, Ben and Addison.
