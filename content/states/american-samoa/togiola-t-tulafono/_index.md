Togiola Talalelei A. Tulafono was born on February 28, 1947, on the island of Aunu'u in American Samoa. He is a distinguished American Samoan politician and lawyer, known for his extensive public service and leadership. Tulafono's early education took place in Samoa, where he attended elementary school in Autu'u and later graduated from Samoana High School. He pursued higher education in the United States, earning bachelor's degrees in political science and sociology from Chadron State College in 1970. He furthered his education by obtaining a Doctor of Laws degree from Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas, in 1975.

Tulafono's career began in the legal field, where he worked as a legal assistant at the American Samoa Attorney General's Office. He also served as an administrative assistant for the Secretary of Samoan Affairs. His dedication to public service led him to various roles, including a private practice attorney and vice president for South Pacific Island Airways. In 1978, he was appointed as a district court judge, marking the start of his judicial career.

In 1980, Tulafono entered the political arena by being elected to the American Samoa Senate, representing Sa'Ole County. After serving one term, he returned to law practice but re-entered the Senate in 1989, this time representing Sua County. His political career continued to flourish as he served eight years in the Senate. During this time, he also chaired the board of directors for the American Samoa Power Authority and was the first chairman of the Board of Higher Education.

Tulafono's leadership extended beyond politics. He co-chaired the South Pacific Mini Games committee in 1997 when American Samoa hosted the games. His commitment to community service is evident in his role as a deacon of the Congregational Christian Church in Sa'ilele, American Samoa, a position he has held for over 25 years.

In 1997, Tulafono was elected as the seventh lieutenant governor of American Samoa, serving under Governor Tauese Pita Fiti Sunia. Following the sudden death of Governor Sunia on March 26, 2003, Tulafono became the acting governor and was officially sworn in as the sixth governor of American Samoa on April 7, 2003. He was elected to a full four-year term in the November 2004 gubernatorial elections and was re-elected in November 2008. During his tenure, he focused on developing American Samoa's infrastructure, including highways and internet communications, and promoting the preservation of the territory's traditional culture and natural environment.

After completing his term as governor in January 2013, Tulafono continued to be active in public service. He ran for American Samoa's at-large congressional district in 2014 but was unsuccessful. Despite this setback, his legacy as a dedicated public servant and leader remains significant.

Tulafono is married to Mary Ann Tu, and together they have five daughters and one son. His contributions to American Samoa's political landscape and his commitment to public service have left an indelible mark on the territory.
