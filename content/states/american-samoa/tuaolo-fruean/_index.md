Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, born in March 1945, is a distinguished American Samoan politician, judge, and civil servant. His career spans several decades, marked by significant contributions to the governance and judicial systems of American Samoa.

Fruean began his public service career as an associate judge of the High Court of American Samoa. His judicial experience laid a strong foundation for his subsequent roles in the legislative and executive branches of the government. He first entered the political arena as a member of the American Samoa House of Representatives, where he served for ten years. His tenure in the House was characterized by his commitment to justice and public safety, values that he carried into his later roles.

In the 2000 elections, Fruean was elected to the American Samoa Senate, representing the Maʻopūtasi County district. He served as a Senator from 2001 to 2008, during which time he was known for his leadership and dedication to his constituents. Following the death of Senate President Lutu Tenari Fuimaono, Fruean served as president pro tempore of the Senate. Although he was a candidate for Senate President after the 2004 elections, he was not elected to the position.

After his initial term in the Senate, Fruean continued to serve the public in various capacities. In 2009, he was nominated as Commissioner of Public Safety in the Cabinet of Governor Togiola Tulafono. His tenure as Commissioner was marked by efforts to enhance public safety and law enforcement in American Samoa. In 2013, he was confirmed as the Chief Election Officer, a role in which he oversaw the electoral processes and ensured their integrity.

Fruean returned to the Senate in 2015, replacing Mauga Tasi Asuega, who had been appointed Secretary of Samoan Affairs. He was re-elected in the 2016 and 2020 elections, demonstrating the continued trust and support of his constituents. In January 2021, he was unanimously elected as President of the Senate, a testament to his leadership and experience.

Throughout his career, Tuaolo Manaia Fruean has been a steadfast advocate for justice, public safety, and good governance. His extensive experience in the judiciary, legislative, and executive branches of government has made him a respected and influential figure in American Samoa.
