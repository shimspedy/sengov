This academic achievement equipped him with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complexities of political and public service.

Before entering the political arena, Vaivao built a career as a customs officer, working in the OIC vessel unit at the U.S. Department of Treasury Customs division.

He has championed initiatives to enhance school facilities, provide better resources for teachers, and create scholarship programs for deserving students. His dedication to education stems from his belief that a well-educated populace is the foundation of a prosperous and resilient community.

In addition to his work in education, Vaivao has been a strong proponent of healthcare reform. He has worked tirelessly to ensure that all residents of American Samoa have access to quality healthcare services. This includes advocating for the expansion of medical facilities, increasing the availability of essential medications, and supporting programs that promote preventive care and healthy living.
