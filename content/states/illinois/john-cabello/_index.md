State Representative John Cabello (R-Machesney Park) was appointed to fill a vacancy in the 68th District and sworn into office in August of 2012. He was then elected to that seat in November of 2012 and re-elected in 2014, 2016 and 2018. In 2022, John was elected State Representative for the new 90th District which starts in Boone County and cuts across the top of Winnebago County out to Stephenson County and Freeport. Originally from Texas, John and his family moved to Machesney Park when he was a young child. He is a graduate of Harlem High School in Machesney Park. He was also a member of the acclaimed Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps. John began serving his community after graduation from the police academy by becoming a police officer for South Beloit. He later worked for the Rockford Police Department and in a short period of time, he became a detective. John has served nearly three decades as a police officer and is currently on the roster of the Rockford Police Department. Representative Cabello previously served on Appropriations-Capital; Appropriations-Public Safety (Republican Spokesperson); Transportation: Regulation, Roads; Labor & Commerce; Judiciary â€“ Criminal committees. His expertise in law enforcement was utilized during his terms in office and was especially needed during the riots and the rise of the anti-police movement that has fueled a resurgence in violent crime. John has been elected, and served, as a Harlem Township Trustee and a Winnebago County Board member for District 8. In those positions, he declined pay and benefits further demonstrating his commitment to public service. He resides in Machesney Park. John is a conservative Republican who has opposed the tax and fee increases and believes that government should live within its means. In Illinois, state policies and taxation have driven people and businesses out leaving the remaining to pay the bills for the state spending. John is going back to Springfield to fight for the principles that will make our state great again.
