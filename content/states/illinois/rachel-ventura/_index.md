Rachel Ventura was born and raised in Joliet, Illinois, in a working-class family. She attended public schools and was taught the value of hard work and union labor from a young age. She received a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Benedictine University and an associate’s degree in Biology from Tidewater Community College in Virginia.

Ventura has a diverse professional background, with experience as an actuary, naturalist, veterinary assistant, substitute teacher, and business director. This varied experience has equipped her to meet the diverse set of challenges facing Illinoisans in the State Senate.

Before joining the Illinois Senate, Ventura served on the Will County Board from 2018 to 2022. As chair of the Public Health and Safety Committee, she focused on providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic, tackling homelessness, and expanding mental and behavioral health care. She is committed to addressing the root causes of crime rather than upholding the regressive and punitive policies of the past.

While on the board, Ventura successfully organized for the county to adopt the Greenest Region Compact, setting forth bold green energy and sustainability goals for Will County. She also served as Vice President of the Forest Preserve District of Will County.

In the Illinois Senate, Ventura continues her advocacy for affordable housing, equitable job opportunities, and reforming oppressive systems that harm our most vulnerable neighbors. She represents Illinois’ 43rd Senate District, which includes portions of Bolingbrook, Joliet, Lockport, Romeoville, and surrounding communities.

Ventura has a strong electoral history. She served on the Will County Board's 9th District from 2018 to 2022. She also ran against Bill Foster in the 2020 U.S. House of Representatives Primary Election for Illinois's 11th Congressional District, though she ultimately lost to Foster. In the 2022 Illinois 43rd Senate District Democratic Primary, she won with 57.65% of the votes. In the General Election, she won with 56.05% of the votes.

In addition to her political career, Ventura has an interest in tabletop games and has written a Dungeons & Dragons adventure called A Feast of Flavor, which was nominated for an ENNIE award in 2018.
