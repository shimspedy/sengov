Terra Costa Howard is a dedicated legal advocate for vulnerable children, seniors, and families. She is also a small business owner. Born and raised in DuPage County, Illinois, she has a deep connection to her community.

Costa Howard earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Juris Doctor degree from DePaul University. Her education laid a strong foundation for her career in law and public service.

Before her tenure in the Illinois House of Representatives, Costa Howard served as the president of the Glen Ellyn School District 41 Board. She has always been actively involved in her community. In addition to her work on the school board, she was a member of the Parent Teacher Association and a Girl Scout leader.

In 2018, Costa Howard was first elected as the Illinois State Representative for the 48th district. The 48th district includes all or parts of Glen Ellyn, Lisle, Lombard, Wheaton, and Villa Park. She defeated incumbent and House Republican Floor Leader Peter Breen in the 2018 general election. She again defeated Breen in the 2020 general election.

During her tenure, Costa Howard served on several committees and subcommittees. These included the Adoption and Child Welfare Committee, the Appropriations - Higher Education Committee, the Appropriations-Elementary & Secondary Education Committee, the Appropriations-Human Services Committee, the Judiciary - Civil Committee, the Mental Health & Addiction Committee, the Tourism Committee, and the Transportation: Vehicles & Safety Committee.

Costa Howard introduced several pieces of legislation in the Illinois House of Representatives that have gone on to become law in Illinois. One notable piece of legislation was HB12, which she sponsored. This bill allowed employees of a school district, public university, or community college district who had been employed for at least 12 months and who has worked at least 1,000 hours in the previous 12-month period to be eligible for family and medical leave under the same terms and conditions provided to eligible employees under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. This legislation was passed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Costa Howard resides in DuPage County with her spouse and their three daughters. In addition to her work as a state representative and attorney, she is an adjunct professor at the College of DuPage.
