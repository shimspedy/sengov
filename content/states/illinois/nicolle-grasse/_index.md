Nicolle Grasse is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing District 53. She assumed office on June 5, 2024, after being appointed to replace former Representative Mark Walker. Grasse's current term ends on January 13, 2027. She ran for re-election in the general election on November 5, 2024, and won, continuing her commitment to serving her constituents.

Grasse's journey in public service began long before her tenure in the Illinois House of Representatives. She served as a village trustee in Arlington Heights, Illinois, starting in 2021. Her career experience includes being an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ and a hospice chaplain. These roles have allowed her to support people from all walks of life, providing comfort and guidance during some of their most challenging times.

Born and raised in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, Grasse grew up as the oldest of four children in a family of small business owners and proud union workers. Her upbringing in the Northwoods, surrounded by the beauty of the outdoors and a close-knit community, instilled in her a deep sense of responsibility and a desire to make the world a better place for everyone. From a young age, she was aware of the disparities and injustices faced by many, which fueled her passion for public service.

Grasse's dedication to helping others is evident in her extensive work as a hospice chaplain. She began her hospice work during the AIDS crisis and continued to serve as a front-line healthcare worker during the COVID-19 pandemic. Her commitment to supporting people from diverse backgrounds and finding solutions to their problems has been a hallmark of her career.

In addition to her professional achievements, Grasse is a devoted wife and mother. Her husband, Michael, was a math and physics teacher in High School District 214 for his entire career and continues to be involved in public education even after retirement. Their daughter, Claire, attended public schools in Arlington Heights and is currently studying to be a teacher at Michigan State University.

Grasse's public service extends beyond her professional roles. She is an active community builder, collaborator, and advocate for justice. Her work in local government and hospice care has equipped her with a unique skill set of hard work, commitment, and integrity. She is dedicated to being a strong voice for the needs and concerns of all residents in her district.

As a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, Grasse continues to build on her lifetime foundation of public service. She is committed to listening to her constituents, involving them in creating solutions to problems that matter most, and working together to make the world a better place for everyone. Her passion for community building, collaboration, and advocacy drives her to be an effective and compassionate leader.
