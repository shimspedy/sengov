Patrick Sheehan is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives for the 37th district since April 12, 2024. He was appointed to replace Tim Ozinga, who resigned from his position. Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Sheehan graduated from Christ the King Catholic School. Before entering politics, he had a long career in law enforcement, working as a police officer for the Plainfield Police Department for nearly two decades.

Sheehan's dedication to public service extends beyond his work in law enforcement. He has been actively involved in his community, serving as a Lockport Alderman, President of the Lockport Jr Porters Football & Cheer Program, and a former Lockport Parks Commissioner. His commitment to making Illinois a safer place for families is evident in his work to build trust between law enforcement and residents, advocate for safer communities, and promote proactive strategies to fight crime in high-crime neighborhoods.

In the Illinois House of Representatives, Sheehan is a member of several committees, including the Appropriations - Public Safety Committee, Counties & Townships Committee, Elementary & Secondary Education: Administration, Licensing & Charter Schools Committee, Energy & Environment Committee, Ethics & Elections Committee, Restorative Justice Committee, and the Revenue & Finance Committee. His legislative priorities include capping gasoline taxes, eliminating the grocery tax, and enacting policies to recruit job creators back to Illinois. By expanding the tax base with a more business-friendly environment, Sheehan aims to avoid tax hikes on residents and job creators.

Sheehan's dedication to serving as a voice for seniors, parents, and hardworking taxpayers is evident in his collaborative approach to creating a safer and more affordable Illinois. He recognizes the impact of inflation on families across suburban communities and is committed to addressing these challenges through his legislative work.

Patrick Sheehan resides in Lockport, Illinois, with his wife, Susie, and their five children. His deep roots in the community and extensive experience in public service make him a valuable representative for the 37th district.
