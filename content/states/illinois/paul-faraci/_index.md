Paul Faraci is a Democratic member of the Illinois Senate from the 52nd district. The 52nd district includes Champaign, Danville, Rantoul, St. Joseph, and Urbana. Faraci was appointed to succeed Scott Bennett in the 103rd General Assembly.

Faraci was born in Chicago, Illinois to Piero and Flora Faraci, well-regarded Champaign restaurateurs and small business owners. They were the owners of Great Impasta and Jane Addams Book Shop in Downtown Champaign. Faraci later opened and operated his own restaurant in Downtown Champaign, the City of New Orleans.

Faraci has worked for the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and the Illinois Treasurer. On December 9, 2022, Scott Bennett died from complications due to a brain tumor. This created a vacancy for both the remainder of the 102nd General Assembly and the 103rd General Assembly to which Bennett had been elected. Scott Bennett's widow, Stacy, was appointed to fill the remainder of Scott's term in the 102nd General Assembly.

On January 7, 2023, Faraci was appointed by the Democratic county party chairpersons of Champaign and Vermilion County to serve in the 103rd General Assembly. He took office on January 11, 2023.

Before serving as a State Senator, Faraci was a small business owner, worked as a senior account manager for the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity --focusing on economic development – and served as a senior advisor to State Treasurer Michael Frerichs.

Faraci’s previous public service includes serving as the City of Champaign Township Assessor, Champaign City Council from 2011-2017 and Deputy Mayor City of Champaign 2015-2017. Faraci served as a board member at Champaign County First, a united county wide effort to identify projects that will spur economic development and improve quality of life in Champaign County.

During his time with DCEO Faraci worked to spur economic development. His achievements include helping secure $3.4 million for Bell Helmet in Rantoul, $2.5 million to Epi Works in Champaign and $1.5 million for Viscofan USA in Danville.

Faraci has a history of civic engagement and public service. Faraci is a loving husband and father of one.
