Senator Chris Balkema is a dedicated public servant and a prominent figure in Illinois politics. He currently represents the 53rd District in the Illinois State Senate. Senator Balkema's journey in public service began when he was elected to the Grundy County Board in 2010. His leadership and commitment to fiscal responsibility were evident during his tenure as Chairman of the Board, a position he has held since 2016. Under his guidance, the county successfully lowered the property tax levy for four consecutive years and implemented a five-year plan to pay off all bonds, ultimately achieving a debt-free status. This accomplishment is a testament to his ability to develop focused and assertive leaders who execute established goals while nurturing talent from within the organization.

In addition to his political career, Senator Balkema has an extensive professional background. He has worked at Caterpillar Inc. for over three decades, holding various leadership positions in Human Resources, Operations, Logistics, and Purchasing. His experience in the private sector has provided him with valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by businesses and workers alike. This unique perspective has been instrumental in shaping his approach to governance and policy-making.

Senator Balkema is also deeply involved in his community. He serves on the Grundy County Economic Development Council and has held advisory positions on the Taylor University Business Advisory Council. His commitment to community service extends to his local church, where he is an active member. Senator Balkema's educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in Business Systems from Taylor University, which he earned in 1993, and a Master of Business Administration from Bradley University, obtained in 2002.

On a personal note, Senator Balkema and his wife have been happily married for over twenty-six years and are proud parents of two sons who are currently in college. The family resides in Channahon, Illinois, where they are actively engaged in their community. Senator Balkema's dedication to public service, combined with his professional experience and community involvement, make him a respected and influential leader in the Illinois State Senate.
