Omar Aquino is an American politician who has made significant contributions to the state of Illinois. Born on June 24, 1987, in Chicago, he has emerged as a passionate advocate for his community and a champion of shared values.

Early Life and Education
Aquino grew up on the Northwest Side of Chicago, where he was deeply influenced by his Puerto Rican heritage. Both of his parents worked in public service: his mother in the Chicago Public Schools and his father in the Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation. These early experiences instilled in him a commitment to public welfare and community well-being.

He attended Lincoln Park High School and later pursued higher education at Loyola University Chicago. There, he earned a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice and a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 2009. His academic background laid the foundation for his future endeavors in public service.

Commitment to Public Service
Aquinoâ€™s journey in public service began as a bilingual case manager with the Illinois Department on Aging. In this role, he served low-income elderly clients in Chicago through the Community Care Program. His dedication to assisting vulnerable populations fueled his desire to create positive change.

Subsequently, he worked as a Legislative Aide in the Illinois House of Representatives, gaining firsthand experience in the legislative process. His commitment to community empowerment led him to serve as an Outreach Coordinator for Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth.

Political Career
In 2015, Aquino ran for the newly created 36th Ward in the Chicago aldermanic elections. Although he received the most votes in the February election, he narrowly lost in the April runoff. Undeterred, he set his sights on a broader platform.

In January 2016, Aquino announced his candidacy for the 2nd District State Senate seat, which was being vacated by William Delgado. His campaign garnered widespread support, including endorsements from Delgado himself, committeemen, elected officials, labor groups, and progressive organizations. In the March 2016 Democratic primary, he secured victory against his opponent, Angelica Alfaro, with a 53% to 47% margin.

At the age of 29, Aquino was sworn into office, becoming the youngest-ever Latino member of the Illinois State Senate. His dedication to public service and commitment to his constituents have made him a respected figure in Illinois politics.

Legislative Contributions
As a state senator, Aquino has actively participated in various committees, including:

Appropriations - General Services Committee
Appropriations Committee
Education Committee
Energy and Public Utilities Committee
Executive Committee
Executive Appointments Committee
Executive - Elections Committee
His tireless efforts continue to shape policies, improve education, and enhance the lives of Illinois residents.
