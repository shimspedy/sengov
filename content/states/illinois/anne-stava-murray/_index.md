Anne Stava-Murray is a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives for the 81st district. She took office on January 9, 2019. The 81st district, located in DuPage and Will counties, includes all or portions of Downers Grove, Lisle, Naperville, Woodridge, Darien, Westmont, and Bolingbrook.

Stava-Murray narrowly defeated Republican incumbent David Olsen despite spending only $30,000 during the entire 2018 election cycle. Stava-Murray, a Naperville resident, served on the community’s Board of Fire and Police. She is a graduate of Dartmouth College.

Stava-Murray originally announced a run for the United States Senate in 2020 on January 1, 2019, but she would later call off the bid in March according to the Daily Herald, "largely because she found out she had been mistaken in her belief that [Dick] Durbin was not going to seek re-election," and chose to seek a second term as state representative.

As of July 3, 2022, Representative Stava-Murray is a member of the following Illinois House committees: Appropriations - Elementary & Secondary Education Committee (HAPE), Appropriations - Human Services Committee (HAPH), Citizen Impact Subcommittee (HMAC-CITI), Housing Committee (SHOU), Immigration & Human Rights Committee (SIHR), Judiciary - Criminal Committee (HJUC), Museums, Arts, & Cultural Enhancement Committee (HMAC).

Before her political career, Anne Stava-Murray worked as a professionally trained researcher, serving as the “voice of the consumer” in the private sector. She learned how to ask the right questions and use the combined intelligence of people and data to create the best path forward. In her first two terms as State Representative, Anne has voted to work towards the goals many of our district share: To ensure Illinois takes a dramatic turn towards long-term financial stability via comprehensive reforms, which has resulted in the first credit ratings increase in over 20 years. To secure our future, serving families and residents across all life-stages: on everything from pandemic recovery to serving as the Vice Chair on the Immigration and Human Rights committee.

Anne formerly served as a Commissioner on the Naperville Board of Fire & Police, which oversees hiring and promotions for the Fire & Police departments. A co-founder of the Naperville WMA (Women’s March Action), she organized several events focused on increasing kindness & respect in our community and accountability & transparency for politicians.

Before graduating from Dartmouth College, she attended a range of public and private area schools: Scott School, The Avery Coonley School, and Benet Academy. In her free time, Anne enjoys connecting with family & friends, painting with alcohol inks, bowling, and a wide range of craft endeavors.
