Daniel Didech is a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives for the 59th district. The district, located in the Chicago metropolitan area, includes all or part of Vernon Hills, Prairie View, Buffalo Grove, Indian Creek, Lincolnshire, Mundelein, Riverwoods, and Wheeling.

Didech won election as the Vernon Township Supervisor in 2017. The following year, he was elected to the Illinois House to succeed retiring Democratic Representative Carol Sente, defeating Republican opponent Karen Feldman. As of July 3, 2022, Representative Didech is a member of the following Illinois House Committees: Clean Energy Subcommittee (HENG-CLEA), Commercial & Property Subcommittee (HJUA-COMM), Counties & Townships Committee (HCOT), Energy & Environment Committee (HENG), Ethics & Elections Committee (SHEE), Housing Committee (SHOU), Judiciary - Civil Committee (HJUA).

Daniel Didech was raised in Buffalo Grove by a family of small business owners. A graduate of Stevenson High School and District 96 schools, after completing law school Daniel returned to the community with his wife, Jen, who is a 6th grade math teacher at Twin Groves Middle School. They live in Buffalo Grove with their two children and dog, Captain Hook.

When he turned 16, Daniel’s first job was as a union seat vendor at Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox games. As a teenager taking the Skokie Swift and the red line every day to work in the service industry, Daniel learned early the value of a strong work ethic, respect and equality, and the belief that every worker deserves the right to earn middle-class wages.

During law school, Daniel worked at Jewish Child & Family Services where he advocated for children with special needs and their families. In addition to serving as Representative for District 59, Daniel works as a local government attorney, providing legal counsel to suburban villages, school districts, park districts and community colleges.

From 2017-2019, Daniel served as the elected Supervisor of Vernon Township. In his first year as Vernon Township Supervisor, Daniel cut the township’s property tax levy by over 5%, while at the same time expanding services that the township provides to our community. He did this by identifying alternative sources of revenue so the township is less reliant on property taxes, and by cutting wasteful and unnecessary administrative expenses.

Daniel has also fought to save taxpayers more money by championing the consolidation of the Vernon Township Road District, an unnecessary and wasteful taxing body that operates with virtually no oversight or accountability. Under Daniel’s leadership, Vernon Township transformed its food pantry into a “grocery store experience.” Now our community’s most vulnerable neighbors, including seniors, immigrants and single mothers, are provided with healthful foods in a dignified manner. He also modernized and professionalized operations, and rejected an unfair pay raise authorized by his predecessor.

As State Representative, Daniel continues the tradition set by his predecessors, Carol Sente and Kathy Ryg, of being an accessible and hard-working leader in the community. He regularly attends local board and community meetings, holds meet-and-greet and town hall events, and talks to our neighbors on their doorsteps about their concerns and ideas to move our state forward.

Third-term Representative, Daniel serves as Chairman of the Illinois House Gaming Committee. He also serves on the Ethics & Elections, Financial Institutions & Licensing, Judiciary – Civil, and Personnel & Pensions Committees, and is Sub-Chairperson for the Commercial & Property Subcommittee. He has previously served as Vice Chair of the Energy & Environment Committee, and has served on the Counties & Townships and State Government Administration Committees, the Commercial Law, Family Law, and Consolidation & Tax Subcommittees, and as the Sub-Co-Chairperson of the Government Process Subcommittee.
