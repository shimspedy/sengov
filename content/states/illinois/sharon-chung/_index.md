Sharon Chung is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Illinois House of Representatives for the 91st district. She is a mother, county board member, dedicated teacher and musician, and lifelong Illinoisan. As a natural communicator, collaborator, and problem-solver, Sharon is committed to being a strong voice, advocating for the hard-working people of the newly-drawn 91st House District.

Born and raised in the Chicago suburbs, Sharon is the daughter of Korean immigrants. She moved to Bloomington to attend college at Illinois Wesleyan University. After graduation, she and her husband Jeremy were drawn back to the community as a place to start their family. Together with their daughters, Sophie and Mia, Sharon and Jeremy have been proud to call Bloomington home since 2009.

In 2018, Sharon was elected to the McLean County Board, representing the residents of District 7. She has served on the Land Use and Development, Health, and Justice Committees, and together with her colleagues, has brought increased transparency and accessibility to the board and county government. Sharon has been an advocate for openness and commonsense solutions during her time on the board.

As a professional violist and violinist, Sharon has performed on numerous stages throughout Central Illinois. During the spring and summer of 2020, Sharon and her friends performed throughout the Bloomington-Normal area in various outdoor neighborhood concerts as the Antiviral Musiciansâ€™ Collective. At a time when people were confined to their houses, she saw this as an opportunity to share beauty and provide hope to the community that has given her and her family so much through the years.

Sharon assumed office on January 11, 2023. Her current term ends on January 8, 2025. She is running for re-election in 2024. As state representative, Sharon will be a dedicated advocate for working families, a compassionate ally for the marginalized, and a tireless fighter for the residents of the 91st District.
