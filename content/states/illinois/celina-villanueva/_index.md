Celina Villanueva is a Democratic member of the Illinois Senate representing the 12th district. She was born in Chicago and raised in Little Village. She is a full-time state legislator and a community organizer. She is also an avid reader.

Before her political career, Villanueva worked as a Civic & Youth Engagement Manager at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. She is an alumna of the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign where she earned a B.A in Latina/Latino Studies with minors in African-American Studies and Spanish.

She started her political journey when she was appointed to the Illinois House of Representatives on July 24, 2018, to replace Silvana Tabares, who in turn had been appointed to fill a vacancy as alderman of Chicago's 23rd Ward. The appointment was conducted by a panel of local Democratic leaders chaired by Senator Steven Landek, the Committeeman from Lyons Township. Villanueva was one of five candidates.

Villanueva was sworn into the Illinois House of Representatives on July 24, 2018, immediately after her appointment to fill a vacancy. That vacancy arose when sitting Rep. Silvana Tabares was appointed to fill a Chicago City Council vacancy caused by the resignation of Ald. Michael Zalewski. Villanueva won re-election unopposed in the November 2018 election.

During her first term, Villanueva was a leader in pushing for a bill that limit how much public agencies in Illinois could cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In November 2019, Villaneuva launched a campaign to replace resigning Illinois State Senator Martin Sandoval. On January 7, 2020, Villaneuva was appointed to become state senator of the 11th district, after Sandoval's resignation amid a corruption probe.

As of July 2022, Senator Villanueva was a member of the following Illinois Senate committees: Appropriations - Higher Education Committee (SAPP-SAHE), Appropriations - Human Services Committee (SAPP-SAHS), Higher Education Committee (SCHE) (Chairwoman of), Human Rights Committee (SHUM).
