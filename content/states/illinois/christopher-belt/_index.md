Christopher Belt is a dedicated public servant and a lifelong resident of Illinois’ Metro East area. He grew up in Centreville and now represents Illinois’ 57th Senate District. This district encompasses communities in St. Clair and Madison counties, including Belleville, Collinsville, O’Fallon, Granite City, Freeburg, Mascoutah, and Scott Air Force Base.

Before serving in the Illinois Senate, Belt had an 18-year career as a law enforcement officer. He spent 16 years with the St. Clair County Probation and Detention Center and two years as the regional deputy administrator of Aftercare for the central and southern regions of Illinois.

In 2003, Belt founded the Difference Makers Professional Organization. This organization is dedicated to strengthening the decision-making capabilities of young men between the ages of 9 and 18. Belt's experiences as a father and a mentor led him to recognize the vital role of education in the development of young people. To make a difference, he served four years on the board of Cahokia Unit School District 187, including two years as board president.

Belt is a graduate of Lincoln Sr. High School in East St. Louis. He holds a bachelor’s degree in history from Illinois State University, as well as master’s degrees in public administration from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and in professional counseling from Lindenwood-Belleville.

During the 103rd General Assembly, Belt served as Chair of the Senate Appropriations-Public Safety and Infrastructure Committee. He was also a member of the Education, Energy and Public Utilities, Insurance, Labor, Licensed Activities, and Transportation Committees.

Belt resides in Swansea with his wife, Stephanie, and his children, Christianna and Stephon. His commitment to public service and his dedication to his community are evident in his work both in and out of the Senate.
