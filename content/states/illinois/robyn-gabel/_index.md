Pritzker appointed Gabel to Powering Illinoisâ€™ Future transition committee, which is responsible for infrastructure and clean energy policies.

On January 13, 2023, House Speaker Chris Welch named Gable the House Majority Leader. She succeeds Greg Harris in the position.

Throughout her career, Robyn Gabel has demonstrated a strong commitment to serving the people of Illinois as an advocate for all, especially women, children, and the most disadvantaged. As majority leader, her priorities include advocating for a racial equity agenda, ethics reform, expanding affordability and access to quality health care, comprehensive clean energy policy, and increasing safety net funding for our most vulnerable residents.
