Martha Deuter, also known as Marti, is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing District 45. She assumed office on January 8, 2025, after winning the general election on November 5, 2024. Her current term is set to end on January 13, 2027.

Marti's journey into public service began with her education. She earned a bachelor's degree from Ohio University in 1995 and a graduate degree from the University of Chicago in 1998. Her academic background laid a strong foundation for her career in government and nonprofit sectors.

Before her tenure in the Illinois House of Representatives, Marti served on the Elmhurst City Council, where she chaired the Development, Planning, and Zoning Committee. Elected in 2013, she has been an influential figure in local government, serving on all four of the council's standing committees and holding leadership positions since 2015. Her work in Elmhurst focused on critical issues such as emergency response, public safety, infrastructure, and financial stability.

Marti's experience extends beyond local government. She worked for eight years for the City of Chicago, where she directed the Department of Housing's federal, state, and local policy agendas. During her tenure, she managed the creation of the Chicago Community Land Trust and the department's senior and five-year affordable housing plans.

In addition to her government work, Marti has made significant contributions to the nonprofit sector. At Woodstock Institute, a research and policy organization in Chicago, she focused on housing affordability and community reinvestment. She advocated for legislative changes to address payday lending and predatory lending. As director of a grant-funded project at DePaul University's Institute for Housing Studies, she packaged data for researchers and policymakers to further the preservation of affordable rental housing. Currently, she works for Bridge Communities, a nonprofit based in Glen Ellyn that provides housing and supportive services for families experiencing homelessness.

Marti's dedication to public service is driven by her passion for addressing tough issues and working with all stakeholders to shape positive outcomes. She is known for her ability to bring people together, a skill honed through her training as a social worker. Marti received a master's degree from the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration and an undergraduate degree in social work from Ohio University. Her background in social work has equipped her with the skills to listen, meet people where they are, and work toward consensusâ€”an invaluable asset in today's political environment.

As a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, Marti continues to advocate for policies that support working families, invest in education, strengthen public safety, and expand economic opportunities. Her commitment to public service and her ability to navigate complex issues make her a respected and effective leader in her community and beyond.
