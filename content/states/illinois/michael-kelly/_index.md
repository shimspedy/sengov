Michael Kelly, born on June 23, 1975, is a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives from the 15th district. His political journey began with his appointment on November 23, 2021. The 15th district, located in the Chicago area, includes parts of Glenview, Morton Grove, Niles, Park Ridge, and Skokie and includes parts of the Chicago neighborhoods of Albany Park, Forest Glen, Irving Park, Jefferson Park, North Park, and Norwood Park.

Kelly was appointed in 2021 to succeed longtime Democratic State Representative John C. D'Amico, who retired earlier in November that year. He grew up in Albany Park, Chicago, and attended Saint Edward Elementary School and St. Patrick High School. He later graduated from Quincy University with a degree in business management.

Before his political career, Kelly worked on political campaigns for then-State Representative John C. D'Amico, Alderman Samantha Nugent, and former Alderman Margaret Laurino. He has served as a firefighter for the Chicago Fire Department since 2003 and works as an athletic director for Saint Edward School.

As of July 3, 2022, Representative Kelly is a member of the following Illinois House committees: Cities & Villages Committee (HCIV), Police & Fire Committee (SHPF), and Transportation: Vehicles & Safety Committee (HVES).

In the electoral history, Kelly won the Illinois 15th Representative District Democratic Primary in 2022 with 52.36% of the votes. In the general election, he secured his position with 65.57% of the votes.

Kelly's current term ends on January 8, 2025, and he is running for re-election to the Illinois House of Representatives to represent District 15. He is on the ballot in the Democratic primary on March 19, 2024.
