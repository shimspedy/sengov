Nick Smith is a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing the 34th District. With over 24 years of community and civic engagement combined with a diverse academic, as well as work history makes State Representative Nicholas “Nick” Smith an excellent leader for the 34th House District of the Illinois General Assembly. Since 1994, Nick has volunteered his time and energy to serving others. Improving the quality of life for residents on the Southside of Chicago and beyond has always been his passion. Nick's civic involvement began in Chicago's 6th Ward when, John Steele was Alderman. There he met many people from the community, one in particular Barack Obama who administered his deputy registrar training class. From that moment a permanent volunteer was found in Nick. His civic activities continued with Freddrenna Lyle volunteering in the 6th Ward. Nick assisted in the formation of the 87th & Cottage Grove TIF advisory council and spearheaded the SOAR community development corporation. He has served as a commissioner for the Roseland Medical District, and on the Chicago Police Department 5th District Advisory Council. Throughout his years he has visited Springfield on many occasions, as a guest of the recently retired State Senator Donne Trotter or as an advocate for Chicago State University. Receiving his primary and secondary education from the Chicago Public School system, Nick attended Robert A. Black Magnet School, Whitney Young Magnet High School, Florida A&M University, Olive Harvey College, and Chicago State University. He was conferred a bachelor’s degree in chemistry and has taken graduate courses in community and economic development, higher education administration and briefly studied law at Northern Illinois University.
