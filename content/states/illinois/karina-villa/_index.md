Karina Villa is a full-time state legislator and a lifelong resident of the 25th Senate District of Illinois. She was born and raised in West Chicago, Illinois. She is the child of immigrant parents and comes from a family of local small business owners. Her family has been small business owners within the community for many decades, leaving a strong impact not only on herself, but within the community as well. Their family grocery store opened doors for members within the community, assisting people with advice and job referrals. Working at her family’s store gave her insight that social responsibility and hard work are essential to any undertaking.

She earned her Master's degree in Social Work from Aurora University and pledged a lifelong commitment to helping children in need. As a result, she became a school social worker, working in the West Chicago and Villa Park school systems.

Before her political career, she served as the Vice President of the West Chicago District 33 Board of Education, where she worked to maintain a balanced budget for the school district, while negotiating equitable teacher contracts and providing increased services to students.

She was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 2018 and used her social work background, leadership, and life experience to ensure effective representation in the 49th District. During her tenure, she tackled many issues that have impacted her district, in order to better serve her constituents. This includes fighting for manufacturing employee rights during the height of the COVID pandemic, championing increased access to mental health services, and ensuring quality of care is improved for our senior community.

In 2020, she was elected to the Illinois Senate, becoming the first Latina to represent her district. She currently serves as Chair of the Public Health committee, and is on the Agriculture, Appropriations, Behavioral and Mental Health, Special Committee on Pensions, Human Rights, and Health and Human Services Committees.

With Karina’s social work background, she wants to ensure that everyone knows that they can contact her office, which is why her office has an open door policy and her staff is readily available to assist you with any concerns, thoughts, or resources you may need.
