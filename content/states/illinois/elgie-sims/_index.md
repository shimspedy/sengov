Elgie R. Sims Jr. is a distinguished member of the Illinois State Senate, representing the 17th district. The 17th district includes the Chatham neighborhoods of Chicago along with all or parts of Burnham, Calumet City, Lansing, Ford Heights, Lynwood, Sauk Village, Beecher, Manteno, and Grant Park.

Born on September 21, 1970, in Chicago, Illinois, Sims is a second-generation small business owner who currently resides in Chicago's Chatham community. He grew up in Chicago's far south side West Pullman neighborhood and is a graduate of Quigley Preparatory Seminary South High School in Chicago.

Sims received his Bachelor of Science degree from Illinois State University. He got his start in government while serving as the first African American Student Regent representing Illinois State University to the Board of Regents, the former governing board for Illinois State University, Northern Illinois University, and the former Sangamon State University (now the University of Illinois at Springfield).

Following graduation from Illinois State University, Sims worked for former Senate President Emil Jones Jr. as a budget analyst, eventually rising to become Appropriations Director. During his service with Jones and the Illinois Senate Democratic Caucus, Sims completed a Master's in Public Administration at the University of Illinois at Springfield.

Upon leaving his service with the Illinois Senate Democratic Caucus, Sims started a consulting firm and attended the Loyola University Chicago School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree and subsequently opened a law firm.

Sims' electoral history is noteworthy. After winning the March 2012 Democratic primary for State Representative of the 34th District and while awaiting the 2012 general election, on August 3, 2012, Sims was appointed to the Illinois House of Representatives to succeed and complete the unexpired term of Constance A. Howard.

On January 26, 2018, Sims was appointed to the Illinois Senate to complete the unexpired term of Donne Trotter following his resignation; he was elected to a full term in the Senate on November 6, 2018. Nicholas Smith was appointed to succeed Sims in the Illinois House and took office on February 3, 2018.

Later that year, Sims was elected to serve as the chair of the Council of State Governmentsâ€™ Midwestern Legislative Conference. During his time in the Illinois House of Representatives, Sims served as chairman of the House Judiciary - Criminal Committee, during which he has concentrated on Criminal Justice Reform.
