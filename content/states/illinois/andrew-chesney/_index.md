Andrew S. Chesney is an American politician who is an elected Republican member of the Illinois Senate for the 45th district. The 45th district is located in the northwest corner of the state and includes all of Jo Daviess, Stephenson and Carroll counties as well as part of, Ogle, Winnebago, Boone, and DeKalb counties.

Born on January 11, 1982, in Freeport, Illinois, Chesney graduated Cum Laude from Arizona State University. Prior to his election to the Illinois House of Representatives, he was an Alderman-at-large in the City of Freeport, a member of the Stephenson County Convention and Visitors Bureau, and a member of the Illinois WorkNet Center for Stephenson, Jo Daviess, and Winnebago counties.

Chesney was sworn into office on December 5, 2018, after winning the 2018 general election. He was appointed to succeed Brian W. Stewart for the remainder of the 100th General Assembly. He is also the Chairman of the Stephenson County Republican Central Committee.

As a senator, Chesney is a conservative voice in Springfield, a defender of Second Amendment rights, personal freedom, the men and women of law enforcement, and the rights of parents to make decisions affecting their childrenâ€™s health, education, and welfare. While maintaining a strong fiscal conservative voting record, Chesney has chosen to protect the families of Northwest Illinois and to not support increased taxation or use fees.

Chesney was one of the three Petitioners who officially launched the internal special investigation committee of former Speaker of the House Mike Madigan. He has been a leading voice for the elimination of corruption in state government and the accountability of elected officials as a sponsor of ethics reform legislation.

While serving in the House of Representatives, Chesney was the author and Chief Sponsor of the Bill that banned the exploitation and sale of dogs from Puppy Mills that proliferated within the State of Illinois.

Chesney's story is a true Illinois story. He was raised in Shannon, Illinois, earned his bachelor degree from Arizona State University and returned to Illinois to Freeport where he now lives with his wife Kelly and their two dogs, Hector and Paley.
