Seth Lewis is a proud and dedicated public servant who currently serves as the Senator for the 24th District of the State of Illinois. He assumed this role in January 2023, following two years of service in the Illinois House of Representatives.

Before his service in the General Assembly, Senator Lewis was a trustee for the Bartlett Fire Protection District. This experience laid the groundwork for his commitment to public service and community involvement.

In the House of Representatives, Seth is credited with passing Cal’s Law, which ensures children diagnosed with cancer have greater access to critical diagnostic testing. This law is a testament to his dedication to improving the lives of the people he serves.

He also created the State’s first Indian American Advisory Council. This council celebrates and brings a legislative voice to Illinois’ Indian American community, further demonstrating his commitment to diversity and inclusion.

Senator Lewis grew up in a family where strong morals, integrity, volunteerism, and public service were instilled as core values. He carries these values into his role as a state legislator.

He earned a bachelor’s degree in Manufacturing Engineering at the University of Iowa and previously served as Vice President of Operations for a small manufacturing business in Melrose Park. His background in engineering and business provides him with a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing his constituents.

In addition to his current work in the Senate, he is an independent business owner and agent with State Farm Insurance. This experience gives him firsthand knowledge of the challenges and rewards of running a small business.

Senator Lewis and his wife, Bhavna, live in Bartlett, and together they have two adult sons. Outside of work, Seth enjoys playing golf, hunting, fishing, and spending time with his family.

The 24th District of Illinois, which he represents, is located in the west Chicago suburbs. It includes all or portions of Addison, Bartlett, Bloomingdale, Carol Stream, Elk Grove Village, Hanover Park, Itasca, Roselle, Naperville, Warrenville, West Chicago, Wheaton, Winfield, and Wood Dale in DuPage and suburban Cook Counties.
