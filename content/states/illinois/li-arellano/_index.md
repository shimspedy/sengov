Liandro “Li” Arellano, Jr. is a distinguished member of the Illinois State Senate, representing the 37th Senate District. Born and raised in Dixon, Illinois, Li has always been deeply connected to his community. His journey to the Senate is marked by a blend of military service, entrepreneurial spirit, and a commitment to public service.

Li Arellano's early life was shaped by his experiences in Dixon, where he developed a strong sense of duty and responsibility. He attended the University of Michigan, but his education was interrupted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Driven by a desire to serve his country, Li enlisted in the U.S. Army. His military career is notable for its dedication and bravery, with three combat deployments under his belt. Currently, he serves in the Army Reserves as a Squad Leader for the 317th Engineer Construction Company in Homewood, Illinois.

After his military service, Li returned to Dixon and embarked on a career in public service. He was elected as the Mayor of Dixon, serving two terms and gaining extensive experience in economic development, infrastructure investment, and long-term fiscal planning. His tenure as mayor was marked by significant progress in these areas, earning him a reputation as a forward-thinking and effective leader.

In addition to his public service, Li is also a successful small business owner. At the age of 26, he opened his first restaurant, a local franchise that provided him with valuable insights into business management, development, and entrepreneurship. His business acumen has been a cornerstone of his approach to governance, emphasizing efficiency, transparency, and ethical practices.

Li Arellano's election to the Illinois State Senate in January 2025 was a natural progression of his commitment to public service. As a state senator, he represents a diverse district that includes all or parts of Bureau, DeKalb, Henry, LaSalle, Lee, Marshall, Ogle, Peoria, Rock Island, Stark, Whiteside, and Woodford counties. In the Senate, he serves as the Minority Spokesperson on the Senate Public Health Committee and is a member of several other committees, including Health & Human Services, Local Government, Pensions, State Government, and Veterans Affairs.

Throughout his career, Li has been guided by a commitment to creating a more efficient, transparent, and ethical state government. He advocates for job growth, reduced regulation, and lower taxes, aiming to leave a legacy of responsible governance for future generations. His dedication to his constituents and his ability to listen and respond to their needs have made him a respected figure in Illinois politics.

Li Arellano's personal life is equally fulfilling. He married his high school sweetheart, Jamie, just before his first deployment. Together, they have five children, and their family life is a source of great joy and inspiration for him. Li's story is one of dedication, service, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, both in his professional and personal life.
