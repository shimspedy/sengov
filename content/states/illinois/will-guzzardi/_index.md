Will Guzzardi is a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives who represents the 39th District. The 39th District includes parts of the Avondale, Belmont Cragin, Hermosa, Old Irving Park, Portage Park and Logan Square. Guzzardi is a co-chair of the Illinois House's Progressive Caucus.

Guzzardi was born in New York City. He grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, before attending Brown University for college, where he graduated with a comparative literature degree. He moved to Chicago in 2009 and worked as an associate editor for the Chicago branch of the Huffington Post. He later worked as the head writer for the University of Chicago Office of College Admissions.

In 2012, Guzzardi ran for the Illinois House of Representatives, but lost by 125 votes to the incumbent Maria Antonia Berrios, daughter of then Cook Country Democratic Party Chairman, Joseph Berrios. Berrios had the support of the Chicago Democratic establishment behind her, including endorsements from Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle as well as Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan.

In 2014, Guzzardi again ran for the seat in one of the most-followed races in the city that year with the support of progressive groups like the Chicago Teachers Union and other progressive elected officials. Ultimately, Guzzardi defeated Berrios by a 20% margin. Guzzardi's campaigns have focused on issues of social and economic inequality, and opposition to Chicago's machine politics.

As of July 3, 2022, Representative Guzzardi was a member of the following Illinois House committees: Criminal Administration and Enforcement Subcommittee, Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, & IT Committee, Firearms and Firearm Safety Subcommittee (Chairman of), Housing Committee, Judiciary - Criminal Committee, Juvenile Justice and System-Involved Youth Subcommittee (Chairman of), Prescription Drug Affordability, Sentencing, Penalties and Criminal Procedure Subcommittee, Sex Offenses and Sex Offender Registration Subcommittee.

As State Representative, Guzzardi has focused on issues pertaining to labor rights, progressive causes, and assistance for working families. Some of his enacted bills include: SB1 - Raises the minimum wage to $15 an hour in Illinois, SB667 - A measure that caps the cost of insulin co-payments for insurance plans for 260,000 Illinoisans at $100 per month, SB1351 - A student loan bill of rights to protect individuals with student loan debt from predatory lending practices, HB303 - A law that reforms civic asset forfeitures practices by Illinois law enforcement to ensure Illinoisan's property is not taken unjustly.
