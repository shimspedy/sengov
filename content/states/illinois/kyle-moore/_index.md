Kyle Moore is a dedicated public servant who has devoted his life to improving the lives of residents in Quincy and Adams County. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business management from Quincy University and began his career working for his family business, eventually becoming an owner and Vice President. Kyle was also active in local service organizations, including Big Brother/Big Sisters and the United Way of Adams County.

In 2009, Kyle sought to serve his community in an elected capacity and was elected to the Quincy City Council. He was elected Mayor of the City of Quincy in 2013 and was re-elected in 2017. During his tenure as Mayor, Kyle developed many programs that enhanced the economic climate of the region, including Quincy Promise, a privately funded college scholarship program. He worked with the District on the Downtown Rental Rehab Program, which formed public/private partnerships to renovate upper-story buildings downtown into residential units. In 2018, he formed a bi-partisan group of elected officials and community groups to save the Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy, which resulted in the State of Illinois providing $230 million for a new campus. A year later, Kyle offered the “45×30 Plan,” a comprehensive approach to grow Quincy’s population by investing in talent attraction and retention programs, increasing tourism, and modernizing the city’s retail incentives.

Kyle was named President of the Great River Economic Development Foundation in 2021. In that role, he worked with numerous companies on their expansion projects, including the Tri-Mark Corporation, United Alloy, and Amazon. In the 104th General Assembly, Kyle continues to work on expanding job opportunities in communities, improving infrastructure, and protecting families’ and taxpayers’ rights.

Kyle Moore was elected to the Illinois General Assembly in November 2024 to represent the 99th House District, which serves parts of Adams, Brown, Cass, Morgan, and Schuyler counties, including the municipalities of Quincy, Jacksonville/South Jacksonville, Beardstown, Mt. Sterling, and Ashland. He assumed office on January 8, 2025, and his current term ends on January 13, 2027. Kyle is currently engaged to be married. In his spare time, you can find him rooting for his beloved Los Angeles Dodgers.
