Anthony DeLuca is a member of the Democratic Party and has been serving in the Illinois House of Representatives, representing District 80, since 2009. His current term ends on January 8, 2025. He is running for re-election to the Illinois House of Representatives to represent District 80 and is on the ballot in the Democratic primary on March 19, 2024.

Anthony DeLuca graduated from Homewood-Flossmoor high school before attending Elmhurst College. He is the former mayor of Chicago Heights, serving from 2003-2009, when he was then elected to the Illinois General Assembly. His career experience includes being a consultant for Republic Services, the director of operations at Skyline Disposal Company, and being the president of the Bloom Township Board of Education.

In 1975, DeLuca was elected to the city council of Penn Hills, Pennsylvania. The city council elected DeLuca to become the deputy mayor in 1978. DeLuca ran for mayor of Penn Hills against Phyllis Kernick in the election in 1979, but lost the election. DeLuca ran in a special election in March 1980 for Pennsylvania's 32nd Representative District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, seeking to fill the remainder of Kernick's term, which she resigned when becoming mayor. He lost the election to Republican Albert Rasco. In the 1982 general election, DeLuca ran again for the 32nd district in the Pennsylvania House, and he defeated Rasco in a rematch. Rasco challenged DeLuca again in 1984, and DeLuca won reelection. DeLuca won election to the Pennsylvania House for 20 terms. At the time of his death, he was the longest serving member of the Pennsylvania House. He was the top Democratic member on the House Insurance Committee for 20 years. In 2022, DeLuca was reelected posthumously, triggering a special election.

DeLuca was inducted into Westinghouse High School's hall of fame in 1996. DeLuca and his wife, Constance, were married for 66 years until her death in 2021, and they had four children. Their son, Anthony Jr., was elected to serve as mayor of Penn Hills and as a magistrate judge.
