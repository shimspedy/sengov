Jehan A. Gordon-Booth, born in 1981, is a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing the 92nd district since 2009. She is a proud daughter of Peoria and the first African-American woman ever to be elected to represent the central region of the state in the Illinois General Assembly. In January of 2015, she became, again the first African-American woman from Central Illinois to serve the state as Assistant Majority Leader of the House Democratic Party.

Gordon-Booth was born and raised in Peoria County, Illinois, where she attended Limestone High School in Bartonville, and attended Parkland College and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Before she ever served in the House, Rep. Gordon-Booth lived out her platform of making quality education real and accessible through her work. After graduating from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, she served as one of District 69's youngest school board members.

She served on the staff of the Small Business Development Center at Bradley University. She later served as the coordinator of retention efforts at Illinois Central College. In an extension of efforts retaining students at ICC, she chaired Peoria’s Promise, which assists qualified students in applying for scholarships at ICC. She served as an elected member of the Pleasant Hill School District 69 Board of Education.

Gordon-Booth was elected in November 2008 to the seat being vacated by Aaron Schock. She defeated Joan Krupa, but Krupa was appointed to the seat to fill the remaining nine days of Schock's term when Schock became U.S. Representative for Illinois's 18th congressional district. In 2018, J. B. Pritzker appointed Gordon-Booth to the gubernatorial transition's Restorative Justice and Safe Communities Committee.

As of July 3rd, 2022, Representative Gordon-Booth was a member of the following committees: Appropriations - Human Services Committee (HAPH), Appropriations - Public Safety Committee (HAPP), Executive Committee (HEXC), Redistricting Committee (HRED), Restorative Justice Committee (SHRJ), Rules Committee (HRUL), Special Issues (AP) Subcommittee (HAPH-ISSU).

Rep. Gordon-Booth is still a proud resident of Peoria where she lives today with her best friend and husband Coach Derrick Booth and their two year old daughter, Jianna. Among her colleagues Rep. Gordon Booth is regarded as kind, level-headed, and they even dare say “bipartisan.”
