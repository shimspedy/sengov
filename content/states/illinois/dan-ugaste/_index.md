Daniel J. Ugaste is a lawyer, politician, and Republican member of the Illinois House of Representatives for the 65th district. The district, located in the Chicago metropolitan area, includes all or parts of Batavia, Elgin, Geneva, Hampshire, South Elgin, and St. Charles.

Education and Law Career:
The first person in his family to complete college, Ugaste earned a Bachelor of Arts at Lake Forest College and a juris doctor at DePaul University College of Law. In the 1990's, Ugaste was an attorney for Seyfarth Shaw, Limited Liability Partnership and Wiedner & McAuliffe, Limited Company. Ugaste is a shareholder in the Nyhan, Bambrick, Kinzie and Lowry Law Firm and specializes in workers' compensation. He worked as a member of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Medical Fee Advisory Board and as a technical advisor to Bruce Rauner's Office on Workers' Compensation Reform.

Illinois House of Representatives:
In 2018, Ugaste was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, defeating Democratic candidate Richard Johnson - the President of the Elgin Teachers Union. He succeeded retiring incumbent Steven Andersson. In 2020, he was re-elected, narrowly defeating activist Martha Paschke. Ugaste won a third term in 2022, against scientist and small business owner Linda Robertson. Ugaste's former campaign committee chairman endorsed Robertson over Ugaste in the race, saying that Robertson had "made it clear that she will protect our rights to make personal decisions and live without excessive government interference," and that Robertson was the "better candidate."

Committees:
In the 102nd Illinois General Assembly, Ugaste served on the House Committees on Energy & Environment; Judiciary; Labor & Commerce; Police & Fire; and the subcommittees on Civil Procedure & Tort Liability; Roadways, Rail, & Aviation; and Workforce Development.

Ugaste has consistently voted against protections for workers and LGBTQ people, abortion access, and criminal justice and gun control reforms. He voted against prohibiting housing discrimination based on one's source of income, did not vote on a bill prohibiting the sale of and possession of homemade firearms, voted against a resolution supporting reproductive rights, voted against safeguards for older LGBTQ+ people, voted against requiring employers to provide each employee at least 24 consecutive hours of rest for every 7 day period, voted against prohibiting schools from denying a student their transcript because of unpaid debt, voted against expanding protections for victims of domestic violence in the workplace, and did not vote on a bill allowing school district employees fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to take paid sick days without repercussion if they or their child have COVID-19.
