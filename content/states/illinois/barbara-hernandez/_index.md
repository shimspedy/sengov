Barbara Hernandez is a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives from the 50th district. The district, located in the Chicago metropolitan area, includes portions of Aurora, North Aurora, and Batavia.

In the House, Hernandez represented the 83rd District from 2019 to 2023. After new legislative maps were drawn to fit new census data, she won re-election to the House from the 50th District. Prior to her appointment to the House, she was a member of the Kane County Board.

In 2019, Hernandez was appointed by the Democratic Representative Committee for the 83rd Representative District to fill the vacancy of the 83rd House District, which was left by Linda Chapa LaVia after her appointment to be Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs. Hernandez was sworn into office by Judge Michael Noland on March 7, 2019. She became the youngest member of the General Assembly.

Hernandez won a first full term representing the 83rd District in 2020, defeating Republican Donald Walter. She again defeated Walter for a third term in 2022, with both running in the redrawn 50th District. In 2023, House Speaker Chris Welch named Hernandez an Assistant Majority Leader.

During the 102nd General Assembly, Hernandez was the Vice-Chairperson of the City and Villages Committee. She also sat on the House Committees for Energy and Environment; Appropriations - Higher Education; Housing; International Trade and Commerce; and the subcommittees for Local Government and Clean Energy.

Barbara Hernandez graduated from East Aurora High School in 2010. Hernandez earned an associate degree in political science and government from Waubonsee Community College in 2012, a bachelor's degree in political science from Aurora University in 2014, and a master's degree in public administration from Aurora University in 2021. Her career experience includes working as the assistant chief of staff to former Illinois State Representative Linda Chapa LaVia, a residential counselor with the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, and a team captain with Family Focus, Inc.
