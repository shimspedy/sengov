Bradley A. Stephens is a Republican Party politician currently serving as state representative from the 20th district within the Illinois General Assembly and the village president (mayor) of Rosemont, Illinois.

Stephens was appointed to his seat in the Illinois House of Representatives on June 29, 2019, to replace Michael P. McAuliffe, and won election to a full term in the Illinois House of Representatives in 2020. His current term ends on January 8, 2025. He is running for re-election to the Illinois House of Representatives to represent District 20 and is on the ballot in the Republican primary on March 19, 2024.

Before his political career, Stephens served the Village of Rosemont as a member of its Board of Trustees. He has also served as a member of the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority board of directors, the Leyden Township supervisor (an elected position), a member of the Pace board of directors, and a Rosemont village trustee (an elected position). Stephens is the Leyden Township Republican Party committeeperson, an elected party position.

Stephens was born on February 5, 1963. His family is highly influential in Rosemont, Illinois' government. Stephens' father Donald Stephens was a founder of the village, and, until his death in 2007, served as its first village president. As of 2010, the Stephens family had ten family members on the village's payroll, cumulatively earning nearly $1 million in annual salary. At that time, five members of his family were elected officials in the city. Stephens' mother was Estelle “Pat” Stephens (née Patronski). She died in 2019.

In 1989, Stephens became a Rosemont village trustee, an elected position. He would continue to hold this position for 18 years, until he was appointed mayor in 2007. Stephens also served as Leyden Township supervisor, an elected position. He would hold this position, before resigning from it in 2013. Stephens has served as the Leyden Township Republican Party committeeperson, an elected party position. He has won election to this position every four years since 2006 by a vote of those participating in the Republican primaries.

Stephens was appointed village president of Rosemont by the Village of Rosemont Board of Trustees on May 1, 2007, two weeks after his father, Donald Stephens, died in office. He was sworn in on May 6. He was elected to a full term in 2009, and has been reelected as village president in 2013, 2017, and 2021.
