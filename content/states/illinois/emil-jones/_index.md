Emil Jones Jr. was born on October 18, 1935, in Chicago, Illinois. He is an American politician who served as the President of the Illinois Senate from 2003 to 2009. As a member of the Democratic party, Jones served in the Illinois Senate from 1983 to 2009. Prior to his term in the Senate, he was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1973 until 1983.

Education:
Jones completed his early education at Chicago's Tilden Technical High School, graduating in 1953. He then earned an Associate in Arts degree from the Loop Junior College (now Harold Washington College). Following this, he attended Roosevelt University, where he majored in Business Administration. In 2004, Roosevelt University awarded Jones a Doctorate of Humane Letters Honoris Causa Degree. He also received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Chicago State University.

Early Political Career:
Jones began his political career working for John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election. Seven years later, he went to work as an alderman's assistant. His career included 30 years on the city payroll, 20 with the Sewer Department, where he retired as an inspector in 1993.

Legislative Career:
Jones began his elected career in 1973, when he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. He served in that capacity from 1973 to 1983. During that time he served as the Chairman of the Insurance Committee and was an Assistant Democratic Leader. In 1982 he was elected to the Illinois Senate. In addition to being the president of the Senate, he also served as a member of the Executive Committee. He lost Democratic primary bids for a congressional seat in 1988 and 1995.

Jones had a significant role in Barack Obamaâ€™s 2004 U.S. Senate win by introducing the then little-known liberal state senator to the right people and letting him handle some important legislation to help raise his political profile. In 2008, Jones initially refused to call the Senate into session to vote on ethics legislation that had passed the House. However, after Obama urged Jones to change his mind, Jones released a statement saying he would call the Senate into session.
