Tony McCombie is an American realtor, politician, and the Republican Minority Leader of the Illinois House of Representatives. She represents the 89th district, which consists of all or parts of Carroll, DeKalb, Jo Daviess, Ogle, Stephenson, Winnebago counties in northwestern Illinois.

Before her political career, McCombie was a small business owner, operating Blue Appraisals, and worked as a real estate broker with Mel Foster Company. She served as a City Alderperson and Mayor for the City of Savanna, Illinois.

McCombie first ran for the 71st District seat in the Illinois House of Representatives in 2016. After an uncontested Republican primary, McCombie faced off against incumbent Democratic nominee Mike Smiddy in the 2016 general election. In the election, McCombie defeated Smiddy with 63% of the vote. McCombie won re-election to the seat in 2018, 2020, and 2022.

On November 15, 2022, McCombie was elected to succeed Jim Durkin as Illinois House Minority Leader. Durkin had stepped down after leading the Republican Party through the 2022 Illinois House of Representatives election, which saw the party lose a number of seats in the chamber. McCombie became House Minority Leader on January 11, 2023. She is the first woman to lead the House Republican caucus.

As a legislator, McCombie is focused on job creation, property tax relief, and improved government accountability. She has been the primary sponsor on several bills that have gone on to become law in Illinois. This includes HB1927, which created the Experimental Aircraft Association Fund as a special fund in the state treasury, and HB1928, which allowed the issuance of Child Abuse Council of the Quad Cities special license plate decals by the Illinois Department of Human Services.

As of 2022, McCombie serves on five committees and four subcommittees: Restorative Justice committee (Republican Spokesperson), Public Utilities committee, Judiciary - Criminal committee, Insurance committee, Elementary & Secondary Education: School Curriculum & Policies committee, Juvenile Justice and System Involved Youth subcommittee, Criminal Administration and Enforcement subcommittee.
