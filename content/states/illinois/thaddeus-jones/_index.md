Thaddeus Jones is an American politician who is currently serving as both the Illinois state representative for the 29th district and as the mayor of Calumet City, Illinois. The 29th district includes all or parts of Chicago, Dolton, South Holland, Lansing, Calumet City, Thornton, Glenwood, Sauk Village, Steger, Crete, and Monee. Jones is a member of the Democratic Party.

Jones' first position in elective office was as Calumet City's 3rd ward alderman from 1997 to 2007. His first year in statewide office began in 2011, after beating primary opponent Sheryl Tillman for the 29th district seat by 24 points, and Green Party candidate Kenny Williams by 66 points in the 2010 Illinois General election.

In 2017, Jones resigned from his role with his eponymous Jones Foundation for using charitable donations for campaign finance purposes. In 2021, Jones become the first Black mayor of Calumet City, after beating 18-year incumbent mayor Michelle Markiewicz Qualkinbush. The election was fiercely-contested, with both sides alleging foul play against each other. Jones' victory and inauguration were subject to judicial challenge which initially overturned the results, but this judgment was eventually appealed and affirmed in the Supreme Court of Illinois. Jones beat a write-in candidate Tony Quiroz on April 6, and will simultaneously hold the 29th district Illinois statehouse seat while acting as Calumet City mayor. He was sworn in May 1, 2021.

As of July 3, 2022, Representative Jones is a member of the following Illinois House committees: Family Law & Probate Subcommittee (Chairman of), Insurance Committee, Judiciary - Civil Committee, Labor & Commerce Committee, Minority Impact Analysis Subcommittee, Prescription Drug Affordability Committee (Co-chairman of), Special Issues (INS) Subcommittee, Workforce Development Subcommittee.

According to his official website, Jones has two sons, and lives with his wife Saprina in Calumet City.
