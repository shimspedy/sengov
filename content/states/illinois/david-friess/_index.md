David Friess is a Republican member of the Illinois House from the 115th district since January 13, 2021. Friess was born in Southern Illinois and grew up in Chester. He attended and graduated from Chester High School. Immediately after graduating, Friess joined the United States Air Force as an aircraft mechanic. After completing his active duty obligation, he joined the Air Force Reserves as a flight engineer and crew chief of the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter and stationed in Charleston, South Carolina. During his time in the reserves, he served in the Gulf War.

After retiring from the Air Force, Friess worked for Delta Air Lines in Atlanta briefly as an aircraft mechanic. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice from Mercer University and earned his Juris Doctor from Atlanta's John Marshall Law School. He is a member of the Randolph County Bar Association.

As of July 3, 2022, Representative Friess is a member of the following Illinois House committees: Appropriations - Public Safety Committee (HAPP), Elementary & Secondary Education: School Curriculum & Policies Committee (HELM), Judiciary - Criminal Committee (HJUC), Natural Gas Subcommittee (HPUB-NGAS), Public Utilities Committee (HPUB), State Government Administration Committee (HSGA).

In 2018, Friess first ran for the 116th district in the 2018 Illinois House of Representatives election. He ran unopposed in the primary and in the general election ran against Democratic then-incumbent Jerry Costello II. He lost in the general election by an 8-point margin.

In 2019, Friess' previous opponent Costello was appointed by Governor J. B. Pritzker as director of law enforcement for the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Democrat Nathan Reitz, son of Dan Reitz (the state Representative of the district before Costello), was appointed to fill Costello's remaining term.
