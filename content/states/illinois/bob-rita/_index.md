Robert "Bob" Rita was born on October 2, 1969. He is a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives for the 28th District since January 8, 2003. Rita is also the Calumet Township Democratic committeeman and a trustee on the township board. His state representative district includes parts of Chicago's 9th and 34th wards, as well as several suburbs.

Rita lists economic redevelopment, equitable school funding, and increased health care availability as his top priorities in the state legislature. He is an Operating Engineer and a member of Local #150. He has been re-elected four times and was unopposed in the 2008 general election.

In the February 5, 2008 Democratic primary, his opponent, Earick Rayburn, was backed by William Dugan - then-head of Operating Engineers Union Local 150. The union contributed nearly $100,000 to Rayburn's campaign. Rita defeated Rayburn by a margin of more than 3-to-1 in the primary, and received about 60% of the vote in a five-candidate race.

As of July 3, 2022, Representative Rita is a member of the following Illinois House committees: Cities & Villages Committee (HCIV), Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, & IT Committee (HCDA), Ethics & Elections Committee (SHEE) (Chairman of), Executive Committee (HEXC), Prescription Drug Affordability Committee (HPDA), Revenue & Finance Committee (HREF) (Chairman of), Sales, Amusements, and Other Taxes Subcommittee (HREF-SATX).

Rita comes from a family dedicated to public service and is the father of one daughter, Ashley.
