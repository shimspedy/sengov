Natalie Toro is a Democratic member of the Illinois Senate, representing the 20th district. She was sworn into office on July 10, 2023, following her appointment to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Cristina Pacione-Zayas.

Before her political career, Toro was a dedicated educator, serving as a kindergarten and third-grade teacher for nearly a decade in the Chicago Public Schools system. Her experience in education has undoubtedly shaped her legislative priorities and approach to public service.

Toro's appointment to the Illinois Senate was facilitated by the Cook County Democratic Party. Her tenure in the Senate has been marked by her commitment to her constituents in the 20th district and her dedication to the principles of the Democratic Party.

In addition to her role as a state legislator, Toro is also a lifelong resident of the 20th Senate District. Her deep roots in the community she serves have given her a unique understanding of the needs and concerns of her constituents.

As a member of the Illinois Senate, Toro serves on several committees, including Appropriations for Education, Early Childhood Education, Education, Health and Human Services, and Local Government. She is the Vice-Chair of the Local Government committee.

Toro's political journey continues as she is running in a special election for the Illinois State Senate to represent District 20. The special Democratic primary is scheduled for March 19, 2024. Her opponents in the primary are CTU organizer Graciela Guzman, doctor Dave Nayak, and community organizer Geary Yonker.

Despite the challenges of political life, Toro remains committed to serving her community and making a difference in the lives of the people in the 20th district. Her story is a testament to the power of public service and the impact that dedicated individuals can have on their communities.
