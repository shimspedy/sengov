Chris G. Miller, born on June 15, 1954, is an American politician who represents the 101st district in the Illinois House of Representatives. Miller was born in Oakland, Illinois. He earned an associate degree from Lincoln Land Community College and a Bachelor of Science in education from Eureka College.

Miller is the owner of a large farm in northern Coles County. He is a member of the Republican Party. Miller is part of a group of Downstate Illinois Republicans who have pushed efforts to separate Chicago from the rest of the state, contending it has too much influence over the region's legislation and culture.

On January 6, 2021, Miller attended a Save America Rally before Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In a video posted to his public Facebook page, Miller railed against "dangerous Democrat terrorists" and said "weâ€™re in a great cultural war to see which worldview will survive." During the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, Miller's truck was in a restricted area next to the Capitol. It bore a decal of the logo of the extremist Three Percenters group, which later had five of its members charged with crimes associated with the attack, including trespass and assaulting police officers.

On March 1, 2021, nearly three dozen members of the Illinois House of Representatives, including Speaker of the House Chris Welch, co-sponsored House Resolution 132 to "condemn" Miller's actions at the January 6 rally that preceded the riot at the U.S. Capitol. The resolution also references a complaint filed March 1 with the Illinois Legislative Inspector General to investigate Miller's actions on January 6. On March 18, 2021, the Illinois House voted to censure Miller for attending the Save America rally that preceded Trump supporters' insurrection at the Capitol. The resolution by Illinois State Representative Bob Morgan alleged Miller's words and actions violated his oath of office and "created an environment that potentially threatens not only the sanctity of the Illinois General Assembly but also the safety of the members and their staff".

Miller is married to U.S. Rep. Mary Miller, elected in 2020 to represent Illinois's 15th Congressional District. They have been married for over 37 years and have seven children and 14 grandchildren.
