Fred Crespo is a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing the 44th district since 2007. This district lies entirely within Cook County and includes all of Streamwood, approximately half of Hoffman Estates and Hanover Park, and portions of Schaumburg, Elgin, and Bartlett.

Crespo attended Loyola University, Chicago. He has been a member of the following Legislative Committees: Appropriations for General Services (Chair), Education Policy (Chair), Elementary and Secondary Education (Vice Chair), Mass Transit (Member), Public Utilities (Member), Small Business Empowerment and Workforce Development (Member), Subcommittee on Mandates (Member), and Tourism and Conventions (Member).

Crespo has made significant contributions to his community. He provided assistance for the construction of the much-needed Alexian Brothers Women's and Children's Hospital in the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago. Crespo worked with the Village of Hoffman Estates to secure funding for a full interchange at Interstate 90 and Barrington Road which, when completed in 2016, improved both economic opportunities for the area as well as life-safety conditions for the region. Crespo worked collaboratively with the Village of Hanover Park, Harper Community College, and Elgin Community College to open the Work and Education Center in Hanover Park in 2014.

In 2018, then-Governor-elect J. B. Pritzker appointed Crespo to the Educational Success transition committee, which is responsible for state education policy.

Crespo has also had a successful electoral history. He has won multiple elections for the Illinois 44th State House District General Election, consistently securing a majority of the votes.
