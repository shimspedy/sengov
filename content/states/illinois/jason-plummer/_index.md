Jason Plummer, born Robert Jason Plummer on June 4, 1982, is an American businessman and politician. He is currently serving as a Republican member of the Illinois Senate and holds the position of Assistant Leader in the Illinois Republican Senate Caucus.

Born in Chesterfield, Missouri, Plummer's family resided in Staunton, Illinois at his birth and later moved to Glen Carbon, Illinois. He lived in Glen Carbon and Edwardsville, Illinois, where he graduated from Edwardsville High School. He then attended the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, graduating with a B.S. in finance. At the University of Illinois, Plummer was active in several organizations including the Army ROTC Fighting Illini Battalion. After college, he interned at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC. He commissioned as an Intelligence Officer in the United States Navy Reserves after college.

At age 25, Plummer was elected Chairman of the Madison County Republican Party, the minority party in a historic stronghold for the Democratic Party of Illinois. The youngest party chairman in Illinois at the time, he was elected on a platform of combating local corruption and rebuilding the local GOP in one of the largest counties in the state by population. Since Plummer's election, the Madison County Republican Party has made significant gains, winning numerous county-wide offices and taking majority control of the county board for the first time in history.

During the 2008 Republican Party presidential primaries, Plummer ran to be a delegate to the 2008 Republican National Convention from Illinois's 19th congressional district for the presidential campaign of former Governor Mitt Romney. Plummer was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 2010. Plummer won the primary and was paired with the winner of the Republican gubernatorial primary, State Senator Bill Brady, for the general election.

Plummer and his family live in Edwardsville where he serves as vice president of R.P. Lumber, a family owned and operated business with over eighty locations throughout Illinois and four other states. Sen. Plummer is also active in other businesses spanning multiple industries, including real estate, banking, hospitality, manufacturing, and agriculture. He also enjoys participating in numerous civic organizations and non-profits.

Senator Plummer was elected to serve as the state Senator for the 54th Senate District in 2018 and re-elected in 2022, now representing the 55th Senate District following redistricting. The 55th State Senate District encompasses all or portions of Bond, Clay, Clinton, Effingham, Fayette, Madison, Marion, Montgomery, Richland, St. Clair, and Washington Counties. It stretches from Edwardsville to Olney, covering suburbs of St. Louis and historic rural communities, including Vandalia, Illinoisâ€™ previous capitol city. The 55th District is home to over 200,000 people.

Senator Plummer was named as Assistant Republican Leader for the Illinois Senate Republican Caucus Leadership Team for the 102nd General Assembly, beginning in 2021, and again for the 103rd General Assembly, beginning in 2023. He also serves as the Minority Spokesperson for the Senate Financial Institutions Committee, as well the Minority Spokesperson for the Executive Appointments Committee. Plummer will also serve as a member of the Health & Human Services, Human Rights, and Labor Committees during the current General Assembly.
