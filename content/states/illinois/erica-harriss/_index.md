During her time on the Board, she served as the Chairperson of the Personnel Committee and was also a member of the Finance, Government Operations, and Grants committees. Her guiding principle as a county board member was to put the taxpayer, the parent, and the resident first, and she worked diligently to promote fiscal responsibility, while maintaining high-quality services, infrastructure, and government accountability. Now she continues to promote those priorities at the state level.

In addition to her current work in the Senate, Erica is also an entrepreneur and small business owner. Prior to opening her business in 2014, she worked in the marketing/communication field. In her free time, Erica volunteers in her community at various local charity organizations and is an active member and youth group leader at Metro Community Church.

Erica is a proud Tiger Alum graduating from Edwardsville High School before earning her college degree in Speech Communication/Public Relations from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 1999. Erica and her husband, Jeff, reside in Glen Carbon and have three children.

Harriss currently serves on the following committees: Approp- Health and Human; Energy and Public Utilities; Higher Education; Local Government (Minority Spokesperson); Veterans Affairs; Special Committee on Pensions.

Born in Highland, Erica grew up, went to school, started her family and founded her own small business right here in Madison County.
