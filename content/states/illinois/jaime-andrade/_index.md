Jaime M. Andrade Jr. is the State Representative for Illinois' 40th District. He has served as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives since 2013. During his tenure, he has prioritized legislation that keeps pace with technology, protects the environment, and improves community safety.

He won his first election in 2014, and was re-elected as a Democrat in 2016, 2018, and 2020. He acts in leadership as Assistant House Majority Leader. Andrade's current district is located on the northwest side of Chicago and includes Avondale, Irving Park, and Albany Park. The legislative remap following the 2020 Census will incorporate parts of North Center, Roscoe Village, and West Lakeview into Andrade's district.

A long-time community leader and resident of the Irving Park neighborhood, Andrade has been praised for his community clean up efforts, making headlines when local pigeons took issue with his push for funds to clean up the local Blue Line (CTA) station. From 1998 until his appointment to the General Assembly he was an assistant to former Chicago alderman Richard Mell; he was also a Legislative Assistant and Assistant Sergeant-At-Arms for the Chicago City Council.

As creator and former chair of the Cybersecurity, Data Analytics & IT Committee, Andrade wrote the first-of-its-kind legislation regulating the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Illinois. The Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act regulates Illinois employersâ€™ use of AI in the interview and hiring process.

Andrade is the founder and former Chairperson of the Cybersecurity, Data Analytics & IT Committee for the IL House of Representatives and is presently a member of the following committees and subcommittees: Appropriations-General Services, Cybersecurity, Data Analytics & IT Committee, Executive, Financial Institutions, Human Services, Labor & Commerce, Public Benefits Subcommittee, Small Business, Technology, and Innovation, Wage Policy & Study Subcommittee.

Andrade has focused on crafting pro-active legislation that keeps Illinois up-to-date with the latest technological advances, protects the environment, and bolsters Illinois' fiscal health. He passed the first of its kind law banning the manufacture and sale of personal care products containing harmful plastic microbeads, a version of which was later signed into federal law by President Barack Obama. In 2021, he carried the Automatic Renewal Contract Act to make cancelling subscriptions easier for online consumers, which later became law. That same year, he also carried the Illinois Sick Leave Act for Aviation Workers in the House.
