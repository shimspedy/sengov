Brad Halbrook is a Republican member of the Illinois General Assembly. He was born on July 22, 1961, in Pana, Illinois, U.S. Before joining the general assembly, he was a small business owner who ran a company making fences.

Halbrook's political career began in April 2012 when he was appointed to the state legislature to fill out the term of retiring state legislator Roger L. Eddy. He served as a State Representative in the 110th District from 2012 until 2015. He did not run for re-election in 2014 and was succeeded by Reggie Phillips. However, he returned to the Illinois House after the 2016 elections and is now serving in the 107th District.

Halbrook is both socially and fiscally conservative. He supports lowering taxes and increasing the number of Illinois jobs. In 2012, he became just the 10th State Legislator to turn down the underfunded and overly generous General Assembly Retirement System pension. He was among a group of legislators that started a trend; as of October 2016, 33 legislators turn down the pension.

During his campaign, Halbrook advocated for lower taxes. In the past, he has spoken out against local and state tax increases. He supports property tax caps and opposes income tax increases. Because of the number of people and jobs that have left Illinois, Halbrook says that he is committed to reforming worker's compensation laws by eliminating unnecessary regulations.

Halbrook opposes abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control. He was one of five Illinois representatives to vote against the Illinois Right to Vote Amendment on its passage in the Illinois House of Representatives. The bill subsequently was passed unanimously in the Illinois Senate, and was approved as a constitutional amendment by the voters of Illinois.

During his time as a state legislator, he voted in favor of bills to provide transparency for local governments. He supports redistricting reform and imposing term limits on state legislators. Halbrook was the fifth legislator to not accept the General Assembly pension benefit for himself. He has said that he work to reform the state pension system.

In February 2021, Halbrook introduced a measure calling for Chicago to become its own state. The measure received no co-sponsors in the state House.

As of July 3, 2022, Representative Halbrook is a member of the following Illinois House committees: Appropriations - General Service Committee (HAPG), Cities & Villages Committee (HCIV), Counties & Townships Committee (HCOT), Housing Committee (SHOU).
