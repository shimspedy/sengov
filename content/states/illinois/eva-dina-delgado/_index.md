Eva-Dina Delgado is a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives for the 3rd district. The 3rd district, located in the Chicago area, includes parts of Elmwood Park, as well as all or parts of the Chicago neighborhoods of Austin, Belmont Cragin, Dunning, Hermosa, Logan Square, Montclare, and Portage Park.

Delgado was appointed to the seat after the resignation of former Illinois state representative Luis Arroyo. Arroyo resigned as the result of an indictment of federal program bribery. Her appointment came under contentious fire from then-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan after proxy votes from former representative Arroyo were used to select Delgado as his replacement.

As of July 2, 2022, Representative Delgado is a member of the following committees: Appropriations - Public Safety Committee (HAPP), Consumer Protection Committee (HCON), Elementary & Secondary Education: Administration, Licensing & Charter Schools Committee, Financial Protection Subcommittee (HCON-FINA), Natural Gas Subcommittee (HPUB-NGAS), Public Utilities Committee (HPUB), and Transportation: Vehicles & Safety Committee (HVES).

In the electoral history, Delgado has shown strong performance. In the Illinois 3rd Representative District Democratic Primary, 2020, she won with 51.55% of the votes. In the General Election of the same year, she secured 100% of the votes. In the General Election of 2022, she won with 81.95% of the votes.

Delgado holds a Juris Doctor from DePaul University College of Law and a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Relations from Wellesley College. She is an active member of the Illinois Legislative Latino Caucus and the House Democratic Women’s Caucus. She also serves as a board member of the Illinois Legislative Latino Caucus Foundation.

She has been recognized as a “Rising Star” by the Women’s Energy Summit in 2016 and was listed in Who’s Who in Latino Business by Negocios Now in 2019. She previously served on boards of Lawyers Lend-a-Hand to Youth, Saint Anthony Hospital, and Instituto del Progreso Latino.

Delgado resides in the Logan Square neighborhood in Chicago along with her husband and daughter.
