Terri Bryant is a dedicated public servant and a Republican member of the Illinois Senate from the 58th district. She was born on September 20, 1963. She first took the oath of office as Illinois' 58th district State Senator on January 13, 2021. After her re-election in 2022, Terri was sworn-in to office once again in January 2023 for a two-year term.

Before her tenure in the Senate, she was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives representing the 115th district from 2015 until 2021. She took office two weeks earlier than the majority of the 2015 freshman class when her predecessor Mike Bost resigned early in order to take office in Congress. The 115th district, located in Southern Illinois, includes Jefferson, Washington, Perry, Jackson and Union counties.

Senator Bryant's commitment to public service began in 1994 at the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC). After 20 years of service, she retired from the IDOC in 2014. While working in the IDOC, Senator Bryant rose to the rank of Public Service Administrator at the Pinckneyville Correctional Center and the DuQuoin Impact Incarceration Program. In addition to her normal duties over the Dietary Department, Bryant served as a member of the Illinois Department of Corrections Religious Practices Advisory Board, and as both an internal and an external auditor.

Throughout the years, Senator Bryant remained dedicated to political pursuits, including serving as a Precinct Committee Woman, Vice-President of the Jackson County Republican Womenâ€™s Club and as Second Vice-Chair of the Jackson County Republican Central Committee. She was also a delegate to the Illinois Republican Conventions in 2008 and again in 2012. At the 2008 Illinois Republican Convention Bryant was selected as a Presidential Elector, and at the 2012 Convention she served on the committee to appoint at-large delegates to the National Convention. In 2009, Terri graduated from the Illinois Lincoln Excellence in Public Service Series. She was appointed to the Board of Governors for that organization in 2010 and was elected President in 2011.

Outside of politics, Bryant has experience in the farming and service industries, including owning a successful Bluebell Restaurant in Murphysboro, Illinois. She balances her duties as a State Senator with her responsibilities in the private sector.

Senator Bryant serves as the Minority Spokesperson for the Energy and Public Utilities and the Behavioral and Mental Health committee as well as a member of the Agriculture, Appropriations-Education, Behavioral, and Education committees. Senator Bryant serves as a member of the Senate Higher Education Working Group and the Commission on Equitable Public University Funding.

Terri Bryant resides in Murphysboro with her husband Rick and have been married since 1981. They have one son Tyler (Elaina) Bryant, one Daughter Tara (Tyler) Heinzmann, and 6 grandchildren.
