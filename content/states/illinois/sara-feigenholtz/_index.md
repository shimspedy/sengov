Sara Feigenholtz is a dedicated and influential member of the Illinois Senate, representing the 6th District. Born on December 11, 1956, in Chicago, Illinois, she has been a lifelong advocate for progressive causes, reflecting her personal experiences and family background.

Before joining the Illinois Senate in January 2020, Feigenholtz served in the House of Representatives, representing Lakeview, Lincoln Park, and near north neighborhoods. Her move to the Senate was marked by a clear focus on housing affordability, neighborhood safety, and quality public education. She now represents the district that includes North Center, Roscoe Village, Ravenswood Manor, Bucktown, and Albany Park neighborhoods.

Feigenholtz has championed groundbreaking legislation reflecting the diverse needs of the district. Her work on health care access, AIDS funding, mental health equity, environmental protection, and modernization of the hospitality industry has earned her a statewide reputation as an effective and energetic leader.

An adoptee herself, Feigenholtz’s personal connection drove her to establish the first committee on Adoption & Child Welfare to shed light on a broken system. The committee has been a catalyst for reform, passing numerous laws to better protect Illinois children.

Raised by a physician, Feigenholtz led the fight to pass the Affordable Care Act expanding Medicaid to insure 800,000 formerly uninsured Illinoisians. She authored the contraceptive equity act which required insurance to cover the cost of contraception, expanded access to mammograms and cervical cancer screenings and treatment.

Feigenholtz sits on many boards in an advisory capacity. She is a founding member and Vice President of the Kennedy Forum, a national organization based in Illinois to combat the stigma of mental illness and achieve mental health parity in the state and country.

A resident of Lakeview and a lifelong Cubs fan, Feigenholtz can be found at the district’s street fairs, community theatres, and music venues when session is adjourned.
