Amy "Murri" Briel is a dedicated public servant representing the 76th District in the Illinois House of Representatives. Born and raised in the Illinois Valley, Murri grew up in a family that valued hard work, community involvement, and social justice. Her father, a Korean War veteran and retired IBEW electrician, instilled in her a deep respect for labor rights and community service. Her mother, a farm girl from a family that immigrated from Ireland nearly 200 years ago, taught her the importance of resilience and dedication to community causes.

Murri attended Wallace Grade School and Ottawa High School, where she was actively involved in the arts, music, speech, and athletics. She went on to study at Illinois State University, majoring in Philosophy and Psychology with minors in Women's Studies and Political Science. During her time at ISU, she competed on the Forensics team, honing her skills in public speaking and debate.

After college, Murri moved to Lisle, Illinois, where she built a career in human resources, recruiting, and human management software. She later transitioned to social services and non-profits, focusing on helping those in need. Murri and her husband, whom she met in Lisle, have three sons, all of whom are autistic and have severe asthma. The lack of specialized medical care and developmental programs in the Illinois Valley prevented the family from moving back to her hometown for many years.

Despite these challenges, Murri remained committed to her community. She ran for Congress in the 2018 primary for Illinois' 16th Congressional District. Although she did not win, she continued to stay active in the Democratic Party, serving as a precinct committeewoman and working on various campaigns and community initiatives. Her dedication to public service eventually led her to run for the Illinois House of Representatives, where she now serves the 76th District.

In her role as a state representative, Murri focuses on issues such as rural community growth, childcare access, environmental protection, and mental healthcare. She is passionate about making a positive impact on her community and ensuring that all residents have access to the resources and support they need to thrive. Whether at home in the Illinois Valley or in Springfield, Murri is committed to fighting for the people of her district and making a difference in their lives.
