Gregg Johnson is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Democratic Party. He represents the 72nd District in the Illinois House of Representatives. His tenure began in January 2023 and he is currently serving his term.

Born and raised in a blue-collar union family in Rock Island County, Gregg's father was a lifelong UAW member who spent years working at Farmall. The closure of Farmall had a significant impact on the community, including Gregg's own career plans.

After graduating from high school, Gregg began his career with the Illinois Department of Corrections at the age of 19. He started as a corrections officer and eventually rose to the position of supervisor. During his 32-year career, Gregg was an active union member and leader, working tirelessly to ensure the safety of his coworkers and the community.

In addition to his professional responsibilities, Gregg served as the president of his AFSCME local. His leadership and commitment to his colleagues are a testament to his dedication to public service and community development.

Gregg lives in East Moline with his wife, Celia, and their youngest daughter, Gabby. As a father, a grandfather, and a husband, Gregg is deeply committed to creating economic opportunities for families to thrive.

In his role as a representative, Gregg serves on several committees, including Elem Sec Ed: School Curric Policies; Labor & Commerce; Mental Health & Addiction; Prescription Drug Affordability; Trans: Regulations, Roads & Bridges; Veterans' Affairs; and Business & Industry Innovation.

Gregg's work in the Illinois House of Representatives is driven by his desire to serve his community and create a better future for the residents of the 72nd District. His experiences, both personal and professional, inform his approach to governance and public service.
