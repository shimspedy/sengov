Bradley J. Fritts, born on January 8, 2000, is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He represents the 74th district in the Illinois House of Representatives, which encompasses all or parts of DeKalb, LaSalle, Lee, Ogle, and Whiteside counties in north-central Illinois. He assumed office on January 11, 2023.

Brad is a lifelong Illinoisan who lives in Dixon. He graduated from Newman Central Catholic High School in Sterling, IL in 2018. He then attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in agricultural and consumer economics in 2021.

In addition to his political career, Brad is also a farmer and a substitute teacher. He comes from a politically active family; his father Edward Fritts is the township supervisor for Dixon Township and his late uncle John Fritts was the Lee County Treasurer.

In the 2022 Republican primary, Brad defeated Liandro Arellano, the incumbent Mayor of Dixon, and ran unopposed in the general election. He is currently running for re-election to the Illinois House of Representatives to represent District 74. He is on the ballot in the Republican primary on March 19, 2024.

Bradley J. Fritts is not only a dedicated public servant but also a trailblazer. In 2022, he became the youngest legislator ever elected to the Illinois General Assembly at only 22 years old. In his first year, he passed four bipartisan bills through the Illinois House of Representatives, demonstrating his commitment to serving his constituents and making a positive impact on his community.
