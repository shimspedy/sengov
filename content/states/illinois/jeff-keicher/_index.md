Jeff Keicher is a Republican member of the Illinois House of Representatives who represents the 70th district. The 70th district includes parts of DeKalb County, Kane and Boone counties. He was appointed to the Illinois House of Representatives in July 2018 to replace outgoing Representative Robert W. Pritchard after the latter's appointment to the Northern Illinois University Board of Trustees.

Keicher is an insurance agent by trade and resides in Sycamore, Illinois. He has a Political Science degree from Northern Illinois University. He has served as the Past President of the Sycamore Rotary Club, and as a Past Board Member of the Kishwaukee YMCA and the DeKalb County American Red Cross. He is married to Karen and they have three children.

In his role as a state representative, Keicher has earned a reputation as a bipartisan problem-solver. His accomplishments include the passage of a new law in 2019 to broaden the availability of mammogram screening, enacting a package of economic reforms in 2019 that contributed to the creation of thousands of good-paying local jobs including DeKalb landing the new Ferrara distribution center and Facebook data center, and three new laws passed in 2021 to better protect victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.

Keicher has also served on the Make Sexual Abuse Fully Extinct (Make S.A.F.E.) Task Force from 2019-2020, which issued a report containing 21 specific recommendations to better protect students. Many of those recommendations have gone on to become law in Illinois. More recently, Representative Keicher served on the Commission on Poverty Elimination and Economic Security, which has drafted a plan to eradicate poverty in Illinois within 15 years working closely with local stakeholders and community leaders throughout the state.

In 2022, Representative Keicher played a key role in passing legislation to extend treatment services to survivors of sexual assault, improve local government efficiency and accountability to the taxpayer, protect restaurants from bad-faith delivery services, and ensure nursing home visitation rights during public health emergencies. As a leading advocate for restoring public trust in state government and rooting out corruption in Illinois, Representative Keicher was appointed to the bicameral, bipartisan Legislative Ethics Commission in January 2022 where he continues to push for meaningful ethics reform and holding lawmakers accountable.
