Kimberly du Buclet is a full-time legislator and a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives. She has been serving the 5th district since May 13, 2023. Before her current role, she served as the Vice President on the Board of Commissioners of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRDGC).

She was appointed by The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to serve on the Local Government Advisory Committee (LGAC), a national advisory committee that helps implement various public health and environmental programs ensuring clean air, water, safe drinking water, and responsible waste disposal.

Before her political career, she was the Legislative and Community Affairs Director for the Chicago Park District and an adjunct professor at Roosevelt University. She was born and raised on Chicago's south side and attended The University of Chicago Lab School. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Marketing from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an MBA in Marketing from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

In her previous roles, she served on the board of commissioners for the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRDGC). She represented the 26th District in the Illinois House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013. She was appointed to her seat in May 2011 after former incumbent William D. Burns stepped down as District 26 representative to become Chicago's 4th Ward alderman, but did not run for a full term in the 2012 election.

In 2018, du Buclet won a special election to finish the remaining two years of an unexpired term on the Board of Commissioners of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. The seat had been vacated by Cynthia Santos, and had been held by interim appointee David Walsh prior to Neely's assumption of office. In 2020, du Buclet won the Democratic primary for reelection to a full-term on the board in an election to fill the three seats on the board with expiring terms. She was reelected, winning the most votes of any candidate in the general election. On January 5, 2023, she was elected by the board of commissioners to serve as its vice president.

On May 13, 2023, du Buclet was appointed to fill the 5th district seat in the Illinois House of Representatives that was vacated after her predecessor Lamont Robinson became a Chicago alderman.

Kimberly du Buclet is a mother of two and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and The Links, Inc.
