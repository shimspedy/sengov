Jason R. Bunting is the State Representative of Illinois’ 106th House District. The district covers parts of Ford, Grundy, Iroquois, LaSalle, Livingston, McLean, and Will Counties. He was appointed to the Illinois House in February 2023.

Before his appointment, Bunting owned and maintained a family farm and trucking business in rural Emington in Livingston County near Interstate 55. He also co-owned a seed business in Livingston County. His deep roots in agriculture and business have given him a unique perspective on the needs and challenges of his constituents.

Bunting has a history of public service. He served previously in elected office as the Highway Commissioner of Broughton Township. He was also a Livingston County board member for eight years. His commitment to his community is evident in his previous roles as President of the Livingston County Farm Bureau and as a Director for the Illinois Corn Growers’ Association.

As a representative, Bunting is a fiscal conservative working to protect the rights of property owners and law-abiding gun owners. He opposes the raising of taxes and works diligently to protect the residents he serves. Bunting is also focused on putting his knowledge of agriculture to good use, hoping to bridge the gap between production agriculture and the urban lifestyle.

Bunting received his Associate’s degree from Joliet Junior College and is a graduate of Dwight Township High School. He lives in Emington with his wife, Tasha, and their three children. His commitment to his family, his community, and his constituents is a testament to his dedication and service.
