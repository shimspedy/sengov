David Gregory is a member of the Missouri State Senate, representing District 15. He assumed office on January 8, 2025. His current term ends on January 3, 2029. In 2016, he was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives. Right away, David’s investigative acumen took off as he was named “Freshman Legislator of the Year” for outstanding work on preventing government waste, fraud and abuse.

But, David did not stop there. He concluded his first term by using his accounting background and unique investigation skills in a bold, new way. Conducting his own audit of the Department of Revenue, David’s novel investigation found tens of millions of dollars in savings for Missouri taxpayers.

In 2021, David became the chairman of his own special investigations committee. Handpicked by the Speaker of the House, David led Missouri’s Special Committee on Government Accountability.

Now, David is determined to Save St. Louis. As a St. Louis native, born and raised, he knows Saving St. Louis starts with safety. David’s Save St. Louis Plan includes a specialized Missouri police force designed to assist local police with the arrest and prosecution of violent criminals. His plan also focuses on bringing high paying jobs back to St. Louis through common sense tax breaks, economic incentives and a safe environment for businesses to recruit talent to St. Louis.

Most importantly, David is a Christian. After witnessing a local government use the COVID-19 virus to limit church and religious gatherings, David filed a pro bono lawsuit against St. Louis County Executive Sam Page. David argued – and believes – that our First Amendment right to practice our faith and assemble as a body is a fundamental constitutional right.

David’s pursuit of justice through legal action didn’t stop there. David later sued Sam Page and St. Louis County again to ensure our seniors got the property tax freeze they deserve. He also launched a legal investigation against Life Time Fitness for allowing men to use the women’s locker room, resulting in women and children being exposed to inappropriate male body parts.

Today, David continues to use his skills as an attorney to protect women, children and animals. 88% of animal abusers are also abusing a woman or child. As a result, David leverages his experience as a litigator to locate and sue animal abusers. One of David’s lawsuits against an animal abuser resulted in a landmark $1.3 million judgment.

David is a St. Louis native born and raised and he lives in Chesterfield with his wife, Paige. He has an accounting degree, a Masters of Business Administration, and a Juris Doctor from Saint Louis University.
