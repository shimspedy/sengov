Notably, she and her husband, state representative Jermond (Jay) Mosley, make history as the first married couple to concurrently serve in the Missouri Legislature.

During her first legislative session, Senator Mosley achieved a significant milestone by jointly passing House Bill 402 with her husband, making them the first married couple to accomplish such a feat in the Missouri General Assembly. The bill prevents the publishing of identifying information of state lottery winners by the State Lottery Commission and its affiliates.

As a public servant, Senator Mosley is devoted to assisting her constituents. She organized a successful COVID-19 vaccination clinic that benefited over 2,000 residents of North County on March 20, 2021. Additionally, she continues to host an annual community resource fair and book bag drive, a legacy of her late stepmother, former state representative Juanita Head Walton, and a testament to her belief in making a tangible difference through district outreach events. Senator Angela Walton Mosley's commitment to her constituents extends to significant accomplishments such as securing $6 million in funding for the demolition of the Jamestown Mall. This crucial contribution underscores her dedication to revitalizing and improving her district, creating a positive impact on the community's landscape and future prospects.

Born and raised in St. Louis, specifically Walnut Park, Senator Mosley is a product of St. Louis Public Schools, having attended Visual and Performing Arts at Shaw (elementary), Marquette (middle) and Central (high school). She pursued higher education at Grambling State University, a prestigious Historically Black University, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree.

A family of public servants surrounds Senator Mosley, as her father, late stepmother, sister, brother-in-law and husband have all served or are currently serving in the Missouri House of Representatives.

In addition to her impactful political contributions, Senator Mosley is an active member of the esteemed Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., and a dedicated union member with CWA, the Communication Workers of America, Local 6300.

The 13th Senatorial District encompasses various cities and unincorporated areas in St. Louis County, including Bellefontaine Neighbors, Blackjack, Castlepoint, Country Club Hills, Flordell Hills, Florissant, Glasgow Village, Hathaway, Jennings, Moline Acres, Old Jamestown and Riverview.
