Senator Kurtis Gregory took the oath of office on Jan. 8, 2025 and represents the 21st Senatorial District. He previously served in the Missouri House of Representatives from 2020-2024.

Senator Gregory owns a farm alongside his wife, Kella, and his parents, Roger and Ruth. Together, they farm corn and soybeans on 900 acres and custom feed 2,400 pigs for a local family-owned hog operation. Senator Gregory has served on the board of directors for Missouri Corn Growers and is a local delegate for MFA Oil. He is also a member of the Saline County Farm Bureau, Missouri Corn Growers Association and Missouri Cattlemen’s Association. Senator Gregory received the Farm Bureau Friend of Agriculture Award in 2022 and participated in the Corn Growers inaugural CornRoots Leadership Class in 2013.

Before going back to the farm, Sen. Gregory played on the University of Missouri football team from 2006-2009. He played Left Tackle in 2006 and started 41 straight games at Right Guard from 2007 until he graduated. In 2007, his Tigers beat Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl and finished the season ranked 4th in the nation. In 2008, they beat Northwestern in the Alamo Bowl, and in 2009, he served as team captain. Senator Gregory also had a short stint in the NFL with the Carolina Panthers.

Senator Gregory has been a national pioneer in Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) legislation, passing multiple influential bills during his time in the legislature. In 2023, along with SEC Commissioner Greg Sanky, and Condoleezza Rice, Sports Illustrated named him one of the 25 Most Intriguing Suits in College Football.

Born in Blackburn, Missouri, Sen. Gregory currently resides in Marshall with his wife, Kella, and three children, Brook, Landon, and Henley, where they attend Calvary Baptist Church. He is a graduate of Santa Fe R-10 High School in Alma and earned his Bachelor’s degree and a Master’s degree in General Agriculture from the University of Missouri.
