State Representative Kimberly-Ann Collins, a Democrat was elected to her first term in 2020 to represent the City of St. Louis. She is a lifelong and current resident North city St. Louis.

Collins is well known across the state for advocating for Correctional reform and for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. She has opened up homeless shelters in the City of St. Louis and in her few years of serving in the House of Representatives, she has conducted more than 200 prison pop-ups at all 19 correctional facilities in the state. Collins is dedicated to creating change in Missouri prisons through policy and boots on the ground support in both men and women prisons.

Collins graduated from the University of Missouri Kansas-City with a Bachelor of Science in Public Health Sciences and a minor of Arts in Chemistry. Although her background is in public health, her passion is serving her community.

Collins is the current President for The Ville/Greater Ville Neighborhood Association, Board member for Northside Youth and Senior Services, and a appointed member of the Missouri Justice Reinvestment Executive Oversight Council, which oversees and monitors the implementation of policies designed to reduce the prison population and make more efficient use of Missouri taxpayer dollars.

Representative Collins is the daughter of Dr. LaTonia Collins Smith, 21st president and the first Black woman president of Harris-Stowe State University.
