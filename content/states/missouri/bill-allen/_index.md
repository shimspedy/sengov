Representative Bill Allen, a Republican, represents part of Clay County (District 17) in the Missouri House of Representatives. District 17 includes the Northland section of Kansas City, Pleasant Valley, Claycomo, Randolph and Birmingham. He was elected to his first two-year term in November 2022. In an evenly divided district, Allen strives to represent all constituents in an even, fair and respectful manner.

In addition to his service in the legislature, Allen is a Vice Chancellor at a public university. Previously, he served as Professor, Dean and Provost. In the Department of Labor’s Job Corps program, Allen led the nation’s only JROTC program at the Excelsior Springs Job Corps Center and provided executive-level leadership as Center Director at two campuses (Missouri and North Dakota.)

Prior to Job Corps, Allen proudly served on active duty in the United States Navy for nearly 26 years. He was enlisted for 15 years working from E1 through E7. He earned a commission through Officer Candidate School (OCS) and ultimately retired at the rank of Lieutenant Commander.

Representative Allen grew up in Kansas City, Kansas, Turner School District, in a single-parent home below the poverty level. At the age of 16, he was sent to a children’s home in Arkansas. Issues of poverty, childcare, school breakfast/lunches, school safety and programs to assist underserved communities remain critically important to him.

Active in his community, Allen is a member of the Northland Chamber of Commerce, the East Clay County Rotary Club and is a former President in the Excelsior Springs Rotary Club, as well as a Rotary District Secretary for Northern Missouri. He is a member of Knights of Columbus and the Harley-Davidson Owners Group. Allen plays bass in the classic rock band “Basement Trash,” which seeks to raise funds for community projects.

Allen received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautics from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He received an MBA from Troy University and a PhD in Management from Capella University.

Allen resides in KCMO with his fun-loving wife, Marta. They have three children. Allen actively attends St. James Catholic Church in Liberty.
