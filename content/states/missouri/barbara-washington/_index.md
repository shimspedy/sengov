Senator Barbara Anne Washington, a Democrat, represents the 9th Senatorial District in the Missouri Senate. She was sworn into office on Jan. 6, 2021. Prior to being elected to the Senate, she served the residents of Jackson County in the House of Representatives for three years.

Senator Washington proudly supports increased economic development in her district – including preserving the notable “18th & Vine” district, increased funding for educational opportunities and universal health care for all. In her district, she regularly presents programs designed to bring attention to the importance of small business development, juvenile justice reform, minority mental health awareness, crime reduction and environmental preservation.

When she’s not advocating for her district, Sen. Washington volunteers with her beloved sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. She is a member of the St. James United Methodist Church, the Metropolitan Community Colleges Board of Trustees, Urban Summit, Freedom, Inc., the Kansas City Boys/Girls Choir and the United Nations Association of Greater Kansas City.

In addition to her legislative duties, Sen. Washington is a practicing attorney who also possesses an MBA. She is a proud graduate of the University of Missouri-Columbia’s famed School of Journalism. She obtained her Master of Business Administration from Avila University and her Juris Doctorate from the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

Senator Washington is a lifelong Kansas City, Missouri, resident. She has one daughter and two grandsons.
