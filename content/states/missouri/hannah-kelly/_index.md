Rep. Hannah Kelly, a Republican, represents Wright County, and parts of Douglas, Laclede, and Webster Counties (District 141) in the Missouri House of Representatives.

Graduating from Liberty Faith Christian Academy, she became a Realtor at the age of 18, and obtained her brokerage license a few years thereafter, managing a real estate brokerage full-time until her run for office in 2016. She now owns a real estate company with her sister in Wright County.

She is a member of Liberty Faith Church where she regularly attends, as well as a member of the Mountain Grove Chamber of Commerce. She also volunteers routinely at Camp Joy Bible Youth Camp each summer. She has tremendously enjoyed her time as a foster parent, and is grateful that through that journey, she is now a mom. Service defines Hannahâ€™s past as well as her future.
