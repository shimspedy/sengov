Senator Maggie Nurrenbern was elected in 2024 to represent the 17th Senatorial District in Clay County in the Missouri Senate. She previously served in the Missouri House of Representatives, elected by the citizens of House District 15 in 2020. 

Sen. Nurrenbern is a lifelong resident of Clay County and a 2002 graduate of Smithville High School. She earned her bachelor’s degree from Truman State University in Communication: Journalism and participated in the Truman State internship program, interning in the Missouri Senate in 2006.

Following graduation, Sen. Nurrenbern married her husband Gregg and together they joined the Peace Corps. They spent two years as Peace Corps Volunteers working in public health and education in the rural community of El Chaco, Ecuador.

Upon returning to Missouri, Sen. Nurrenbern returned to school to earn her teaching certificate in Spanish, master’s degree in Curriculum and Instruction and TESOL endorsement from UMKC. She taught Spanish, Journalism and ELL at University Academy in Kansas City and North Kansas City High School, sponsoring numerous student organizations and serving as the building representative for the NKC-NEA. As a former teacher, union, and PTA member, Sen. Nurrenbern has brought focus and expertise to education policy in the Missouri legislature. 

Senator Nurrenbern continues her commitment to community service as a board member for Feed Northland Kids, a member of the PTA at Oakwood Manor Elementary School, the Gladstone and Northland Chambers of Commerce and Holy Family Catholic Church. Her proudest title of all is “mom.” She and her husband Gregg have three sons, Luke, Eli and Henry.
