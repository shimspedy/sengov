Representative Bob Titus, a Republican, represents western Christian County (District 139) in the Missouri House of Representatives. He was elected to his first two-year term in November 2022.

Prior to his legislative duties, Titus was a business owner and agent representing a major multiline insurance company for 30 years. Serving his insurance clients well was a significant source of pride and satisfaction. Bob retired his business upon successfully gaining an opportunity to serve the residents of Missouri House District 139.

Bob and Tammy Titus first moved to Christian County in 1984. They have lived in their current home near Billings since 1994 and there raised their 10 children. God has continued to bless them with the rich addition of six children-in-law and 14 grandchildren. No family gathering is short of a happy crowd.

Bobâ€™s priorities of faith and family are not only a catalyst for government service, they are the qualities that best represent the values of Christian County. Bob uses his 30 years of business and financial service to ensure the best interests of district, county, and state, are well represented in Jefferson City.

Bob has an Accounting degree from Missouri State University. Family occupations and expertise include the fields of business, health, science, first-responders, aviation, and disabilities. The favorite family activity is outdoor recreation.
