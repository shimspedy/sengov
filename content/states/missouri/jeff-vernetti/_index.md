Representative Jeff Vernetti is a dedicated public servant and accomplished entrepreneur who represents Camden County (District 123) in the Missouri House of Representatives. A Republican, he was elected to his first term in November 2024, bringing a wealth of experience in business, community development, and leadership to his role.

Born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Jeff Vernetti graduated from Lafayette High School in 1995. He pursued higher education at Southeast Missouri State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mass Communications in 1999. His early career saw him thrive as a sports broadcaster in St. Louis, where he spent over a decade hosting sports talk shows and building a reputation for his engaging communication style and deep understanding of the sports industry.

In addition to his broadcasting career, Vernetti ventured into business and real estate development, where he made a significant impact. He co-founded and co-owns Ballparks National, a premier youth baseball and softball complex located in the Lake of the Ozarks area. Under his leadership as General Manager, Ballparks National hosted over 5,000 games, attracting teams from 21 states and contributing millions of dollars to the local economy. The facility, which employs over 50 staff members, has been recognized as Missouri’s Best Youth Sports Complex.

Vernetti's entrepreneurial spirit extends beyond Ballparks National. He is also the co-owner of LOZ Sports Training, the leading youth sports facility in the region, and Vernetti’s Italian Grocer, a specialty market offering authentic St. Louis-style Italian cuisine. These ventures reflect his commitment to fostering community engagement and economic growth in the Lake of the Ozarks area.

In his role as a state representative, Vernetti brings extensive expertise in budget management, personnel oversight, and strategic planning. He is deeply involved in his community, serving on the boards of several organizations, including the Central Ozarks Medical Center, the Lake West Chamber of Commerce, and the Lake of the Ozarks Regional Economic Development Council. He is also an active member of the Camdenton Rotary Club, the Osage Beach Elks Club, and Calvary Chapel Lake of the Ozarks.

Jeff Vernetti's dedication to public service is matched by his commitment to his family. He resides in Camdenton with his wife, Kelly, and their two children, Dominick and Isabella. Together, they are active participants in the vibrant community life of Camden County.

As a legislator, Vernetti is focused on promoting economic development, supporting small businesses, and enhancing the quality of life for his constituents. His diverse background and proven leadership make him a valuable advocate for the people of District 123.
