Scott Cupps, a native of Shell Knob, Missouri, is an American politician who currently serves as a member of the Missouri House of Representatives, representing the 158th district. His political journey began with his election in November 2019, and he officially assumed office on January 5, 2020.

Before entering the realm of politics, Cupps owned and operated a farm, bringing valuable real-world experience to his legislative role. In 2019, he won a special election for the Missouri House of Representatives following Scott Fitzpatrick's resignation, who had stepped down to take on the role of the 47th treasurer of Missouri.
