Representative Jaclyn Zimmermann, a Democrat, proudly represents part of St. Louis County (District 98) in the Missouri House of Representatives. She was elected to her first two-year term in November 2024.

A lifelong resident of Missouri, Rep. Zimmermann grew up in Steelville and graduated from Steelville High School in 1998. She holds a Bachelor’s degree in Sociology from Missouri State University, earned in 2002, and a Juris Doctorate from the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, completed in 2005. As a practicing employment lawyer at Ponder Zimmermann LLC in St. Louis, she brings a wealth of legal experience to her legislative work, advocating for justice and fairness in her community.

Outside of her professional responsibilities, Rep. Zimmermann enjoys spending quality time with her husband, Todd, and their three children: Sam, Ben, and Tyler. Family plays a central role in her life, and she values the time she spends with them as a way to stay grounded and focused in both her legal and legislative endeavors. Rep. Zimmermann’s background in law and her commitment to public service make her a dedicated advocate for her constituents in the Missouri House.
