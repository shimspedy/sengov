He has served as Chairman of the Board for the American Red Cross of Central and Northern Missouri, is a program coordinator for neighborhood watch, and is a life member of the VFW, NRA, and MO National Guard Association.

A lifelong Missourian, Schulte was born in St. Louis and now resides in New Bloomfield with his wife, Janelle. They have two children and two grandchildren, with the third on the way.
