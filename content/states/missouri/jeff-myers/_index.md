Representative Jeff Myers, a Republican, represents Warren and Montgomery Counties (District 42) in the Missouri House of Representatives. He was elected to his first two-year term in November 2022.

In addition to his legislative service, Myers is the owner of two local businesses: a firearms training company and a garage door installation company. He also is a recently retired trooper for the Missouri State Highway Patrol after almost 30 years of service. A 19-year-member of the Missouri State Trooper Association, Myers served as vice president for the majority of his tenure.

A 1987 graduate of Warren County R-III, Myers received his bachelorâ€™s degree in Physical Education from the Central Methodist College in 1993.

Myers is active in his faith and is involved with the Calvary Orphan Outreach and Greater Love Ministries that serve in Uganda to help orphaned children. He also volunteers as coordinator for Financial Peace University hosted through Calvary Chapel in Troy.

A lifelong Missourian, Myers currently resides in Warrenton with his wife of 30 years, Julie. They are the proud parents of two adult children. They enjoy spending their spare time volunteering with their church and remaining active in their community.
