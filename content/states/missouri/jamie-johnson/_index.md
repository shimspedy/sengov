Representative Jamie Johnson, a Democrat, represents part of Platte County (District 12) in the Missouri House of Representatives. She was elected to her first two-year term in November 2022.

Prior to her service with the legislature, Johnson was a human resources professional at a large Midwest regional financial services organization.

Johnson grew up in a military family with her father serving in the Army and 11 other members of her family now being retired from military service.

She holds degrees in Urban Planning and Design and Organizational Development Psychology from the University of Missouri-Kansas City and Avila University. She is a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.

Born in Los Angeles, Johnson has made her home in the Northland for the last 17 years after her family was displaced from New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. She is the first black person to represent Platte County in the legislature. She lives there with her three children.
