Representative Raychel Proudie, a Democrat, represents parts of North St. Louis County (District 73) in the Missouri House of Representatives. She was elected to her first term as a state representative in November 2018.

Proudie is a certified Classroom Teacher and School Counselor in Missouri, Illinois, and Louisiana and has extensive experience working in public schools in urban and rural areas in both traditional public and charter schools.

Proudie is known for her expertise on Pre-K 12 policy and procedures. She has earned a B.S in Elementary Education and a Doctoral Candidate (Ed.D) at Grambling State University, and an M.A. in Mental Health Counseling at Southern University and A&M College.

Proudie also is a member of several professional organizations including National Association for Developmental Education, National Academic Advising Association, National Alliance of Black School Educators, and the Missouri National Education Association.

Experience and community engagement drives Proudieâ€™s desire to be involved in leading and implementing sound policies. In addition to her work as a legislator, she is actively involved in several community, neighborhood and township organizations. She is honored to deliver meals to seniors, organize coat and glove drives, attend local high school sporting events to cheer on the home team, and mentor students as they prepare for post-secondary life.

Proudie is the middle child of an Honorably Discharged Army Veteran (late) and a State of Missouri employee who has dedicated her life and career to mental health care. She is proudly parenting her nephew, who is a student at M.S. Berkeley High School in Ferguson, MO.
