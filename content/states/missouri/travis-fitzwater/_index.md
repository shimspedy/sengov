Travis Fitzwater is a husband, father and business professional who started his career in politics knocking on doors for local campaigns in mid-Missouri. Once then-Rep. Jeanie Riddle decided to run for the Senate, Travis ran for and won her House seat in 2014, serving in the chamber for eight years. Consequently, upon Sen. Riddle’s much-deserved retirement after a long career of public service as a teacher, House and Senate member in 2022, Travis ran for her Senate seat and won a close primary, subsequently going on to win the general election in November.

He has spent his life outside the Capitol serving God and community, working in college ministry, serving thousands in nonprofit management, investing in real estate and starting small companies while also administering his wife’s counseling business.

He graduated from Presbyterian College in South Carolina with a bachelor’s degree in political science with an emphasis on international relations. Travis has also attained a master’s degree in Atlantic history and politics from the Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy at the University of Missouri.

He and his beautiful wife, Amy, and three daughters live in Holts Summit with their beloved dog. His wife is a licensed professional counselor committed to serving children and families in mid-Missouri. They homeschool their daughters who love ice skating, playing, reading, traveling, being outside and spending Friday nights over pizza and movies.
