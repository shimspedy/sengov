Adam Schnelting is a Republican member of the Missouri Senate, representing the 23rd district. He assumed office on January 8, 2025. Before his tenure in the Senate, Schnelting served in the Missouri House of Representatives, representing the 69th district from January 4, 2023, to January 8, 2025, and the 104th district from January 9, 2019, to January 4, 2023.

Born in St. Charles, Missouri, Schnelting is a seventh-generation Missourian whose family has been in America since 1628. He is a licensed realtor, minister, and former church planter. Schnelting is also a combat engineer in the Missouri Army National Guard and a former member of the Missouri State Defense Force and the State Guard Association of the United States. He is actively involved with the National Rifle Association of America, Missouri Right to Life, and the American Center for Law and Justice.

Schnelting obtained his degree in Christian Ministry from Oklahoma Wesleyan University and his baccalaureate degree from the University of Missouri-St. Louis. He also attended State Fair Community College and Rhema Bible College.

In his political career, Schnelting has been a legislative assistant in the Missouri House of Representatives. In 2016, he ran in the Republican primary for the 65th house district but lost to Tom Hannegan. However, in 2018, he ran unopposed in the August primary for the 104th district and defeated Democrat Peggy Sherwin in the November general election. He was re-elected in 2020, defeating Democratic candidate Jessica DeVoto. Due to state redistricting, Schnelting moved to District 69, where he again faced DeVoto in the 2022 election and defeated her by a larger margin than in 2020.

Schnelting introduced HJR116, an amendment to the Missouri state constitution authorizing the creation of the Missouri Department of the National Guard, during the 2022 legislative session. The amendment was approved by Missouri voters in the 2022 general election. Prior to the amendment, the Missouri National Guard was a part of the state's Department of Public Safety. Schnelting also authored, introduced, and passed Missouri's abortion ban.

In the Missouri Senate, Schnelting serves on several committees, including the Economic and Workforce Development Committee, the Judiciary and Civil and Criminal Jurisprudence Committee, the Transportation, Infrastructure and Public Safety Committee (where he is Vice-Chair), and the Veterans and Military Affairs Committee (where he is also Vice-Chair). He is also a member of the Missouri Emergency Response Commission, the Stop Cyberstalking and Harassment Task Force, the Joint Committee on Rural Economic Development, the Joint Committee on Tax Policy, and the Joint Committee on Transportation Oversight.

Schnelting's dedication to public service and his commitment to his constituents have made him a prominent figure in Missouri politics. His diverse background and extensive experience in various fields contribute to his effectiveness as a legislator and advocate for the people of Missouri.
