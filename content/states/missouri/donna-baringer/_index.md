Rep. Donna M. C. Baringer, a Democrat, represents the city of St. Louis (District 82) in the Missouri House of Representatives. She was elected to her first two-year term in November 2016 and re-elected in 2018.

Baringerâ€™s first experience with public policy was at the age of five, when she served as page for a day in the Missouri State Senate. While always involved in many aspects of community building, it was her accomplishments as the Executive Director of Magdalen Community Improvement Corporation that led Baringer to run for and win her election for the 16th ward alderman in the City of St. Louis in 2003. Later, in 2016, she ran a successful campaign to represent the 82nd district in the House of Representatives.

Baringer earned a B.S. in Business Management from Maryville University and a M.S. in Corporate Communications from Lindenwood University.

She married her husband in 1991. They are the proud parents of two grown sons.
