Yolanda R. Young, a Democrat, represents Jackson County (District 22) in the Missouri House of Representatives. She was elected in a special election to her first term beginning in January 2020. Representative Young also currently serves as a Board member of the Children’s Trust Fund, and has been appointed by the Governor to serve on the Victims of Sexual Assault Task Force.

Representative Young’s goals include pushing legislation that addresses the current needs of children, youth, families, and seniors especially as we seek recovery from the impact of COVID-19. Long-term, she strives to make sure that residents of District 22 have the opportunity to obtain quality affordable healthcare; jobs that provide families with livable wages; and access to a quality education.

She prides herself on her three decades mobilizing residents around issues that matter to them and she worked closely with community-based partners from various sectors to obtain resources for area residents. It is this very experience and passion for grass roots organizing that has been the natural bridge for her work as a legislator. To this end, the Kansas City Crime Commission chose her as a recipient of the Alvin Brooks Award for her community service related to crime prevention.

When not in Jefferson City, she operates a small urban farm business, Young Family Farm seeks to provide healthy food alternatives for neighbors in the urban core where food deserts are common. Her past work experience includes a long period of service with the Ivanhoe Neighborhood Council, where her last role was as Managing Director for Community Outreach and Engagement. Representative Young has been married to her husband, Alan, for over 35 years, and they have 4 adult children and 6 precious grandchildren.
