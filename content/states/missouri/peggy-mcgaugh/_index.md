Representative Peggy McGaugh, a Republican, represents Carroll, Linn, Livingston, and part of Ray counties, proudly serving the 7th District in the Missouri House of Representatives.

Representative McGaugh had the distinct honor of serving nearly six four-year terms as Carroll County Clerk until winning a special election in February of 2018, for Missouri House District 39, as successor to her son, Judge Joe Don McGaugh.

She has served a total of 32 years in the Carroll County Clerk’s office; is the former Treasurer of the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities; served as the President of the statewide organization, Missouri Association of Counties in 2009, representing all County elected officials of the State; and serves as the Vice President of the Missouri Public Entities Labor Relations Association.

Representative McGaugh was previously a member of the Secretary of State’s voter integrity task force and decided to make the transition from the county government to the state government so that she could advocate for free and fair elections. Additionally, she wants greater economic development for rural communities and to increase the number of jobs in those areas.

She and her husband, David, have made rural Carroll County their home since 1979. They are parents of two children, son, Judge Joe Don McGaugh and his wife, Kassie (Long) McGaugh, and daughter, Jocelyn (McGaugh) Blue and her husband, Eric Blue of Kansas City. Peggy and her husband have three grandchildren, Nora Kate, Vivian, and Gemma.
