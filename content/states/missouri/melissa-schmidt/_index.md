Melissa Schmidt is a dedicated public servant and a Republican representative for District 141 in the Missouri House of Representatives. She represents Wright County and parts of Laclede, Webster, and Douglas Counties. Elected in November 2024, she began her first term in January 2025, bringing with her a wealth of experience in education, nonprofit development, and community service.

Melissa has spent over three decades working in both public and private education, as well as nonprofit program development. She is a state-certified childcare center director and has been deeply involved in early childhood education. Her career includes roles in administration, program coordination, and as a Parents as Teachers educator, where she worked directly with families to support early childhood development. She also founded and directed a nonprofit preschool, demonstrating her commitment to accessible and high-quality education for young children.

In addition to her professional achievements, Melissa has a strong history of community involvement. She has served on several nonprofit boards, including her local Pregnancy Resource Center, where she contributed as a board member, program developer, and parent educator. She is an active member of organizations like Kiwanis and Rotary clubs and serves on the Lebanon R-3 Early Childhood Advisory Board. Her leadership extends to her church, where she and her husband, Aaron, hold key roles within their faith community.

Melissa is a passionate advocate for conservative values and has been a vocal supporter of issues such as education, small businesses, veterans, and law enforcement. As the daughter of a retired law enforcement officer, she has a deep respect for those who serve and protect. She is also committed to increasing access to mental health care and supporting the aging population in her district. Her dedication to fighting for the unborn and strengthening families underscores her belief in servant leadership.

Outside of her legislative duties, Melissa enjoys life on her hobby farm with her husband of over 30 years. Together, they have raised two adult children and cherish their roles as aunt and uncle to more than 20 nieces and nephews. Melissaâ€™s lifelong connection to southern Missouri and her unwavering commitment to her community make her a uniquely qualified and passionate representative for her district.
