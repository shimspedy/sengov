Mary Elizabeth Coleman, an American politician, attorney, and pro-life activist hailing from Arnold, Missouri, currently holds the position of representing the 22nd district in the Missouri Senate since 2023. Her political journey began as a state representative from 2019 to 2023, and she also served as an Arnold city councilwoman from 2013 to 2015.

Early Life and Education
Coleman was raised in Georgetown, Texas, and she pursued her academic endeavors with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Saint Louis University. Subsequently, she earned a Juris Doctor from St. Mary's University School of Law.

Career
Coleman's professional background includes working as an associate at Oppenheimer, Blend, Harrison, and Tate from 2007 to 2009. Following this, she became a member of the Arnold, Missouri City Council. Coleman operated her independent law firm from 2009 to 2015 before joining TuckerAllen in 2015. Notably, she has also contributed to the Thomas More Society, an anti-abortion law firm.

Arnold City Council
In a significant political stride, on April 2, 2013, Coleman secured an open seat on the Arnold, Missouri City Council, representing the 2nd ward. Her term commenced on April 11, and although she did not seek re-election in 2015, her impact was noteworthy.

Missouri House of Representatives
March 2018 marked Coleman's announcement of her campaign for the Missouri House of Representatives in the 97th district, considered competitive after a Democrat's victory in a February 2018 special election. As a legislator, she chaired the House Children and Families Committee and proposed significant bills, including one modeled after the Texas Heartbeat Act. In 2022, Coleman advocated restrictions for Missouri women seeking abortions outside the state.

Missouri Senate
In February 2021, Coleman declared her candidacy for a seat in the Missouri Senate. She emerged victorious in the Republican primary, securing first place against three opponents. Subsequently, she triumphed in the general election of 2022, solidifying her role in the Missouri Senate.
