Barbara Wasinger is an American politician who was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives in 2018 as a Republican. Prior to serving in the Kansas Legislature, she served as an Ellis County Commissioner, the first woman elected to the county commission.

From 2005 to 2012, she served as a city commissioner in Hays, Kansas and served as Mayor of Hays from April 2008 to April 2009 and October 2010 to April 2012. While mayor, she served on the Hays Public Library Board.

In her role as a representative, she has held several committee assignments. In the 2020-2021 term, she served as the Chairman of Joint Administrative Rules and Regulations, Vice Chairman of Higher Education Budget, and was a member of the Financial Institutions and Rural Development, and Taxation committees. In the 2019-2020 term, she served on the Financial Institutions and Pensions, Higher Education Budget, Taxation, and Joint Administrative Rules and Regulations committees.

In addition to her political career, Wasinger has made several promises to her constituents. She has promised to get funds for schools to reopen and operate safely, promote solutions to good healthcare for Kansans, ease regulations for foster parents to place more kids in good homes, and reduce the food sales tax and property tax relief for seniors and all Kansans.

She has also outlined her priorities for 2023, which include fighting to eliminate all Kansas taxes on retirement funds for seniors, continuing to fight for FHSU students and funding, fighting to remove burdensome regulations that strangle all Kansas businesses, advocating for more of the $6.5 billion given to K-12 to be used for the children, teachers and special education, and working to eliminate overbearing rules and regulations in foster parenting to allow for more child placement.
