Kristey Williams is a member of the Kansas House of Representatives, representing District 77. She assumed office on January 12, 2015, and her current term ends on January 13, 2025. She is a member of the Republican Party.

Born on October 16, 1970, in Augusta, Kansas, Williams has lived in Augusta since at least February 2020. She earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1993 and a master's in education in 1997, both from the University of Kansas.

Before entering politics, Williams had a career in education. She worked as a science teacher with the Buhler School District and the Andover School District. Her commitment to her community extended beyond her professional life, as she volunteered with Project Play Park and the Save Our State Street Campaign.

In 2007, Williams was elected to serve as the mayor of Augusta, Kansas, marking the start of her political career. She ran for re-election to the Kansas House of Representatives to represent District 77 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Throughout her tenure, Williams has served on several committees. For the 2023-2024 term, she was assigned to the Appropriations Committee, Commerce, Labor and Economic Development Committee, K-12 Education Budget Committee (as Chair), and Legislative Post Audit Committee. She had similar assignments in the 2021-2022 and 2019-2020 terms. In the 2017 legislative session, she served on the Elections, Federal and State Affairs, Local Government (as Chair), and Taxation committees. At the beginning of her term in 2015, she served on several other committees.

In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Williams endorsed Marco Rubio for the Republican primary.
