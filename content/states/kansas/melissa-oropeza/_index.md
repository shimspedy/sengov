Melissa Oropeza is an American politician currently serving as a member of the Kansas House of Representatives from the 37th district. Her term began on January 9, 2023.

Born and raised in Wyandotte County, Kansas, Oropeza is a fourth-generation resident of the area, often referred to as a "Dotte". She completed her early education at Turner High School before pursuing higher education in the field of nursing.

She attended Kansas City Kansas Community College where she received her associate degree in nursing. Following this, she enrolled at the University of Kansas, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and a Master of Science in Nursing. Her educational journey culminated at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, where she graduated with a Doctor of Nursing Practice in 2020.

Before entering politics, Oropeza had a successful career in healthcare spanning 23 years. For 11 of those years, she practiced as a Nurse Practitioner in a Gastroenterology Practice located in Wyandotte County. Her dedication and innovative ideas in her professional career led to her recognition as the Nursing Advocate for Kansas by the American Association of Nurse Practitioners in 2017.

In addition to her healthcare career, Oropeza has also served on the Kansas State Board of Nursing, further showcasing her commitment to the field of nursing and healthcare.

As a State Representative, Oropeza is committed to going above and beyond to help the residents of District 37, just as she did for the patients within her practice. Her campaign and subsequent election to the Kansas House of Representatives mark her dedication to public service and her desire to make a positive impact in her community.
