Brenda Dietrich, born on May 16, 1953, is an American politician and a member of the Republican party. She was born in Colby, Kansas, where her family had a rich history of farming thousands of acres in Thomas County. When she was in 5th grade, her family moved to McPherson, Kansas.

Dietrich graduated from McPherson High School and went on to pursue higher education at Kansas State University. There, she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Elementary Education. She furthered her education at the University of Missouri–Kansas City, where she earned her Master’s Degree in Education Administration and her Ph.D. in Education Administration with a minor in Business Management.

Before entering politics, Dietrich had a long and successful career in education spanning 40 years. She served in various roles including teacher, building administrator, and Superintendent. She was the Superintendent of the Auburn-Washburn School District in Topeka, Kansas from 2001 to 2015.
