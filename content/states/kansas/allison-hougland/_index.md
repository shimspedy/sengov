Allison Hougland is an American politician and realtor serving as a member of the Kansas House of Representatives from the 16th district. She was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 9, 2023.

Born and raised in Olathe, Kansas, Allison Hougland is not only a politician but also a small business owner, a mother, a grandmother, and a proud, lifelong Olathean. Her father was a state representative and judge, and her mother was a small business owner. Decades of experience in sales has taught her to be a good listener, build relationships, and find common ground. Now, she wants to bring these skills to Topeka to serve the citizens of Kansas and the 15th House District.

Before her political career, Hougland has been employed as a realtor for the last six years. In 2022, she ran for the Kansas House. She won over Republican nominee Matt Bingesser by 78 votes. In the state legislature, she serves on the committees for homelessness, welfare reform, elections, and child welfare and foster care.

During her tenure, she has sponsored several bills. Some of them include proposing to amend the constitution of the state of Kansas to decrease the assessed value for real property used for residential purposes to 9%, increasing the extent of property tax exemption from the statewide school levy for residential property to $65,000 of such property's appraised valuation, and releasing any person convicted of a drug offense involving marijuana from such person's sentence and providing for the expungement of any associated records.

Allison Hougland's term ends on January 13, 2025. She continues to represent the interests of her constituents and work towards a better Kansas.
