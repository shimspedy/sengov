Kyle McNorton is a dedicated public servant and the current representative of District 50 in the Kansas House of Representatives. He is a member of the Republican Party.

McNorton was voted into office to replace Fred Patton, who resigned in September to spend more time with his family. Patton also wanted to give his replacement an extra year of experience. McNorton will finish the term, and run for re-election in 2024. He is a lifelong Kansan, and is excited to get to work in his hometown.

HCR5020 proposes a constitutional amendment to amend section 4 of the Kansas bill of rights to recognize the right to bear arms as a fundamental right. This includes the possession and use of ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components, and that any restrictions on such right are subject to the strict scrutiny standard.

HR6030 condemns the October 7 attacks on the State of Israel. HR6031 supports the strengthening of Kansas' trade partnership with Ireland. HR6033 congratulates and commends the members of the 2024 Kansas Teacher of the Year team. HR6034 aims at strengthening the sister-state ties between the State of Kansas and Taiwan.
