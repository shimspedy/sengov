Rebecca Schmoe is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Kansas House of Representatives from the 59th district. She is a member of the Republican Party.

Schmoe was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives in November 2022 and assumed office on January 9, 2023. She succeeded Blaine Finch, the previous representative of the 59th district.

Schmoe has been a resident of Franklin County, the area she represents in the Kansas House, for over twenty years. This deep connection to her community has undoubtedly influenced her political career and the decisions she makes as a representative.

In addition to her role as a state representative, Schmoe is also a spokesperson for the organization 1 Million Moms Against Gun Control, and she serves as the Kansas State Director for The DC Project. These roles demonstrate her commitment to advocacy and her dedication to issues that are important to her and her constituents.

Schmoe is a Christian, and her faith plays a significant role in her life and work. Her beliefs guide her actions and decisions, both in her personal life and in her role as a state representative.

During her tenure, Schmoe has sponsored several bills and resolutions. Some of the notable ones include HB2126, which authorizes the over-the-counter purchase of ivermectin tablets and hydroxychloroquine tablets, and HB2313, which creates the born-alive infants protection act to provide legal protections for infants who are born alive regardless of the intent of the delivery.

Schmoe's work in the Kansas House of Representatives is ongoing, and she continues to serve her constituents and the state of Kansas with dedication and integrity.
