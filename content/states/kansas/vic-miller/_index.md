Victor W. Miller, born on October 19, 1951, is an American politician who currently serves in the Kansas House of Representatives representing the 58th district and is a former Kansas state senator.

Miller was originally elected to the Kansas House in 1978 from the 53rd House district, serving from 1979 to 1984. In 1984, he ran for the Kansas State Senate in the 18th Senate district, but was defeated by Republican Jeanne Hoferer.

After leaving the House in 1984, he served as a County Commissioner in Shawnee County, Kansas, then as a Topeka Municipal Court Judge. In 2016, he re-entered the legislature, winning election to the 58th House district. He served one term there before being appointed to the 18th Senate district in January of 2019, after the seat was left vacant when Laura Kelly resigned to serve as Governor of Kansas.

Miller finished out the remaining two years of Kelly's term, and then returned to his House seat, successfully running for the House in 2020. During his tenure in the Kansas Senate, he served as Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

On May 7, 2019, he was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving when he drove his car into a Topeka ditch. He was charged with DUI on November 25, 2019 by a special prosecutor assigned the case to avoid conflicts of interest. Miller agreed to enter a diversion program to resolve the charge on July 14, 2020.
