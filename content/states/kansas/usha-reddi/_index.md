Usha L. Reddi, born in 1965 in Rajahmundry, India, is an American politician and educator who is a Democratic member of the Kansas Senate for the 22nd district. She assumed office on January 11, 2023, succeeding Tom Hawk.

Reddi immigrated to the U.S. in 1973 and moved to Manhattan, Kansas in 1992. She holds two bachelor's degrees, one in developmental psychology from the Ohio State University and the other in elementary education from Kansas State University. She also holds a master's degree in educational leadership from Kansas State University.

Before her political career, Reddi was a long-time educator in Manhattan-Ogden public schools, where she served a term as President of their National Education Association chapter.

In 2012, she ran for Manhattan city commission, coming in second place. She served as a city commissioner and mayor for the city of Manhattan, Kansas from 2013 to 2023.

In 2020, Reddi unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate, seeking to become the first Indian-American Senator from Kansas. Following Senator Tom Hawk's resignation, Reddi was elected to the Kansas Senate by the Democratic precinct chairs in the district. She was chosen over Riley County Democratic Party Chair Katie Allen by a vote of 23 to 19.

As of now, Reddi is running for re-election to the Kansas State Senate to represent District 22. She declared candidacy for the Democratic primary scheduled on August 6, 2024.
