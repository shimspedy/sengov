Leah Howell is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Kansas House of Representatives for the 82nd district. She is a member of the Republican Party and hails from Sedgwick County, Kansas.

Howell's political career began when she was elected by Republican precinct committee members to serve as a temporary replacement for Blake Carpenter in the 81st district. Carpenter had taken a leave of absence during the 2022 legislative session due to military obligations related to his role as an officer in the Kansas Air National Guard. Howell served the duration of Carpenter's leave of absence, which lasted the length of the 2022 legislative session. Carpenter reassumed his legislative duties at the end of his military service.

In 2022, Howell ran for election in her own right in the 82nd House district. She won the election, beating Democrat Misti Hobbs by a 65% to 35% margin. Howell assumed office on January 9, 2023.

Leah Howell is married to Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell, who preceded Carpenter in the Kansas Legislature. They have five children together.

During her tenure, Howell has been assigned to several committees, including Federal and State Affairs, Corrections and Juvenile Justice, and Elections. Her work in these committees reflects her commitment to serving her constituents and making a positive impact on the state of Kansas.
