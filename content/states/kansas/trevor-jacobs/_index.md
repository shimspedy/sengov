Trevor Jacobs, born on July 25, 1976, is an American politician who has been serving in the Kansas House of Representatives from the 4th district since 2017. He is a member of the Republican party and resides in Fort Scott, Kansas, U.S.

In addition to his political career, Jacobs is also a rancher. He has a Bible outreach ministry with Jesus Saves Ministry and preaches on the radio and elsewhere. He has been described as a far-right conservative, having introduced a bill that would ban abortions in Kansas, criminalizing it with the same penalty as murder.

Jacobs has sponsored several bills during his tenure, including bills authorizing the over-the-counter purchase of ivermectin tablets and hydroxychloroquine tablets, repealing the zoning and planning authority for cities in the three-mile area extending from the city boundaries, and prohibiting abortion procedures except when necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman.

Outside of his political career, Jacobs works for BNSF Railway and preaches on two radio stations for Jesus Saves Ministries. He was first elected to the Kansas State House of Representatives in 2016 and was re-elected to the seat in 2018.
