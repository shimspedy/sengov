Carolyn McGinn, born on January 27, 1959, is a Republican member of the Kansas Senate, representing the 31st district since 2005. She was previously a Commissioner on the Sedgwick County Commission.

McGinn has served on several legislative committees, including the Joint Committee on Energy and Environmental Policy, Natural Resources, Joint Committee on Home and Community Based Services Oversight, Ways and Means, Joint Committee on Kansas Security, Local Government, Calendar and Rules, and Utilities.

She has been recognized for her contributions to energy and natural resources interests, which were her largest donor group. In 2012, she was the only moderate state senate Republican to escape defeat in the Republican primary, which allowed incumbent Governor Sam Brownback to restructure state taxation.

McGinn is a 4th generation resident of the 31st District. She graduated from Valley Center High School and achieved a business degree from Wichita State University before earning a Master's Degree in Environmental Studies from Friends University.

Carolyn lives with her husband Mark on a family farm outside the town of Sedgwick where they raised two sons. After Mark retired from his 32 year career as an Engineer at Cessna, he and Carolyn have diversified their traditional grain operation by adding a grape vineyard and a hoop house for raising greens. They have also added chickens and Katahdin sheep and hope to continue expanding into food production for fresh markets.

Carolyn first became active in local politics through grassroots landowners' rights advocacy and Sedgwick Public Schools, where her children attended. She ran for and won a seat on the Sedgwick County Commission in 1998 and was re-elected in 2002. She was elected to the Kansas Senate in 2004.
