Essex has also served as the president of the Sunflower Club, as a Kansas Republican Party Precinct Committeewoman, and on the city council of Olathe, Kansas. Her dedication to public service and her community eventually led her to run for a seat in the Kansas House of Representatives.

In the general election on November 8, 2022, Essex ran for election to the Kansas House of Representatives to represent District 78. She won the election and assumed office on January 9, 2023. Her current term ends on January 13, 2025.

Throughout her political career, Essex has shown a commitment to serving her constituents and making a positive impact in her community. Her work in the Kansas House of Representatives continues to reflect this commitment.
