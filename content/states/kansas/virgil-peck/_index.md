Virgil Peck Jr. was born on August 21, 1959, in Wichita, Kansas. He is a proud country boy and a lifelong Kansan. In 1977, he married his high school sweetheart, Tamara, which he often cites as one of the best decisions of his life.

Peck's political career began when he ran for the Kansas State Senate to represent District 15 in 2000, and later for House district 11 in 2002. However, it wasn't until 2005 that he was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives, representing the 12th district (southeast Kansas, Montgomery County). He served in this position until 2013.

During his tenure in the House of Representatives, Peck held several key positions. He was the chairman of the Kansas House Transportation and Public Safety Budget Committees and the Republican Majority Caucus Chairman.

In 2021, Peck assumed office as a member of the Kansas State Senate, representing District 15. His current term is set to end on January 13, 2025.

Peck identifies as "Pro-Low Taxes, Pro-Life, Pro-Education, Pro-Business, Pro-Agriculture," and "Pro- 2nd Amendment." He believes in addressing property tax relief, immigration reform, health care costs, state debt, and bringing state government spending under control.

In the 2013 legislative session, Peck introduced a bill to raise lawmakers' pay by $10,000. The bill, however, failed to receive substantial support.

Peck's career outside of politics includes working as a self-employed insurance agent. He continues to reside in Tyro, Kansas, with his wife, Tamara.
