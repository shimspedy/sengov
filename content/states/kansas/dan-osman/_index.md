Dan Osman is an American politician and attorney who currently serves as a member of the Kansas House of Representatives, representing the 48th district in Johnson County, Kansas. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Osman's journey into politics began when he was elected by Democratic Party committee members in the 48th district on July 7, 2021. He was chosen to complete the term of former Representative Jennifer Day, who resigned in June 2021. His current term is set to end on January 13, 2025.

Before his political career, Osman earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He later pursued law and graduated from the University of Kansas School of Law. His career experience includes working as an attorney and as a school board director of Hickman Mills School District.

In addition to his role as a representative, Osman has also served on the Hickman Mills Board of Education in Kansas City, Missouri, including as vice president of the board. He was previously a prosecutor in Jackson County, Missouri.

Despite his successful career in law and education, Osman's political ambitions were not limited to the state legislature. He unsuccessfully sought a seat on the Overland Park City Council in 2019.

Osman ran for re-election to the Kansas House of Representatives to represent District 48 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. He continues to serve his constituents with dedication and commitment, striving to make a positive impact in his community and the state of Kansas.
