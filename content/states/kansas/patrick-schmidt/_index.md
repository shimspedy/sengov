Senator Patrick Schmidt represents the 19th District in the Kansas State Senate, which includes Lecompton and parts of northwestern Lawrence and Douglas County. He was elected to the Kansas Senate in November 2024 and assumed office on January 13, 2025. His current term ends on January 8, 2029.

Patrick grew up in a family deeply rooted in Kansas values, shaped by six generations of farmers, miners, and teachers. Both of his parents were public school teachers who worked second jobs to make ends meet—his mother in retail and his father in custom harvesting and later tutoring. Despite financial challenges, his parents prioritized family, making time for activities like hunting, fishing, Boy Scouts, Eagle Scouts, baseball, and track.

After graduating from Tufts University in 2013, Patrick was commissioned as a Naval Intelligence Officer. He served on the USS Ronald Reagan, supporting the battle group’s intelligence team in defending U.S. interests from China and Russia. Patrick recently transitioned to the Naval Reserve and returned to Kansas with his wife, Megan.

As a senator, Patrick is a member of several committees, including the Senate Transportation, Government Efficiency, and Judiciary committees. He also serves on the Joint Committee on Information Technology, the Joint Committee on Kansas Security, and the Joint Committee on State Building Construction. Patrick is committed to helping hard-working families like his own who struggle to make ends meet. He is guided by the family values he learned from his parents and the generations of Kansans who came before him as he works to restore common sense to the Kansas Legislature.

Patrick has sponsored several bills and resolutions, including those focused on property tax exemptions, paid prenatal personal leave, and increasing the minimum wage. He is dedicated to serving his constituents and making a positive impact on the lives of Kansans.
