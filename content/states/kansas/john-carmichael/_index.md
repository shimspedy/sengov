John Carmichael, born on July 2, 1957, is an American politician who has been serving as a Democratic member for the 92nd district in the Kansas House of Representatives since 2013. He was born in Wichita, Kansas, and continues to reside in Riverside, Kansas.

Carmichael is a well-educated individual, having earned degrees from Wichita State University and the University of Kansas law school. His commitment to public service was recognized early on when he was appointed to the Governorâ€™s Committee on Kansas Libraries by Governor Joan Finney.

In addition to his political career, Carmichael practices law in Wichita, a city in Southcentral Kansas. He has held a number of civic positions including serving as the former chair of the Kansas Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, the former State Secretary, Kansas Democratic Party, the former chair of the Kansas Fourth Congressional District Democrats, the former chair of the Kansas Human Rights Commission. In 2006, he founded the Sedgwick County Voter Protection Poll Monitoring Program. He is also an adjunct member of the faculty of Wichita State University.

During his tenure, Carmichael has been known for his outspokenness. When the Republican supermajority houses of the legislature passed a billion-dollar tax exemption for an unnamed corporation in an unrevealed industry, Carmichael's facetious comment was that for all the legislature and public knew, the state might be subsidizing "a pornographic film production studio" and roles for adult-film actors and camera crews. He continued, "The problem is, you don't know what kind of business you are betting your constituents' tax dollars and futures on."

Carmichael has served on several House Committees, including the Administrative Rules and Regulations Committee, Corrections and Juvenile Justice Committee, Energy, Utilities, and Telecommunications Committee, and the House Judiciary Committee.

In terms of elections, Carmichael has had a successful run. In 2014, he was unopposed in his primary and won the general election in House District 92 with 53.8% of the vote against Republican Jeremy Alessi. In 2016 and 2018, he won uncontested Democratic primary and general elections in the same district, without opposition. In 2020 he was again unopposed in the primary, and won the general election with 57.6% of the vote against Republican Patrick Mahoney. In 2022 he was again unopposed in both the primary and the general election.

John Carmichael lives in the Riverside district of Wichita, Kansas, in Sedgwick County, Kansas.
