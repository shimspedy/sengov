Before his election, Titus served as Chief Counsel to the Kansas Department of Agriculture, working with stakeholders in the stateâ€™s largest industry. He is considered one of the state's top water law experts. Prior to that, he worked in the Office of the Kansas Attorney General under Derek Schmidt.

In addition to his political career, Titus has also worked as corporate counsel with Foley Equipment, an adjunct professor with the University of Kansas School of Law, and the chief legal counsel with the Kansas Department of Agriculture.
