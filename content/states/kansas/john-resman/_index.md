John Resman (born April 4, 1955) is an American politician. He has served as a Republican member for the 121st district in the Kansas House of Representatives since 2017.

Personal Details:
Born on April 4, 1955, in Passaic, New Jersey, U.S., John Resman is affiliated with the Republican Party. He is married to Elizabeth and resides in Olathe. He is a retired deputy sheriff.

Early Life:
Resman attended high school and college in New Jersey prior to joining the United States Army in 1976. During his Army service, he was stationed at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, as a military policeman/corrections specialist. Following active military service, he became a Correctional Officer with the Federal Bureau of Prisons at the U. S. Penitentiary, Leavenworth, and two years later transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution at Otisville, NY.

Law Enforcement Career:
In November 1982, Resman returned to Kansas and began a career with the Johnson County Sheriffâ€™s Office. He served 28 years with the sheriff's office, retiring as a Captain in 2010. During his retirement, Resman ran for the office of Johnson County Sheriff in 2016.

Kansas House of Representatives:
In February 2017, Resman was chosen by Republican Precinct Committee Members to succeed Representative Mike Kiegerl, who announced his resignation from the Kansas House of Representatives due to health reasons. Resman stated early in his tenure that "every tax dollar sent to Topeka should be spent wisely and efficiently". Just a week after taking office, he was in an extreme minority of the legislature and his own party in voting to sustain Governor Sam Brownback's veto of a tax bill that the Legislature passed to raise funds to cover the state's $1 billion budget deficit.

Medicaid Expansion:
As of 2022, Kansas was one of 12 states that has not passed Medicaid expansion, though it remains a measure that a large majority of Kansans support.
