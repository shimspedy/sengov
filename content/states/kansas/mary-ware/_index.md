Mary Anita Ware, born on November 3, 1951, is an American politician, social justice activist, and businesswoman. She is currently serving as a member of the Kansas Senate for the 25th Senate district in Wichita, Kansas.

Ware's political journey began when she was elected to the Senate in December 2018 by Democratic Party precinct committee members. She succeeded Democrat Lynn Rogers, who stepped down to become lieutenant governor of Kansas. In 2020, Ware was elected to a full term in her own right, defeating Republican Vail Fruechting by a margin of 55% to 45% in the general election.

Apart from her political career, Ware is also a businesswoman. She owns a CBD store, American Shaman Botanicals, in Wichita. Her commitment to her work extends beyond her business and political career. In 2023, she was assigned to several Kansas Senate Committees, including Agriculture and Natural Resources (as the ranking minority member), Joint Committee on Kansas Security, Legislative Post Audit Committee - 2021, Special Committee on Federal 340B Drug Program 2022, and Special Committee on Water.

As a lifelong Wichitan, Ware is committed to pragmatic policies that strengthen the community of Wichita - the largest city in Kansas. It is her great honor to represent District 25 in the Kansas Senate. Her district is one of the most diverse in the entire state, stretching from Mount Vernon and Hillside over to Orchard Park, and up through Riverside and Benjamin Hills.

Ware's core belief is in the common bond of all people, and she stands in her office with the sole purpose of working for legislation that reflects the needs and addresses the concerns of each and every one of her fellow residents in this district. By sharing varied stories, she believes that shared experiences can be found that will allow for the creation of a full and safe future for children and for all of the generations to follow.

Her goal in serving as a senator is to preserve the strengths of the neighborhoods and to carefully examine the new challenges as they are presented. Only by thinking, talking, and working together can changes be crafted that will ensure continued dignity and prosperity for Wichita and for Kansas.
