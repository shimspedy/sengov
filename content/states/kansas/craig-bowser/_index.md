Senator Craig Bowser is a dedicated public servant representing District 1 in the Kansas State Senate. Born in Warrensburg, Missouri, Craig Bowser has a rich background that combines military service, education, and a commitment to his community. Raised on a ranch near Holton, Kansas, he is a fifth-generation Kansan. His mother, a single mom of four, instilled in him the values of education and perseverance as she earned her master’s degree in education while raising her family.

After graduating from Holton High School, Craig pursued higher education, earning a bachelor’s degree from Emporia State University and an MBA from Washburn University in Topeka. His thirst for knowledge didn’t stop there; he later earned a Ph.D. in strategic security from Henley Putnam University.

Craig Bowser’s military career is equally impressive. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1991 to 2015, completing multiple combat tours in Iraq. As a civil affairs officer, he worked closely with political leaders and citizen groups, playing a crucial role in establishing freedom and democracy. Notably, he helped facilitate the first free elections in Iraq in 2005 and was awarded the prestigious Meritorious Honor Award from the U.S. Department of State.

In addition to his military service, Craig has held leadership positions in various industries, including transportation, utilities, nuclear, government, and agriculture. His diverse professional background has equipped him with a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing Kansas.

In 2018, Kansas Governor Jeff Colyer appointed Craig to the statewide Commission on Emergency Planning and Response. He also completed the Kansas Republican Leadership Series in 2019, further solidifying his commitment to public service.

Today, Senator Bowser serves on several key committees in the Kansas State Senate, including the Senate Select Committee on Veterans Affairs, the Joint Committee on State-Tribal Relations, the Judiciary Committee, the Utilities Committee, the Local Government, Transparency and Ethics Committee, and the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee. His legislative efforts focus on a wide range of issues, from property tax exemptions to investments in bitcoin exchange-traded products.

Craig Bowser lives on a farm near Holton with his wife, Erin. He continues to work for the State of Kansas as an information security officer in Topeka, balancing his professional responsibilities with his dedication to serving his constituents in the Kansas State Senate.
