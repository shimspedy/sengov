Larry Alley, born on September 23, 1948, is an American politician who has been serving in the Kansas Senate from the 32nd district since 2017. He was born in Douglass, Kansas, U.S. and is a member of the Republican Party. He is married to Sondra and they have two children.

Alley is an alumnus of Pittsburg State University where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree. Before entering politics, he worked as a small business owner.

In the Kansas Senate, Alley assumed office on January 9, 2017. His current term ends on January 13, 2025. He ran for re-election to the Kansas State Senate to represent District 32 and won in the general election on November 3, 2020.

Following the removal of Gene Suellentrop from the office of Majority Leader on April 9, 2021, Alley, who was the Republican Assistant Leader, succeeded him in an acting capacity. The Republican caucus elected him permanent majority leader at the end of the 2021 legislative session. Alley indicated his priority was focused on redistricting.

Over the years, Alley has been assigned to various committees. In the 2023-2024 tenure, he was assigned to the Confirmation Oversight Committee (Chair), Senate Interstate Cooperation Committee, Organization, Calendar and Rules Committee, Ways and Means Committee, State-Tribal Relations Committee (Chair), and the Legislative Coordinating Council Committee.

Alley's professional experience and his contributions to the Kansas Senate have made him a significant figure in Kansas politics.
