Marvin S. Robinson II is an American politician who has been serving in the Kansas House of Representatives since 2023. He represents the 35th district. Before his political career, Robinson graduated from Sumner High School and attended Emporia State University and Temple University, although he did not complete his college education.

Robinson served in the United States Navy as an operations specialist and was honorably discharged. After his military service, he worked for organizations in Wyandotte County, Kansas that serve underprivileged minority groups. He has been a strong advocate for the preservation and study of the Quindaro Townsite.

In 2022, Robinson was elected to represent District 35 of the Kansas House of Representatives. He succeeded his first cousin, Broderick Henderson. Despite being a Democrat, he has voted with Republicans on a number of issues, overriding governor Laura Kelly's vetos. In 2023, Robinson broke ranks with his party to provide the single Democratic vote needed to override a veto and pass into law bills to restrict transgender rights, abortion access, and access to food stamps. Many within his party accused him of siding with the Republicans in exchange for $250,000 of state funding to restore a historic gazebo.

Robinson's contact information at the Capitol Office is Room: 451-S, Seat: 54, Phone: 785 296-8763, Email: Marvin.Robinson@house.ks.gov. His home address is 713 Lafayette Kansas City, KS 66101 and his home email is marvin.robinson@house.ks.gov.
