On the personal front, Howerton is married to Con Howerton, a pastor and veteran of the United States Air Force who served in the Gulf War. They are parents to four children.

In addition to her political career, Howerton is also known for her contributions to the community. She is a resident of Wichita, Kansas, U.S., where she is actively involved in various community service activities.
