Ford Carr is a member of the Democratic Party and a representative of District 84 in the Kansas House of Representatives. He assumed office on September 20, 2022, and his current term is set to end on January 13, 2025.

Carr ran for re-election to the Kansas House of Representatives to represent District 84 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. Prior to this, Democratic precinct leaders appointed Carr to the Kansas House of Representatives District 84 on September 13, 2022, to replace Gail Finney.

In terms of his educational background, Carr is a graduate of Wichita East High School. He earned a bachelor’s degree in business quality management and a master’s in leadership from Southwestern College. He has been working in the aircraft industry since 1996 and was a manager at the Boeing Company within a year of being hired.

During his tenure, Carr has been assigned to several committees, including Transportation and Public Safety Budget, Welfare Reform, Child Welfare and Foster Care, and the 2023 Special Committee on Civil Asset Forfeiture.

Carr has sponsored numerous bills during his time in office. Some of these include HB2162, which provides for a sales tax exemption for hygiene products, HB2341, which declares Juneteenth National Independence Day to be a legal public holiday and closes state offices for certain legal public holidays, and HB2363, which releases any person convicted of a drug offense involving marijuana from such person's sentence and provides for the expungement of any associated records.

Carr's commitment to his role and his contributions to the Kansas House of Representatives have been significant, and he continues to serve his constituents with dedication and integrity.
