Beverly Gossage, born on May 22, 1950, in Wichita, Kansas, is an American politician, insurance agent, and former educator. She is currently serving as a member of the Kansas Senate representing the 9th district in Johnson County, Kansas. A Republican, she was elected in 2020 to succeed retiring senator Julia Lynn.

Gossage was born to Calvin and LaVaughn Kastl. She earned an associate's degree from Fort Scott Community College and holds a bachelor's degree in education from Central Missouri State University.

Before her political career, Gossage worked for eight years as an elementary school teacher. She also worked at Sylvan Learning. Gossage founded HSA Benefits Consulting, a firm that consults with businesses and individuals regarding health savings accounts. She specialized in consumer-driven health plans. She has also served as a consultant with the Show-Me Institute, a conservative think tank based in Missouri.

Gossage is a Republican and has described herself as a "free-market conservative" and a "Tea Party grassroots activist". Gossage was appointed as an alternate delegate to the 2012 Republican Convention. The following year, she was appointed as a State Delegate for the Kansas Republican Party. In 2014, she ran for Kansas Insurance Commissioner. She was unsuccessful in winning the Republican nomination, coming in second place at the primary election. During her campaign, she received endorsements from Newt Gingrich and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, as well as several Kansas State Representatives, including Willie Dove, Owen Donohoe, and Amanda Grosserode. During the 2016 Presidential election, Gossage again served as a Republican delegate. During the race, she supported Ted Cruz.

Gossage was nominated by Republican precinct members in Kansas's 9th district, and ran against Democrat Stacey Knoell in the 2020 Kansas Senate election. Her hastened campaign preceded a last-minute drop-out; incumbent senator Julia Lynn withdrew her campaign due to a family emergency in early September. For the 2021â€“2022 legislative session, Gossage was appointed Vice Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Public Health and Welfare. Additionally, she received the following Senate Committee assignments: Financial Institutions and Insurance Judiciary Education Robert G. (Bob) Bethell Joint Committee on Home and Community Based Services and KanCare Oversight.

Gossage married Robert Gossage in 1969, and they have four children.
