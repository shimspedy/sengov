Rick Kloos is a Republican member of the Kansas Senate, representing the 19th district. The district covers Topeka and eastern Shawnee County, western Douglas County, and all of Osage County and Jefferson County. He assumed office on January 11, 2021.

Born as Richard Gene Kloos on July 26, 1966, in Miltonvale, Kansas, U.S., Rick Kloos has been a significant figure in Kansas politics. He defeated Anthony Hensley, who had been holding office in the Kansas statehouse for 44 years, by 51.2% to 48.8% on November 3, 2020. This victory was considered a huge upset victory.

Before his political career, Rick started God's Storehouse in Topeka, Kansas, in June 2009. It's a church that operates a non-profit, community thrift store with over 80 employees.

In 2018, Kloos ran as an Independent for governor, on a ticket with his son, Nathaniel, running for lieutenant governor. They finished last, in 5th place in the general election, with 6,584 votes, 0.6% of the total.

During the 2020 Kansas 19th Senate district campaign, Kloos ran unchallenged in the GOP primary; however, he received 6,758 in the primary. He beat Anthony Hensley 16,141 votes to 15,383 votes, 51% to 49%, in the November 3, 2020 general election.

Kloos opposes abortion and was endorsed by Kansans for Life. The Kloos campaign outraised Hensley $37,433 to $1,286.

On a personal note, Kloos and his wife Pennie have been married for 34 years and have lived in Berryton, Kansas for 22 years. They have four grown boys, along with seven grandchildren.
