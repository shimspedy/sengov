Rick Kloos, born on July 26, 1966, in Miltonvale, Kansas, is a Republican member of the Kansas Senate, representing the 19th district. This district covers Topeka and eastern Shawnee County, western Douglas County, and all of Osage County and Jefferson County. Kloos assumed office on January 11, 2021, succeeding Anthony Hensley, who had held the position for 44 years.

Kloos's journey into politics is marked by his dedication to community service and his entrepreneurial spirit. In June 2009, he founded God's Storehouse in Topeka, Kansas, a non-profit community thrift store that has grown to employ over 80 people. This venture reflects his commitment to supporting his community and providing opportunities for those in need.

In 2018, Kloos ran as an Independent candidate for governor of Kansas, with his son Nathaniel as his running mate for lieutenant governor. Although they finished last in the general election, their campaign demonstrated Kloos's determination to bring change to Kansas politics.

Kloos's political career took a significant turn in 2020 when he ran unchallenged in the GOP primary for the Kansas Senate's 19th district. In the general election held on November 3, 2020, he achieved a remarkable victory by defeating Anthony Hensley with 51.2% of the vote. This victory was considered a major upset, as Hensley had a much larger campaign budget and had represented the area for over four decades.

As a senator, Kloos has been an advocate for various causes, including opposition to abortion, for which he received an endorsement from Kansans for Life. He has also been actively involved in several committees, including the Joint Committee on State Building Construction, the Transportation Committee, and the Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee.

Kloos and his wife, Pennie, have been married for 34 years and have lived in Berryton, Kansas, for 22 years. They have four grown sons and seven grandchildren, reflecting the importance of family in Kloos's life.

Throughout his career, Rick Kloos has demonstrated a strong commitment to his community, a willingness to challenge the status quo, and a dedication to public service. His journey from founding a thrift store to serving in the Kansas Senate is a testament to his determination and passion for making a positive impact on the lives of Kansans.
