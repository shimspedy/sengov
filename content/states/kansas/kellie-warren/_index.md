Kellie K. Warren, born on February 18, 1969, is an American politician from the state of Kansas and a former real estate attorney. She is a member of the Republican Party.

Warren serves as a member of the Kansas Senate, representing the 11th District. She has also represented the 28th district in the Kansas House of Representatives, which is based in eastern Johnson County.

Before her political career, Warren worked as an attorney at Shook, Hardy, and Bacon from 2006 until 2013, and at the Property Law Firm from 2013 onwards. Her political career began in 2018 when she challenged moderate Republican State Representative Joy Koesten in the Republican primary for the 28th district. Warren won the primary election with 58% of the votes and defeated Democrat Brian Clausen in November.

In 2020, Warren announced a primary challenge to State Senator John Skubal in the Senate's 11th district, an election she won with 64% of the votes. Warren faced Koesten, now a Democrat, in the competitive general election for the seat, defeating her with 53% of the votes.

In 2022, Warren ran unsuccessfully for Kansas Attorney General, narrowly losing in the Republican primary to Kris Kobach.

On a personal note, Warren lives in Leawood with her husband and their four children. She graduated from Shawnee Mission South High School in 1987, earned a degree in government from Cornell University in 1991, and a J.D. from the University of Kansas in 1994.
