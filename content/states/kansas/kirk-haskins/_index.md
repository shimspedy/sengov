Kirk Haskins is a member of the Democratic Party and represents District 53 in the Kansas House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 9, 2023, and his current term ends on January 13, 2025. He ran for election to the Kansas House of Representatives to represent District 53 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Kirk Haskins is a fourth-generation Kansan and lifelong Topekan who has resided in the 53rd District for more than 20 years. The son of an educator and a Kansas state employee, Kirk’s roots grew from Kansas farm families outside Lindsborg and Vermillion. He had a Topeka public school education and holds a B.A. from Washburn University, an M.B.A. from Wichita State University, and an Ed.D. in Higher Education Administration from the University of Kansas.

Kirk’s three children attend Kansas public schools and his oldest child will attend the University of Kansas in the Fall. His partner in life lives in Emporia with her daughter and this blended family of six enjoys movie time, disc golf, family cookouts, road-trip karaoke, and epic board game nights.

As an educator, business executive, and father, Kirk is passionate about issues that impact all Kansans. The pillars of his campaign - Education, Equity, and the Economy - are based on his personal experiences that drive his passion to serve Kansas. He strongly believes in public education and the autonomy of local educational agencies. He will work to champion affordable, quality healthcare, including mental healthcare, for all Kansans and he has the business background needed to help keep the Kansas economy strong.

His experiences in business entrepreneur leadership, banking retail services, and as a manager and administrator in both the public and private sectors bring a wealth of knowledge in service to the Kansas economy. Kirk’s passion for teaching has brought him to an Associate Professorship and Chair of Graduate Studies for the School of Professional and Graduate Studies at Baker University. He is engaged in program and curriculum development as well as supporting faculty and students.

He was formerly the Senior Vice President for Retail Operations for CoreFirst Bank and Trust. Kirk has also been the Business Education Consultant for the Kansas State Department of Education. In that role, he traveled the state working with secondary business educators to develop instructional objectives that met both Federal and State business education curriculum standards. Prior to 7 years working as Director of Admission for Washburn University, Kirk was the Program Director for Youth Entrepreneurs of Kansas, a non-profit agency with a mission to inspire high school students to become business entrepreneurs.

While Kirk was writing his doctoral dissertation he worked at Jardine Elementary in USD501 as a building substitute for more than a year. He spent most days supporting students in the JAG program, which gave him a profound appreciation for the work of public educators, social case workers, and mental health professionals who serve to meet the needs of students with significant trauma backgrounds. This first-hand knowledge and experience will inform his service to education in the legislature with the empathy, compassion, and trust that educators know students need to be ready to learn.
