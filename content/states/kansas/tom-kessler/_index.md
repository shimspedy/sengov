Tom Kessler is an American politician who has been serving as a Republican member for the 96th district of the Kansas House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 11, 2021.

In the 2021 elections, Kessler won the seat for the 96th district of the Kansas House of Representatives against Stephanie Yeager, securing 53.3% of the vote. His victory marked the beginning of his political journey in the Kansas House of Representatives.

Before his political career, Kessler was a business owner. He owned and operated a liquor store named Tom's Wine & Spirits. His experience in business provided him with insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by small businesses, which he could bring to his role in the legislature.

In the 2023 elections, Kessler ran unopposed and was re-elected to his position. His re-election demonstrated the trust and confidence that the constituents of the 96th district had in his leadership and representation.

As a legislator, Kessler has been assigned to several committees. In the 2023-2024 term, he served on the Commerce, Labor and Economic Development Committee, the House Federal and State Affairs Committee, where he was the Vice Chair, and the Taxation Committee. In the previous term (2021-2022), he was assigned to the Taxation Committee, Commerce, Labor and Economic Development Committee, Energy, Utilities, and Telecommunications Committee, and the Financial Institutions and Rural Development Committee.

Throughout his tenure, Kessler has been dedicated to serving his constituents and making a positive impact in his district and the state of Kansas. His current term ends on January 13, 2025.
