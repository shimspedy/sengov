Cindy Holscher is an American politician who has been serving in the Kansas Senate from the 8th district since January 11, 2021. She was born on April 26, 1969, in Slater, Missouri, U.S. and currently resides in Overland Park, Kansas.

Before her tenure in the Senate, she served in the Kansas House of Representatives from the 16th district from January 9, 2017, to January 11, 2021. She succeeded Amanda Grosserode and was succeeded by Linda Featherston in this role.

In 2016, Holscher ran for election to represent District 16 in the Kansas House of Representatives and defeated the Republican incumbent, Amanda Grosserode. She won re-election in 2018. Holscher was elected to represent district 8 in the Kansas Senate on November 3, 2020.

Holscher graduated from Slater High School in 1987. She earned degrees in journalism, marketing, and political science from the University of Missouri in 1992. Her career experience includes working with R.H. Donnelley, The Add Sheet, and Sprint.

Throughout her political career, Holscher has been assigned to various committees. In the 2023-2024 term, she was assigned to the Senate Federal and State Affairs Committee, Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee, Senate Interstate Cooperation Committee, Public Health and Welfare Committee, Child Welfare System Oversight, and Pensions, Investments and Benefits Committee.

Holscher's political journey has been marked by her fight for fully-funded public schools, access to affordable healthcare, domestic violence reform, and commonsense policies that keep Kansas moving forward.
