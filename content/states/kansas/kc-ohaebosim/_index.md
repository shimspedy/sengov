KC Ohaebosim is a Nigerian-American politician who has been serving as a Democratic member for the 89th district in the Kansas House of Representatives since 2017. He was born on December 27, 1978, in Owerri, Nigeria.

Before his political career, Ohaebosim had a diverse professional background. He worked as a client services representative with CCH Tax and Accounting, a chief consultant with Ohams Industry Limited Liability Corporation, a tech support representative with Honeywell/Westar Energy, a computer/electronics support analyst with Integra Technologies Limited Liability Corporation, and a data tech analyst with Engility CORP.

Ohaebosim's educational background is equally impressive. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems from Wichita State University and an MBA from Newman University. His academic and professional experiences have undoubtedly equipped him with a unique set of skills and perspectives that he brings to his role as a representative.

In his role as a representative, Ohaebosim has been assigned to several committees over the years. These include the Energy, Utilities, and Telecommunications Committee, the Social Services Budget Committee, the House Transportation Committee, and the House Judiciary Committee. His work in these committees reflects his commitment to serving his constituents and making a positive impact on his community.

Ohaebosim's dedication to public service is evident in his re-election to the Kansas House of Representatives to represent District 89. He won the general election on November 8, 2022, demonstrating the trust and confidence his constituents have in his leadership.

Currently, Ohaebosim resides in Wichita, Kansas. His journey from Nigeria to the United States, and his subsequent success in politics, is a testament to his resilience, determination, and commitment to public service.
