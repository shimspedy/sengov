Caryn Tyson, born on February 15, 1963, is a Republican member of the Kansas Senate, representing the 12th district since 2013. She succeeded Republican Senator Pat Apple, who chose to run in the newly redistricted 37th district, winning that seat. Before her time in the Senate, she was a member of the Kansas House of Representatives, representing District 4 from 2011 to 2013.

Tyson is a fifth-generation Kansan from Parker, Kansas. She earned two Bachelor of Science degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from Kansas State University before completing a Master of Science in Engineering Management from the University of Kansas. Before her time in the public sphere, she worked in the IT field for over 24 years. Her work included space shuttle support for NASA.

In addition to her work in the Senate, Tyson was a Republican candidate for Kansas's 2nd congressional district. In a crowded field, she finished a close second to the eventual general election winner, Steve Watkins.

As a member of the Kansas Senate, Tyson served on a number of committees. She served as the Chair of the Assessment and Taxation Committee. Other committees she served on include Federal and State Affairs, Transportation, Ways and Means, Education, and Natural Resources.

Tyson is known for her conservative values, a diverse background, and real-world experience. Her deep-seated Kansas values stem from working in her youth with family and friends at the Glasco Locker Plant, her parentsâ€™ family business. Caryn and Tim, her husband of 34 years, are fifth-generation Kansans who co-own Tyson Ranch.
