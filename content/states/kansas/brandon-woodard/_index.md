Nursing his passion for civic engagement, Brandon was a part of multiple public service clubs in college and was elected Student Body Vice President.

His career experience includes working as the manager of philanthropic giving with the KC CARE Health Center, the associate development director of KU (University of Kansas) Endowment, and an alumni relations specialist with the University of Kansas. Woodard has served on the boards of the Johnson County Pride Association and the Johnson County Educational Research Triangle.

In the 2023-2024 tenure, Woodard was assigned to the following committees: Appropriations Committee, Elections Committee, Higher Education Budget Committee, and Insurance Committee. He has also served on the Taxation Committee, Calendar and Printing Committee, House Federal and State Affairs Committee, and was the Ranking Minority Member of the Higher Education Budget Committee in the 2021-2022 tenure.
