Brenda Landwehr was born on March 8, 1955, in Wichita, Kansas, U.S. She is a member of the Republican Party and has been serving as a member of the Kansas House of Representatives.

Landwehr's political career began when she was elected to represent the 91st district in the Kansas House of Representatives in 1994. She served in this position from January 9, 1995, to January 14, 2013. During her tenure, she was known for her work on various committees, including the Education Budget Committee, Health Policy Oversight Committee, and the Health and Human Services Committee, which she chaired.

In 2011, Landwehr announced that she would not run for re-election to the Kansas House but would instead seek election to the Kansas Senate in District 25. However, she lost her state senate bid and then ran and lost a bid for District 92's Kansas House seat in 2014.

In 2016, Landwehr was elected to the District 105 seat in the Kansas House. She assumed office on January 9, 2017. Her current term ends on January 13, 2025. She has been assigned to various committees, including the Appropriations Committee, Health and Human Services Committee, and the K-12 Education Budget Committee.

Apart from her political career, Landwehr is the owner of LT Care Solutions, Inc. She is also a member of Christ the King Church, Comcare Mental Health Advisory Board, and the Salvation Army Foster Care Advisory Board.

Landwehr's dedication to public service and her contributions to the state of Kansas are commendable. Her work continues to impact the lives of the people she represents.
