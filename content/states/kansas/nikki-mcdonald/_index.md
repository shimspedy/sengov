Nikki McDonald is an American politician and community organizer who is currently serving as a state representative in the Kansas House of Representatives. She assumed office on December 21, 2023, following Brad Boyd's resignation. McDonald was elected by the local Democratic precinct committee.

Before her political career, McDonald worked as a teacher. Education issues have been a particular focus in her office. She also founded the Olathe Public Education Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates against extremism in public schools. In addition to her work in education, McDonald has worked on several political campaigns in her district, including her predecessor Brad Boyd's successful Kansas House campaign.

In her role as a state representative, McDonald has sponsored several bills and resolutions. Some of the notable ones include HB2496, which enacts the interstate compact on the agreement among the states to elect the president by national popular vote, and HB2508, which authorizes a transfer of state general fund moneys to the local ad valorem tax reduction fund in fiscal year 2025 and all fiscal years thereafter. She has also proposed a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 16 years through HCR5023.

McDonald represents District 49 and is a member of the Democratic Party. She serves on several committees, including the K-12 Education Budget, Legislative Modernization, and Health and Human Services. She is self-employed and lives in Olathe, Kansas, with her husband Patrick and their two children.
