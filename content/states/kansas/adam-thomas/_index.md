Adam Thomas is an American politician who has been a Republican member of the Kansas Senate for the 23rd district since 2025. He was born in St. Charles, Missouri, and raised in Olathe, Kansas. He attended Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. Outside of politics, Thomas works as a restaurant manager.

Thomas was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives in 2018 and assumed office in 2019, representing the 26th district. During his campaign, he faced accusations that he lived outside his district and was later charged with election perjury for giving a false address on election documents. He reached a diversionary agreement.

In the 2021â€“2022 legislative session, Thomas served as vice chair of the House Education Committee. On June 22, 2023, he filed to run for the 23rd Senate district in 2024 after Rob Olson, the Republican incumbent, opted not to seek reelection. Thomas won the general election on November 5, 2024, and assumed office on January 13, 2025.

Throughout his political career, Thomas has been involved in various committees and sponsored several bills. In the Kansas Senate, he serves on the Education Committee, Public Health and Welfare Committee, Joint Committee on Child Welfare System Oversight, Government Efficiency Committee, and Federal and State Affairs Committee. Some of the bills he has sponsored include property tax exemptions for certain personal property, imposing conditional term limits on members of the legislature, and designating Kansas as a purple heart state.

Thomas is also active in his community, having been a member of the Olathe Youth Symphony Association Board of Directors, the Lenexa Baptist Church Praise Band, and a watchdog at Heritage Elementary School. He is married to Kristin Thomas, and they have five children.
