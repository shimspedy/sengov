Brian Bergkamp is an American accountant and politician, currently serving as a member of the Kansas House of Representatives from the 93rd district. He was elected in November 2020 and assumed office on January 11, 2021.

Born and raised in Kansas, Brian grew up on a farm near Cheney Lake. He has two older sisters who are married and reside in Nebraska. His younger brother lives in Salina with his wife. His youngest sister is married and lives in Kansas City. Brian's dad stays involved in agriculture working for a local Coop, and his mom is enjoying her first year of being a retired art teacher (although still substituting!).

Brian graduated from Pretty Prairie High School in Pretty Prairie, Kansas, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from Friends University in Wichita. After graduating in 2008, he worked for Koch Industries. His experience there involved corporate taxation, logistics, fertilizer sales and project management; it even took him to Australia for 5 months in 2015.

During those years, he learned invaluable lessons in business and interacting with people across multiple industries and backgrounds. He left Koch in 2021 after being elected to the Kansas House of Representatives. He currently represents the 93rd House District covering southwest Sedgwick County.

When not working, Brian enjoys spending time with his family and participating in a wide range of hobbies. He remains involved within the Catholic Diocese of Wichita and volunteers for The Lord's Diner and other organizations. He is constantly amazed and encouraged by the generosity and hospitality of Kansans. He is proud to be a Kansan, and looks forward to contributing to its growth.
