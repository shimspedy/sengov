Stephanie Clayton, born on July 9, 1977, is a Democratic member of the Kansas House of Representatives, representing the 19th district which includes Overland Park in Johnson County. She has been serving since 2013. Initially, she was elected as a Republican, but after winning reelection on November 9, 2018, with 58.9% of the vote, she announced she was changing her party affiliation.

Stephanie is a native of Johnson County and a product of the Shawnee Mission School District. She put herself through college at Emporia State University, earning a Bachelor’s Degree in History. Following graduation, Stephanie returned to Johnson County and has lived in Overland Park since 2001.

In the legislature, Stephanie is a fierce advocate for government transparency and accountability. As a member of the Commerce, Labor, and Economic Development Committee, Stephanie understands that a strong local business community serves as a foundation for prosperity for all Kansans. She also serves on the Federal and State Affairs committee, Rules Committee, the Unemployment Compensation Modernization and Improvement Council, and the House Committee on Taxation.

Stephanie works to expand opportunities for small business owners and start-ups, and is a strong advocate for a balanced tax plan that lifts the burden especially on seniors on a fixed income, so that they can stay in their homes and have affordable groceries.

Stephanie is a proud founder and leader of the Bipartisan Women’s Caucus, which was instrumental in reversing much of Brownback’s tax policies and stabilizing the Kansas Budget, leading us to unprecedented prosperity. In her local community, Stephanie served on the Johnson County Commission on Aging since 2013. She is President of the Ambassadors Rotary Club of Western Kansas City, which is composed of members from across Johnson County. Nationally, Clayton is President of the National Council of State Legislators Women’s Legislative Network. She is a State Director for Women in Government.
