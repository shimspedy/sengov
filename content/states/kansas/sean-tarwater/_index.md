Sean E. Tarwater, Sr. was born on February 25, 1969, in Kansas City, Kansas, U.S. He is an American politician who has served in the Kansas House of Representatives from the 27th district since 2017.

Tarwater is a native Kansas Citian and a 3rd generation Kansan. His roots in the community run deep. A proud Irish Catholic, Sean grew up in a tight-knit family with three brothers and a sister. He attended St. Thomas More Grade School and graduated from Rockhurst High School in 1987. Rockhurst is a Jesuit Catholic high school. At Rockhurst, he learned to be an Ignatian leader and a “Man for Others” in the spirit of St. Ignatius Loyola. It was during those years, and through those experiences, that he knew he wanted to be a community leader that made a difference.

Sean stayed in Kansas City for college and graduated from UMKC Block School of Business with a Master’s Degree in Business. While there, he served as an officer in Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity where he was Social Chairman and helped to improve the fraternity’s reputation and relationship within the community through philanthropic events. Sean’s higher education has prepared him well for his business and volunteer life.

Sean and his wife, Lexie, live in River Ridge Farms with four sons, ages 20, 17, 15, and 12. Together, they work hard to raise the children with the same values they were raised. They have always been involved with the children’s activities and schools. In addition to the Finance Council he served on, Sean can be found volunteering at school every chance he gets. He and Lexie never miss parent teacher conferences and are very involved in the children’s education. Sean attends school masses regularly, not only to pray with his sons, but also to provide a good example for them, as his parents did for him. Sean has coached his son’s football teams for eight years.

The Tarwater family is proud to say their oldest son graduated from Blue Valley High School and is now going to KU as a Sophomore. They have two son’s that are attending Rockhurst High School and their youngest son attends St. Michael the Archangel Catholic School.

Sean has used his finance background to become a successful small business man and developed small businesses. He volunteers at his church and school, St. Michael the Archangel, in Overland Park, Kansas. Sean was on the Finance Council for three years and was elected Chairman for his final year. The Finance Council is the budgeting and finance arm of the church and school. It is charged with overseeing the revenue stream and creating a balanced budget each year. While on this council, Sean worked hard to see that education came first, while trying to ensure adequate funds for the construction of a new church. Under Sean’s watch, the school was completely funded while the ground breaking ceremony and construction of the church was on time. Sean’s experience on this council taught him the finances behind running a school and he knows what it takes to make schools successful. He will use his experience to ensure schools are funded properly and will help the school districts allocate the funds properly.

Sean Tarwater was the President of his HOA in River Ridge Farms for 5 years.

Tarwater was first elected to represent District 27 in the Kansas House of Representatives in 2016. He was re-elected in 2018 and 2020. In the 2019 session he was a member of the Appropriations Committee, the K-12 Education Budget Committee, the Pensions, Investments and Benefits Committee, and chair of the Commerce, Labor and Economic Development Committee.
