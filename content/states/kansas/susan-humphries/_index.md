Susan Humphries, born on October 31, 1957, is an American politician who has been serving in the Kansas House of Representatives from the 99th district since 2017. She was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, U.S. and is a member of the Republican party.

She started representing the 99th District of Kansas in January 2017. Her decision to serve the district was the culmination of a lifetime of organizational involvement and service. Susan received a B.F.A. from TCU, in Fort Worth, Texas, where she graduated with honors in communications with a business minor. She served as the president of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and was a member of Student Foundation, a university service organization. She and her husband Cary also helped lead a large campus Bible study.

After three years in advertising and marketing, Susan worked as a caseworker with Big Brothers Big Sisters in Wichita before transitioning to full-time homemaking for her four children. In nearly 40 years of marriage she and Cary have made three international moves, twice to Tokyo, Japan, and once to São Paulo, Brazil, where they adopted two of their children. Susan was an active Precept Inductive Bible Study leader and coached the award-winning Trinity Academy cheerleaders for six years.

Susan attended The University of Denver (DU), Sturm College of Law, from 2011 to 2014 while Cary served with a non-profit in Colorado Springs for three years. She served in DU’s Clinic for Mediation, Adoption, and Child Advocacy and graduated in the top quarter of her class. After her graduation she and Cary made the deliberate decision to return to Wichita. She was admitted to the Kansas Bar Association in 2014 and began working as an adoption attorney, advocating for children and families in need of permanence.

In early 2016 Susan felt a nudge into public service and was elected to her first term representing District 99 in November 2016. She continues to practice adoption law. Susan’s policy mindset is driven by a belief that faith, family, community, and earned success through work are the pillars of a flourishing society. She strives to work every day to foster a state where able-bodied, working-age adults have the opportunity and privilege to provide for themselves and support others voluntarily.

Susan and Cary love Kansas and have lived in Kansas for most of their adult lives. They have owned their home in the Shadybrook neighborhood since 2002, a Wichita address in the Andover School District. Two of their four adult children live in Wichita; the other two are in Texas and Colorado. They have added four wonderful members to their family in recent years: a son-in-law, a daughter-in-law, and two grandsons.
