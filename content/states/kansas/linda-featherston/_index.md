Linda Featherston is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Kansas House of Representatives, representing District 16. She was elected to the House in 2020 and has been serving the people of Kansas ever since. Linda is a lifelong Kansan and has been residing in Johnson County since 1999. She is the child of two Kansas state employees and attended Kansas public schools from kindergarten through graduate school.

Linda and her husband, Bill, chose to educate their own two children through Kansas public schools as well. This shows her commitment to the public education system of Kansas. In the House, Linda serves on the Agriculture, Education, Local Government, and Water committees. She is the ranking member on the Local Government committee.

In 2023, Linda’s bills increasing the penalty for attacking an on-duty healthcare worker and allowing for longer protection from abuse orders became law. This shows her commitment to the safety and well-being of the people of Kansas. While serving in the Legislature, she has prioritized constituent services, being a voice for children and families, and advocating for schools and Medicaid expansion.

Linda is not interested in playing political games in Topeka, but she is committed to working together to serve the state that she loves. Outside of her political career, Linda has owned and operated a successful piano studio for 30 years and is an active community volunteer. She serves on the boards of the Kansas Music Teachers Association and the Kansas City Music Teachers Association.

She volunteers in the Sunset Community Garden which provides fresh produce to those in need and with Be SMART, an educational branch of Moms Demand Action. Linda was a longtime volunteer for Girl Scouts, Shawnee Mission Schools, and her church. In her (rare!) free time, she enjoys reading, gardening, cycling and spoiling the family’s two basset hounds.

Linda has been endorsed by numerous organizations including the American Federation of Teachers, Education First Shawnee Mission, Equality Kansas, Freedom to Learn, Game on for Kansas Schools, Greater Kansas City AFL-CIO, Greater Kansas City Building and Construction Trades Council, Humane Society Legislative Fund, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Johnson County Democratic Women, KC Biz PAC, Kansas Agri Business Council, Kansas Farm Bureau, Kansas National Education Association, MainPAC, Stand Up Blue Valley, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America.

Linda Featherston is a dedicated and committed public servant who is working tirelessly for the people of Kansas. Her work in the Kansas House of Representatives is a testament to her dedication to public service and her love for the state of Kansas.
