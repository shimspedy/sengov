Senator Jeff Klemp represents District 5 in the Kansas State Senate. Raised on a small Angus farm, he learned the Kansas family values of hard work, faith, integrity, and giving back to the community. Jeff is a proud graduate of Leavenworth High School and holds a degree in Economics from the University of Kansas, as well as an MBA from Baker University.

Jeff's career spans various leadership roles in companies of all sizes. Fifteen years ago, he and his wife revitalized a distressed business, transforming it into a thriving Midwest agent and a leader in moving military families globally. Jeff's dedication to his community and his family is evident in his commitment to public service.

In the Kansas State Senate, Jeff serves on several committees, including the Senate Select Committee on Veterans Affairs, Transportation, Judiciary, Commerce, and Assessment and Taxation. He has sponsored numerous bills and resolutions, focusing on property tax exemptions, term limits for legislators, and recognizing Kansas as a Purple Heart state.

Jeff is passionate about creating opportunities for the next generation of Kansans and is determined to challenge the status quo in Topeka. He is committed to fighting for tax relief, education, and public safety for Kansas families. Jeff's deep family history in Kansas, spanning five generations, fuels his love and belief in the state.

As a dedicated husband and proud father of two girls, Jeff Klemp is ready to roll up his sleeves and take on the career politicians and special interests in Topeka. He aims to put an end to foreign adversaries influencing the state by owning land and controlling the food supply, as he believes national security depends on securing the food supply. Jeff's unwavering dedication to his community and his state makes him a strong advocate for the people of Kansas.
