Renee Kendra Erickson was born on May 23, 1964, in Newton, Kansas. She is an American school principal and politician from the state of Kansas. As a member of the Republican Party, Erickson represented the 87th district of the Kansas House of Representatives, based in eastern Wichita, from 2019 to 2020.

Erickson graduated from Newton High School. She earned a degree in business administration from Oklahoma Christian University, a degree in business education from Wichita State University, a master's degree in public school administration from Baker University, and a master's degree in family life education and consultation from Kansas State University.

Erickson's career experience includes working as a teacher, a data and assessment coordinator, a middle school principal, a financial planner, and the director of the Unified School District 259 instructional technology center.

In 2016, Erickson announced her campaign for the 31st district of the Kansas Senate, challenging incumbent Republican Carolyn McGinn from the right. Erickson narrowly lost in the primary election. Erickson ran for the state legislature again in 2018, after 87th district incumbent Roger Elliott retired. She positioned herself as the conservative in the race and defeated Jeff Kennedy in the Republican primary and was uncontested in the general election.

President of the Kansas Senate Susan Wagle announced her retirement from the 30th district in 2020, and endorsed Erickson as her successor; Erickson faced Democrat Melissa Gregory in November and defeated her. Erickson assumed office on January 11, 2021. Her current term ends on January 13, 2025.

Erickson lives in Wichita with her husband, who is also a retired school principal. They have two children and one grandchild.
