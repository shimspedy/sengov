Joseph 'Joe' C. Perry, an accomplished American businessperson and politician hailing from Maine, has made significant contributions to the political landscape. As a Democrat, Perry represented District 32 in the Maine Senate, encompassing his hometown of Bangor and Hermon. His political journey began with a successful eight-year stint (1996-2004) in the Maine House of Representatives, representing a portion of Bangor. In 2004, Perry transitioned to the Maine Senate, securing victory over incumbent Republican Senator Tom Sawyer by a margin of 280 votes.

During the 124th legislature (2008-2010), Perry assumed the crucial role of Senate Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation, showcasing his commitment to addressing fiscal matters. Despite facing a defeat in the 2010 re-election bid for District 32, Perry remained active in public service.

Beyond his political endeavors, Perry expanded his impact by winning a seat on the Bangor City Council in 2015. His dedication to community service aligns with his ownership of Joe's Market in Bangor.

Perry's academic journey took him to the University of Maine at Orono, where he pursued his education from 1984 to 1988.

In a notable turn of events, Perry's resilience and community support propelled him to success in March 2019, winning a special election for the Maine House's 124th District. This election was prompted by the resignation of incumbent Democrat Aaron Frey, who assumed the role of Attorney General of Maine. Perry's victory over Republican Thomas White solidified his continued commitment to public service and advocacy.
