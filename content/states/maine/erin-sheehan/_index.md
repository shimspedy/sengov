Erin Sheehan is a member of the Democratic Party serving her second term in the Maine House of Representatives, representing District 132. She is a resident of Biddeford, Maine, and a small business owner. Along with her husband Carson, she opened a bar and retail shop in Biddeford in the summer of 2019, which is known for its welcoming and fun approach to wine service.

Before her tenure in the legislature, Erin had a career as a design professional, where she honed her skills in maintaining collegiality and focusing on shared goals, even during contentious negotiations. She holds a degree in Geography from Clark University.

Erin is also a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary and the Standing Committee of the House Bills in the Second Reading. Her work in the legislature includes involvement in a wide range of issues, from the judicial system organization and budget to civil rights and property law.

She and her husband live in one of Biddefordâ€™s historic mills with their eight-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer, Roxy. Erin is deeply committed to her community and cannot imagine living anywhere else.
