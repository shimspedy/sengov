Sen. Anne Carney lives in Cape Elizabeth, where she and her husband, David Wennberg raised their three children. Sen. Carney graduated from the University of Maine School of Law, cum laude, in 1990. Sen. Carney received a B.A. from Haverford College, and has a Masters of Theological Studies from Harvard University.

Sen. Carney practiced employment, civil rights and municipal law at Norman, Hanson & DeTroy, LLC, for 17 years, representing businesses, individuals, cities and towns throughout Maine in state and federal court litigation. She then served as In-House Volunteer Attorney with Pine Tree Legal Assistance for 8 years, providing free legal representation to low-income Mainers, fighting for people who have no access to our legal system, including women sexually assaulted at work, migrant farmworkers subjected to terrible conditions, people who lost work because of their religion or because they were pregnant. She received the Pine Tree Legal Assistance Award for Pro Bono Services in 2016.

Sen. Carney served in a leadership role in conservation in 2010, when she was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Cape Elizabeth Land Trust and helped preserve key habitat, agricultural and recreational land for the community. She served as Board President from 2014 to 2017, and led the organization to national accreditation in February 2015. Sen. Carney completed her board service in 2018.

Sen. Carney’s service as a volunteer lawyer for Mainers unable to afford legal representation and commitment to conservation and environmental protection influence her legislative work. In 2018 she was elected to the Maine House of Representatives, and served on the Labor and Housing Committee.

Sen. Carney is a member of the Children’s Caucus, the Caucus on Aging, and the Coastal and Climate Action Caucus. She has also been honored to participate in the Permanent Commission on the Status of Racial, Indigenous and Maine Tribal Populations process to combat racial disparities.
