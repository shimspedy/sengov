He is a member of the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee. Before settling in York with his wife, Michelle, who has deep family roots in Maine, Runte was raised in a career Army family and served in the Army himself. He has moved frequently due to his career in the energy industry.

Runte has been actively involved in his community, serving as a member of York’s Energy Steering Committee and Planning Board, and he chaired the York Climate Action Plan Steering Committee. His interest in contributing to the ongoing revision of Maine’s electricity regulatory structure and implementing Maine’s climate action plan is evident in his legislative focus.

He holds a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in engineering from Penn State University. Runte has four children, two of whom recently graduated from York High School. His professional background includes various roles in the energy sector, such as managing director of Worthington Sawtelle, general manager of clean energy at ARES Corporation, and executive director of hydrogen energy and alternative fuels at Gas Technology Institute. Runte’s commitment to public service and his expertise in energy and technology are assets to the Maine House of Representatives.
