Stephen Moriarty is a dedicated public servant representing Cumberland, Chebeague Island, and Long Island in the Maine House of Representatives for District 110. He is currently serving his fourth non-consecutive term and is a member of the Judiciary Committee. His commitment to public service is evident from his 21 years on the Cumberland Town Council, where he was elected council chair seven times. Additionally, he served on the Cumberland Planning Board, where he was elected chair three times.

Raised in Hallowell and Auburn, Stephen attended Bowdoin College and later joined the Army after graduation. Following his military service, he returned to Maine to pursue a law degree at the University of Maine School of Law, which he received in 1978. Stephen and his wife, Pam, have been residents of Cumberland since 1983 and are proud parents to two grown daughters and grandparents to two grandchildren.

Throughout his career, Stephen has demonstrated a strong commitment to his community and the state of Maine. His extensive experience in local government and his legal background have equipped him to handle a wide range of legislative matters, particularly those related to the judiciary system, civil rights, and property law.
