Rep. Cassie Julia is serving her first term in the Maine House of Representatives. She serves on the Housing and Economic Development Committee. 

Julia is a founder of Friends of Waterville Public Schools, which is focused on safeguarding the school budget during contentious budget seasons and raising awareness about the importance of fully funding public schools. For years, Julia raised thousands of dollars to pre-pay lunch fees for all reduced-lunch qualifying K-12 students before the state implemented a free lunch program for all. Additionally, she has actively supported school food pantries and enrichment programs, and received a Board of Education recognition award for her advocacy work.    

Julia is a current member of the Waterville Planning Board. She previously served on Waterville’s Historic Preservation Committee and Waterville Public School’s MELMAC Committee. She has lived in Waterville for 20 years and has two children.
