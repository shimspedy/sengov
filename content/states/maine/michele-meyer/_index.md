Michele Meyer is a member of the Democratic Party serving her third term in the Maine House of Representatives, representing District 150. She is the House chair of the Health and Human Services Committee. Meyer has been a resident of Eliot for over 25 years and is a registered nurse with a focus on occupational and community health.

Her legislative work is driven by policies that strengthen social safety net programs, build family resiliency, and promote healthy child development. She is dedicated to ensuring quality health care for Mainers across the lifespan, safeguarding reproductive choice, reducing property tax burdens through increased municipal revenue sharing, fully funding schools, and building the workforce.

Meyer, along with her husband Jay, owns and operates a small organic farm in Eliot. They grow vegetables and flowers, raise and milk a small herd of Nubian dairy goats, and are licensed maple syrup producers. Her commitment to health and community service is reflected in her legislative priorities and personal endeavors.
