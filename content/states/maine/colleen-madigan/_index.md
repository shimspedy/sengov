Colleen Madigan, born on January 22, 1964, is an American politician and social worker from Maine. She is a member of the Democratic Party and currently represents District 64 in the Maine House of Representatives.

Madigan began her political career as Colleen Lachowicz, when she was elected to the Maine Senate from the 25th district. Her tenure in the Senate attracted international attention when the Republican Party of Maine criticized her for playing the online video game World of Warcraft. She was defeated for re-election two years later by Republican Scott Cyrway.

In 2014, she returned to her maiden name, Colleen Madigan, and was elected to the Maine House of Representatives’s District 110 in 2016, winning with 2305 votes to 1661 for Republican Mark Andre. She assumed office for District 64 on December 7, 2022. Her current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Apart from her political career, Madigan has a rich background in social work. After graduating from William Paterson College with a bachelor’s degree in sociology in 1987, she worked with adults with mental illness and spent a year in Eastern Europe providing supportive counseling services to international students. She earned a Master of Social Work from Boston College in 1999. She has spent 25 years as a social worker and lives in Waterville.

Madigan has also been affiliated with the Eagle Scout Review Board. Throughout her political career, she has served on various committees, including the Health and Human Services Committee.
