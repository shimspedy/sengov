Sen. Mattie Daughtry is serving her second term in the Maine Senate. She is a former member of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs and has served as House chair of the Maine Commission on College Affordability and College Completion.

Sen. Daughtry, a lifelong Brunswick resident, graduated from Brunswick High School and Smith College.

Sen. Daughtry co-owns and brews at Moderation Brewing Company, in Brunswick. She also runs her own local photography and video company.

She previously was the communications associate for Maine’s Majority and did legislative research for the organization. She has also worked as a curator for Brunswick-based VSA Arts of Maine, an organization serving people with disabilities through the arts. Sen. Daughtry founded and ran the news department at WOZQ 91.9 FM and also worked in the news department at WFCR 88.5 FM, an NPR station in western Massachusetts. She worked in Congressman Tom Allen’s office as an intern in college. She has extensive experience working in her local community, on a local farm, as a waitress, as a counselor at several local camps and as a contributor to the Times Record.

During her time in the Maine House, Sen. Daughtry championed policies that made a difference to her hometown, region, and the entire state. On the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, she authored and passed nationally recognized bills to reduce student debt and keep young Mainers here, helping to reduce the “brain-drain” that has plagued us for too long. Working with local farmers, she has crafted common-sense legislation to protect and improve Maine’s flourishing local food systems. She has passed legislation to keep carcinogenic chemicals out of our food, water, and bodies. Whether it’s meaningful tax reform, education funding, supporting our seniors, or economic development, she has worked to find solutions that benefit our community.
