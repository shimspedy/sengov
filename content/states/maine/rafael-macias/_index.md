Rep. Rafael Macias is serving his first term in the Maine House of Representatives and serves on the Labor Committee. A native of San Diego, California, Rep. Macias moved to Topsham with his family in 2007 to work at Bath Iron Works as the pre-commissioning supply officer for a new-construction guided missile destroyer.

With 22 years of military service, including deployments to Afghanistan and Japan, Macias brings extensive experience to his legislative role. His military background informs his commitment to creating fair wages and labor standards that support all Mainers.

He lives in Topsham with his wife and has four adult children and two grandchildren.
