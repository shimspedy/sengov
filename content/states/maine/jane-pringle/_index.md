Jane Pringle is a distinguished member of the Democratic Party and currently holds a position in the Maine House of Representatives, where she represents District 107. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term is set to end on December 4, 2024. Jane Pringleâ€™s journey to the Maine House of Representatives began with her successful campaign for election, culminating in a victory in the general election held on November 8, 2022, where she defeated Michael Hall.

In her tenure from 2023 to 2024, Pringle was assigned to the Leaves of Absence Committee and the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee. However, this is not her first stint in the Maine House of Representatives. She had previously served from 2012 to 2014.

On a personal note, Jane Pringle has deep connections to Maine. Although she grew up in New York and Ohio, her family roots in Maine trace back to the 1600s. She spent her summers in Maine throughout her life before finally moving there with her family in 1975. Please note that this information is current as of the last update in September 2023.
