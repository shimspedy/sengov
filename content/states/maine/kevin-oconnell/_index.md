Kevin J. M. O'Connell is an American politician who assumed office as a member of the Maine House of Representatives in 2020, representing the 20th district. A dedicated member of the Democratic Party, O'Connell has a diverse background that includes over thirty years as an Emera Maine lineworker and a twenty-four-year tenure in the Maine Air National Guard, which included service in Iraq. He is affiliated with IBEW Local #1837.

O'Connell's political career includes serving as the mayor of Brewer, Maine, in 2013 and 2017. He has also contributed to Brewer's governance through positions on the city council and school board at different points in time.

In 2020, O'Connell participated in a special election for the 128th district in the Maine House of Representatives, securing victory against Republican Garrel Craig. O'Connell later triumphed in a rematch during the regularly-scheduled 2020 election. In 2022, he successfully ran in the redrawn 20th district, narrowly securing another term against Republican Jennifer Morin.

Within the legislature, O'Connell has been a vocal advocate for reforming the practice of child marriage in Maine. Despite an initial setback in 2021, he persisted and reintroduced legislation in 2023, ultimately succeeding in raising the marriage age to 17. O'Connell expresses his desire to eventually see the age raised to 18.

On a personal note, Kevin J. M. O'Connell is a lifelong resident of Brewer, Maine, reflecting a deep connection to his community.
