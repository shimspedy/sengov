Troy Dale Jackson, born on June 26, 1968, is an American logger and politician hailing from Allagash, Maine. Currently serving as the President of the Maine Senate, he represents Maine Senate District 1, encompassing northern Aroostook County, including the towns of Fort Kent, Madawaska, and Caribou. Jackson assumed the role of Senate President in 2018 and holds the distinction of being first in line for the governorship of Maine in the event of a vacancy.

Jackson's political journey began in 1998 during the logging blockade along the Quebec border, where he protested the illegal hiring of Canadian workers over Maine loggers, advocating for better wages and working conditions. Elected to the Maine House of Representatives, he served three terms before transitioning to the Maine Senate in 2008. Over the years, Jackson has taken on various leadership roles, including Senate Majority Leader, Senate Minority Leader, and his current position as Senate President.

In his career, Jackson has demonstrated a commitment to issues such as healthcare and workers' rights, particularly for fellow loggers. Notably, in 2010, he authored a bill aimed at prohibiting the Maine Department of Conservation from employing foreign laborers at state-owned logging sites, a measure that faced a veto from Governor Paul LePage.

Beyond his legislative efforts, Jackson engaged in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, actively supporting Senator Bernie Sanders and later rallying behind Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris after the primaries.

Jackson's political involvement extends to his role as a member of the Democratic National Committee, a position he assumed on January 25, 2015. He has consistently voiced his advocacy for the people, occasionally engaging in spirited exchanges with political opponents, such as Governor LePage.

On a personal note, Troy Dale Jackson attended Allagash Consolidated Community High School and holds an A.A. in business from the University of Maine at Fort Kent. Residing in Allagash, Maine, he remains dedicated to serving his community and advancing the interests of the people he represents.
