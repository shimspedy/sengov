Ryan Michael Fecteau, born on September 18, 1992, is an American politician who serves as the Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives. A Democrat, Fecteau represents Maine House District 11, which includes a portion of Biddeford.

Speaker Ryan Fecteau is serving his second nonconsecutive term as Speaker of the House and his fifth nonconsecutive term in the Maine House of Representatives, representing part of his hometown of Biddeford. In his service to the state, he has also chaired the Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development Committee and served a term as Assistant Majority Leader. During his first term as Speaker of the House, he was the youngest presiding officer in the United States, and he is the first openly gay Speaker in Maine's history.

Fecteau has spent the past two years working on housing issues both with Avesta Housing and the Governor's Office of Policy Innovation and the Future. A dedicated advocate for working families, healthcare access, and economic development, he has been a key figure in efforts to improve the state's housing policies and promote sustainable growth. His leadership is defined by a deep commitment to service, unity, and the people of Maine.

Fecteau has also been a champion for career and technical education (CTE) and sponsored legislation to allow Maineâ€™s 28 CTE schools to make long-overdue investments in equipment and capital projects. He believes a serious investment is necessary to both address our workforce issues and give young people the hard skills they need to find good-paying jobs right here in Maine.

Speaker Fecteau graduated from the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC. He is the son and grandson of French-Canadian immigrants and was raised by a single mother. Fecteau is the first member of his family to graduate from college. He and his husband reside in Biddeford near his childhood home with their two mostly well-behaved dogs.
