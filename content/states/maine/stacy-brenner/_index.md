Sen. Stacy Brenner is an organic farmer and small business owner who co-founded and now operates Broadturn Farm in Scarborough. Sen. Brenner is a graduate of the University of Arizona, where she studied agriculture and plant sciences. She holds two nursing degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. She spent her early working career as a nurse-midwife. She works part time for Maine Farmland Trust as the Senior Advisor for Land Access.

In 2002, Stacy and her husband, John, moved to Maine to become first-generation farmers. In 2006, Stacy and John opened Broadturn Farm, which produces cut flowers and organic vegetables and hosts weddings. The farm is a thriving example of economic development on farmland protected with an agricultural easement funded by the Land for Maine’s Future program.

Stacy and her husband have two daughters: Florence, 17, who is a high school senior and Emma, 27, who is a nurse at Maine Medical Center and an active organizer in the nurse’s union.

Stacy is in her second term in the Maine State Senate. She is the Senate chair of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee as well as the Chair of the PFAS Fund Advisory Committee. She is the Senate appointee to the Maine Climate Council. She spends her legislative time focused on issues related to the climate and the clean energy transition, agriculture, and PFAS contamination.
