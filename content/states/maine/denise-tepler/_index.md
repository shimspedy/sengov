In 1996, Tepler entered public service by being elected to the M.S.A.D #75 School Board, representing the towns of Bowdoin, Bowdoinham, Harpswell, and Topsham for six years. Her dedication to her community continued as she was elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 2014, where she served until 2022. During her tenure, she was the House Chair of the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee for four years. She championed bills to tackle Big Pharma and reduce drug prices, as well as fought to increase access to affordable health care.

Her efforts were recognized by the American Legion, Department of Maine, which named her Legislator of the Year in 2015 and 2016. In 2019, she was designated a Legislative Champion by Planned Parenthood for her work on LD 1261, which increased access to abortion care.

In 2024, Tepler was elected to the Maine State Senate, representing District 24. She assumed office on December 3, 2024, and her current term ends on December 1, 2026. Throughout her career, Tepler has been a strong advocate for her constituents, focusing on issues such as health care, education, and social justice.
