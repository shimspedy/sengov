Rebecca Jauch is a member of the Democratic Party and currently serves in the Maine House of Representatives, representing District 51. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Jauch lives in Topsham, Maine. She served in the California Army National Guard and earned a B.A. in Criminology from the University of Southern Maine in 2003. Her career experience includes working as a graduate assistant with the University of Southern Maine, an operations officer with the U.S. Intelligence Community, and an interrogator/linguist with the California Army National Guard. She also served as the treasurer of Sagadahoc County.

In the 2022 elections, Jauch ran for election to the Maine House of Representatives to represent District 51 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. During her tenure, she has been assigned to the Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry Committee.

Jauch has spent most of her professional career working in public service. She has a wide range of experience, including as a victim/witness advocate for Sagadahoc County, a firearms and explosives industry operations inspector for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a U.S. Army interrogator/linguist, an operations officer with the Central Intelligence Agency and, most recently, as the Sagadahoc County Treasurer.

She is deeply involved in her community, volunteering at her children’s school and her town’s library, as well as serving on her town’s Board of Appeals. Some of her legislative priorities include addressing the need for more affordable childcare, universal Pre-K, and building resiliency to the impacts of climate change. Jauch is currently working towards her master’s degree in statistics at the University of Southern Maine. She lives in Topsham with her husband, Matt, and their son, daughter, and cat named Matilda.
