Senator Eric Brakey returns to the Maine Senate to represent the people of District 20. The reapportioned district includes the Androscoggin communities of Auburn, New Gloucester, Poland and Durham.

During a time of divided government (2014-2018), Sen. Brakey led the Health and Human Services Committee as its Senate Chairman. Working across the aisle with committee colleagues, he negotiated and passed welfare reforms, Right to Try legislation, and a market-driven overhaul of Maine’s medical cannabis laws. Sen. Brakey also authored Maine’s Constitutional Carry law and worked with sixth-grade students to legalize hedgehog ownership.

The Constitutional Carry measure earned him the 2015 Second Amendment Award from the Sportsmen’s Alliance of Maine.

Outside the Maine Senate, Sen. Brakey lives in Auburn with his wife, Kaitlin. Before launching his 2022 campaign for the Maine Senate, he worked as a national spokesperson, policy adviser and growth strategist for Young Americans for Liberty, a pro-liberty youth organization advancing liberty on campus and in American electoral politics.

Sen. Brakey has published op-eds in notable national outlets including The Hill, The Federalist and the Washington Examiner.
