Sen. Tim Nangle has called Maine home for more than three decades. Growing up, he watched his dad run multiple businesses, instilling in him a strong work ethic. The youngest of ten children, he learned the value of hard work at a young age. Sen. Nangle worked as a 911 dispatcher, firefighter and police officer in his hometown of Boxford, MA.

After becoming a paramedic in 1988, Sen. Nangle moved to Maine in 1990. He continued to follow his calling to help others while working at the Portland Fire Department as a Medcu Paramedic, where he worked for 27 years before retiring.  He ran for Town Council in Windham to continue serving the community. As a member of the Town Council, he supported initiatives to create and enhance public parks, preserve open space, protect water quality of the water bodies in Windham, and provide property tax relief for seniors and disabled veterans. He also supported investing in the town’s infrastructure by supporting the construction of a new public works facility and developing plans for a municipal waste water system in North Windham as well as renovations to Windham’s library and the Windham Police and Fire stations.

Sen. Nangle is serving his first term in the Maine Senate, representing Casco, Frye Island, Raymond, Windham, and part of Westbrook. He lives in Windham.
