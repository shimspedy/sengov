Archer recently served as the Deputy Mayor and Ward 1 Councilor for the City of Saco. An active member of the community, he serves as a board member or advisor to several local organizations, including VET 2 Vet Maine, AMVETS and the Biddeford Saco Chamber of Commerce. He also recently served on the board of the Southern Maine Finance Authority. 

From 2001 to 2005, Archer served in the U.S. Marines, deploying to Iraq twice and providing security support in the Anbar Province. He holds a bachelor’s degree in social work from the University of Southern Maine and a master's degree in social work from the University of New England.
