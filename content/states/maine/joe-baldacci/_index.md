Joe has been practicing law for 28 years. A lifelong resident of Bangor, he has represented Maine families and small businesses in his small private practice in downtown Bangor.

Joe served for 12 years on the Bangor City Council — including twice as Mayor and Council Chair — and has promoted and supported several important economic redevelopment projects throughout the city. Joe successfully worked to keep the Bangor City Nursing Home open when it was threatened with closure. He helped the Fire Department establish its ambulance and paramedic unit, which now brings in millions in revenue to the City and provides people with life-saving services. In 2004, Joe was appointed by the Council to negotiate an agreement with the City of Halifax concerning their airport. The successful agreement reached protects Bangor International Airport’s preclearance business on international flights.

Growing up in Bangor, Joe worked alongside his seven brothers and sisters at their family-owned restaurant, Momma Baldacci’s—a restaurant that came to be known as a community place to gather. He graduated with distinction from the University of Maine with a B.A. in political science in 1987 and earned his law degree with Juris Doctorate from the University of Maine School of Law in Portland, in 1991. During law school, Joe co-founded the Maine Association for Public Interest Law (MAPIL), which still provides scholarships to law students who work in the public interest legal field. After law school, Joe returned to Bangor to start his law practice.
