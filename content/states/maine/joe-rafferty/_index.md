Senator Joe Rafferty, better known to his neighbors as Coach Raff, graduated from Springfield College with a degree in Physical Education, making him the first person in his family to graduate from college. He went on to an extended career in education that continues to this day. Since 1978, Joe’s goal has been to provide his students and players the support they need to become the leaders he knows they can be — no matter the path they choose in life.

Throughout his career, Joe worked diligently for fellow educators in local and state associations. From 1984 until his retirement in 2018, he was a strong advocate and voice for teachers, serving in various capacities: as President of the Teacher’s Union, Building Representative on the Executive Committee, and Chief Negotiator on the contract negotiation team. He approached negotiations with an eye toward two goals many Mainers seek — to earn a living wage and have access to affordable health care.

Though retired, Joe continues to be an active member of the community. This fall was his 42nd season as the Head Football Coach of the Kennebunk Rams. When not coaching, he continues to work in the school district as a substitute teacher and bus driver.

Joe and his wife and fellow educator, Norma, live in Kennebunk. Together they raised three daughters, each a graduate of Kennebunk High School.
