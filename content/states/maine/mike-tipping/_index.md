Sen. Mike Tipping grew up in Orono, attending Asa Adams Elementary and Orono Middle and High School before studying Political Science at Dalhousie University, where he served as Student Union President and Chair of the Alliance of Nova Scotia Student Associations.

Sen. Tipping has worked in the field of public advocacy for his entire career, including serving as spokesperson for statewide referendum campaigns to expand senior care and raise Maine’s minimum wage.

Working for the Maine People’s Alliance and Maine People’s Resource Center, he helped hold the former owners of the HoltraChem plant accountable for mercury pollution in the Penobscot River through a landmark federal lawsuit and mandated ecosystem-wide cleanup.

Sen. Tipping has written regular opinion columns for several Maine publications and in 2014 authored the book “As Maine Went” on Maine politics and policy.

A proud union member, Sen. Tipping believes that by working together we can build stronger communities and better lives for families in Maine.

He lives in Orono with his wife, Maggie, and their eight-year-old twins.

Sen. Tipping is serving his first term in the Maine Senate.
