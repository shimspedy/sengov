Cheryl Golek is a member of the Democratic Party and represents District 99 in the Maine House of Representatives. She is serving her first term in the Maine House of Representatives. She is a member of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee and the newly-formed Joint Select Committee on Housing.

A lifelong resident of Maine, Rep. Golek was born and raised in the district she now represents. She and her life partner of 27 years, Johanna Wigg, have four children, including two adult sons and two young daughters. In 1998, Rep. Golek and Johanna founded The Vicarage By The Sea, an alternative model of care for those living with Dementia.

Rep. Golek was born into generational poverty and endured years as a homeless teen. She lived in poverty for more than half of her life before finding her way to success. These life experiences have given her a personal understanding of the economic realities that many Mainers face and has fueled her desire to find real solutions to poverty and the economic challenges facing many in our state.

Rep. Golek has completed the Maine AFL-CIO candidate training and is a proud 2019 graduate of Emerge Maine. She is also a member of the Equal Justice Partners Circle and was appointed in 2021 by former Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau to the Commission to Increase Housing Opportunities in Maine by Studying Zoning and Land Use Restrictions.

Rep. Golek strongly believes that people with firsthand, lived experience must have a voice in the legislative process, and she is committed to making those voices heard. She assumed office on December 7, 2022. Her current term ends on December 4, 2024. Golek ran for election to the Maine House of Representatives to represent District 99. She won in the general election on November 8, 2022.
