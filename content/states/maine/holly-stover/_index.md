Holly Stover, affiliated with the Democratic Party, serves as a representative in the Maine House of Representatives, representing District 48. Commencing her tenure on December 7, 2022, she is currently in office, with her term set to conclude on December 4, 2024.

Holly Stover, a proud native of Boothbay, emerged from a nurturing environment steeped in community values, with parents dedicated to service. Her mother's role as an educator at Boothbay Region Elementary School and her father's position as a maintenance foreman at Boothbay Railway Village set the stage for a life committed to community well-being.

Currently seeking re-election for Maine House District 48, Holly's journey is marked by a 23-year tenure with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. Transitioning to her current role as the Executive Director of Lincoln County Dental, a grassroots non-profit, she channels her passion into providing vital oral health services to those in need. Simultaneously, as the Program Director of the Addiction Outreach partnership between the Boothbay Region Community Resource Council and the Boothbay Harbor Police Department, Holly spearheads efforts to address substance use disorders, making a significant impact on over 250 individuals in just four years.

Holly's legislative experience has revealed the challenges faced by rural communities when left unsupported. Her insights underscore the necessity of a well-informed state government actively collaborating with local communities to tackle complex issues. Recognizing the gravity of the opioid epidemic, Holly advocates for comprehensive, community-oriented solutions.

In her commitment to House District 48, Holly emphasizes the need for accessible healthcare, quality education, affordable permanent housing, secure non-medical transportation, gainful employment, and prioritizing the right to age in place. She envisions a collaborative approach between state government and communities, especially in rural areas, to empower individuals with the tools and opportunities essential for thriving. Holly Stover's biography is a testament to her dedication to fostering holistic community well-being and championing the rights and necessities of all residents.
