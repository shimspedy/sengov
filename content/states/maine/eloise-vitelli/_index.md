Sen. Vitelli has made Arrowsic her home for the last 40 years. She represents Senate District 24 in the Maine Senate, which includes all of Sagadahoc County and the town of Dresden in Lincoln County. She was first elected to the Maine Senate during a special election in 2013.

Sen. Vitelli has been an active member of her community, having served on the zoning board of appeals in her hometown of Arrowsic, the local school committee and the Regional School Unit 1 School Board. She also has served on the Mid Coast Economic Development District, and currently serves on the board of Kennebec Estuary Land Trust.

She began her professional life as an early childhood teacher and spent a year as an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer working with the Maine Women’s Lobby. Recently retired after 38 years, she worked with New Ventures Maine, a statewide organization that helps Maine people create their own path to a career by finding jobs, continuing with education or starting a small business. The Maine Small Business Administration has recognized Sen. Vitelli’s career in economic development, which also included serving for many years on the Maine Economic Growth Council. In 1995 she was inducted into the Maine Women’s Hall of Fame.

Sen. Vitelli is the mother of two grown sons, and lives with her husband, Bob, in the home she built in Arrowsic after attending the Shelter Institute. Surrounded by gardens and her chickens, she believes that it’s important to work hard for what you have, and that together, Mainers can do great things.
