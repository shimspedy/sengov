Representative Scott Cyrway, a resident of Albion, is currently navigating his inaugural term representing House District 63. This district encompasses the towns of Albion, Freedom, the Unity Township, and parts of Winslow. Serving on the 131st Legislature’s Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services, Scott brings a wealth of experience, having previously held four terms in the Maine Senate. During his Senate tenure, he contributed to the Joint Standing Committees on Justice and Public Safety, as well as the Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement, and Business.

Mr. Cyrway's commitment to service extends beyond the legislative arena. He spent two years as a Major in the United States Air Force Civil Air Patrol. His academic journey includes a Minor in Forest Management from the University of Maine in 1974, an Associate’s Degree in Life Science and Agriculture in 1976, and graduation from the Law Enforcement Full-Time Academy in 1992.

Scott's diverse career path reflects his versatility. From being a crop and dairy farmer (1964-1976) to a professional artificial cattle breeding inseminator (1976-1984), a real estate associate broker (1984-1986), and an insurance agent (1984-1986), he has navigated varied professional landscapes. Currently, Mr. Cyrway serves in the Kennebec County Sheriff’s Office as the Assistant Jail Administrator and Deputy Sheriff Patrolman, holding the role of D.A.R.E. Training Coordinator for the State of Maine.

Throughout his political and law enforcement career, Rep. Cyrway has received numerous accolades, including Life Saving and Valor Awards from the Kennebec County Sheriff’s Office (2010), the American Legion Legislator of the Year Award (2016), the Lifetime Daryl F. Gates Award from the International D.A.R.E. Association (2016), and the Christian Civics League Minuteman Award (2018).

In his personal life, Scott and his wife, Jill, are proud parents to three children and twelve grandchildren. During his leisure moments, Rep. Cyrway finds solace in outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, sledding, and exploring in his Jeep. He also enjoys expressing his musical talents by playing the guitar and singing.
