Rep. Yusuf Yusuf is serving his first term in the Maine House of Representatives. He is a member of the Housing and Economic Development Committee.

Having received his bachelor's degree in sociology with a minor in psychology from Western Washington University, Yusuf felt drawn to Portland, Maine, after hearing about the advocacy work being done by community members with a similar background to his own. For the past seven years Yusuf has worked as a mental health case manager, a career which inspired him and his wife, Halimo, to establish an essential home care service business for older adults and individuals with disabilities.

When not operating his business, Yusuf works closely with Gateway Community Services and previously served as a member on the Portland Board of Public Education. His leadership roles in these organizations have allowed him to serve the community, while also gaining valuable experience in strategic planning, public policy and budget management.
