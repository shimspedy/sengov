Lori Gramlich is a dedicated member of the Maine House of Representatives, representing District 131, which includes Old Orchard Beach. She is currently serving her third term and holds the position of House chair of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee. Her legislative priorities are focused on ensuring affordable and accessible behavioral health care, protecting children from abuse, and safeguarding the environment from toxic chemicals.

With a master’s degree in social work from the University of New England, Lori has over 35 years of experience in nonprofit prevention-based social work, advocacy, and social justice initiatives. Her career has spanned roles at the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, as communications director for Maine Senate President Beverly Daggett, and as an adjunct faculty member at the University of Southern Maine School of Social Work.

Lori’s commitment to public service is also evident from her time on the Portland School Committee, where she chaired the Legislative Affairs and Policy Committees and served on the Finance Committee. She has been an executive director of the National Association of Social Workers, Maine Chapter, and is deeply invested in her community.

A Maine resident for more than 35 years, Lori is a proud mother and enjoys writing, gardening, and spending time at the beach when not engaged in her advocacy work. Her passion for social work and dedication to her constituents make her a respected and influential figure in Maine’s political landscape.
