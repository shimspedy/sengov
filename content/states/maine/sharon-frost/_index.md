Rep. Sharon Frost is serving her first term in the Maine House.

A former educator, Frost has devoted herself to volunteering in schools. She is dedicated to investing in public education to retain graduates who will go on to strengthen Maine’s economy.

Frost is also passionate about protecting Maine’s environment and natural resources. She formerly worked as an agro-forestry volunteer in the Peace Corps and now supports local lakes associations and conservation groups.

She is also concerned about the mental health struggles affecting many Mainers today, and fully supports social workers, counselors and mental health advocates.

Frost loves to travel and enjoys exploring new cultures. She also loves to garden, read and hike with her dogs in Maine’s beautiful mountains. She cherishes any opportunity to gather with her husband, three daughters and friends for a meal with lots of laughter!
