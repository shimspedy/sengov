Rep. Ellie Sato (Sah-Toh) is currently serving her first term in the Maine House of Representatives, representing part of her hometown of Gorham. She serves on the Judiciary Committee. 

Sato is proud to be a first-generation Mainer and first-generation American. She graduated summa cum laude from Fordham University Lincoln Center and from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater with a B.F.A. in dance as well as a minor in political science.

Her previous work experience includes time as a professional dancer, bartender, after-school dance teacher, personal assistant and legislative aide in the Maine Senate Majority Office during the 131st Legislature. Her eclectic background working primarily in minimum-wage jobs served as a catalyst for her transition to public service.
