As a small business owner and community volunteer, Jessica Fay has been an active participant in her community for over two decades. Her passion for protecting Maine’s environment was nurtured from a young age, spending time at her family’s camp on Sebago Lake in Raymond. This passion has translated into her political career, where she serves as the House chair of the Government Oversight Committee and is a member of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee.

In addition to her political career, Jessica Fay is also known for her commitment to public service. Inspired by her family members who worked in the public sector and served on volunteer and elected boards and committees, she volunteers at the local library and founded an Age-Friendly Community initiative in her hometown of Raymond.

Before her political career, Jessica Fay was a successful entrepreneur. She opened her first business, Raymond Village Florist, in 2000. Her experience as a small business owner has given her valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by small businesses in Maine.

Jessica Fay ran for re-election to the Maine House of Representatives to represent District 86 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. She continues to serve her community and state with dedication and commitment.
