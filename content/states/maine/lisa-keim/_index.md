Senator Lisa Keim, a lifelong resident of western Maine, is serving her fourth term in the Maine State Senate and currently represents District 19. Largely comprising of her former District 18, the newly reapportioned district includes municipalities and unorganized territories in both Franklin and Oxford counties.

She serves as the Assistant Republican Leader for the Caucus and most recently served as the Senate Republican Lead on the Government Oversight Committee. She also previously served as chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary and as a member of the State and Local Government Committee. She has also served as chair of the Working Group to Improve the Provision of Indigent Legal Services, the Right to Know Advisory Commission, and the Criminal Records Review Advisory Committee.

Outside of state government, Sen. Keim is a member of the New England Board of Higher Educationâ€™s (NEBHE) Legislative Advisory Committee, is a state director for Women in Government, and serves on the Council of State Governments (CSG) East Executive Committee.

A Harvard Kennedy School Senior Executive SLG Fellow, she holds a Bachelor of Science in Leadership and Marketing from the University of Southern Maine, is a graduate of the 2017 Eastern Leadership Academy, and is also a Henry Toll Fellow.

A wife of more than 30 years to her husband, Blue, Sen. Keim is the proud mother of three adult children whom she homeschooled into high school. While her happiest moments are climbing a mountain with her family, she enjoys all time spent on outdoor activities including skiing, bike and ATV riding, yard work and, yes, even shoveling snow.
