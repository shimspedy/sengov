W. Edward Crockett is a member of the Democratic Party serving his third term in the Maine House of Representatives, representing District 112. He is a native of Portland, Maine, born and raised on Munjoy Hill. Crockett has a rich educational background with bachelor’s degrees in journalism and broadcasting from the University of Maine at Orono and a Master of Business Administration from Boston College.

In his professional life, Crockett is the president of Capt’n Eli’s Soda, a premium Maine soft drink company. He has also held leadership positions with iconic Maine food and beverage brands such as Country Kitchen, Hannaford, and Oakhurst Dairy. His career also includes experience as a newscaster at a Bangor-based television station.

Crockett is an author as well, having penned the memoir “The Ghosts of Walter Crockett.” His commitment to community service is evident through his past roles as a board member of Big Brothers Big Sisters, a corporator for Boys and Girls Clubs, and two decades spent as a volunteer youth coach.

Crockett’s family has deep roots in Portland, with his wife, Martha, and their three children, Seth, Mattie, and Ted, all having graduated from Portland High School, just as he did. In the Maine House of Representatives, he currently sits on the Taxation Committee and the Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement, and Business Committee. These committees handle matters related to business regulation, economic development, technology commercialization, tourism, state and local taxes, tax exemptions and credits, and more.
