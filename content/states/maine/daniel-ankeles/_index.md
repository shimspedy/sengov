Dan Ankeles, a member of the Democratic Party, represents District 100 in the Maine House of Representatives. He assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term is set to end on December 4, 2024. Ankeles ran for election to the Maine House of Representatives to represent District 100 and won in the general election held on November 8, 2022.

Born in Peabody, Massachusetts, Ankeles earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Chicago in 2004. Prior to becoming a lawmaker, Ankeles worked as a legislative aide in the House Democratic Office for nine years. He has also worked as a public radio producer, organized campaigns for his fellow Democrats, and defended Maine’s same-day voter registration law in a 2011 referendum campaign.

Ankeles is an at-large member of the Brunswick Town Council, where he has advocated successfully for conservation, public education, and the creation of Brunswick’s new Housing Committee. His top local priorities include replacing the aging stormwater system on the former naval air base and removing harmful PFAS chemicals, reducing local dependence on regressive property taxation, supporting Brunswick’s working waterfront and the health of its rivers and coastline, making it easier to lower speed limits, and expanding bicycle and pedestrian trails between Brunswick and neighboring communities.

Ankeles enjoys learning languages, exercising, playing games, and spending time with his family. He and his wife Catherine have lived in Brunswick since 2011 and are raising their two children in Brunswick schools. Ankeles is serving his first term in the Maine House of Representatives and is a member of the Transportation Committee.
