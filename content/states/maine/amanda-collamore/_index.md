Representative Amanda Collamore of Pittsfield is in her second term representing House District 68, encompassing the towns of Burnham, Clinton, Pittsfield, and Troy. Currently serving on the 131st Legislature’s Joint Standing Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement, and Business, she continues her commitment to this role from the previous session.

Amanda earned her degree in Early Childhood Education at Kennebec Valley Community College and is presently working towards securing her teaching certification for Secondary Education in Mathematics. Concurrently, she serves as the Education and Outreach Manager at the University of Maine's Transportation Infrastructure Durability Center (TIDC).

Beyond her legislative and educational pursuits, Rep. Collamore is a dedicated small business owner, managing both a photography business and a property management venture. Her enthusiasm for community service is evident in her active involvement with various non-profit organizations, including homeless shelters, food banks, community events like the Central Maine Egg Festival, and the Relay for Life—an organization close to her heart. Amanda consistently donates her time and resources to make a positive impact on the lives of those around her.
