Representative Joseph Galletta of Durham is currently in his first term in the Maine House, representing District 98, which includes the towns of Durham and Pownal, along with portions of Lisbon, Bowdoin, and Topsham. Within the 131st Legislature, he actively serves on the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing.

Rep. Galletta is deeply concerned about the divisive political climate, advocating for tax reduction and a reversal of policies impacting the rising costs of gas and other commodities in Maine.

As a small business owner with a substantial career in the automotive industry, Rep. Galletta brings valuable expertise to his role. He, along with his wife Jennifer, resides in Durham and is proud parents to three children: Kara, Lindsey, and Ryanne.

Joe pursued his education at Keene State College from 1985-1990.
