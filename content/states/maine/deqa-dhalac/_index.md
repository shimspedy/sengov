Deqa Dhalac is a notable figure in American politics, particularly in the state of Maine. Born in Mogadishu, Somalia, around 1968 or 1969, Dhalac’s journey to the United States is a testament to her resilience and determination. Her early life in Somalia was marked by the influence of her politically outspoken father, a petroleum engineer who was a staunch advocate for girls’ education and women’s roles in society.

In the face of the Somali Civil War, Dhalac fled her homeland in 1990, initially landing in Rome with the intention of heading to Libya. However, due to the escalating conflict, she sought asylum and eventually moved to England, then Toronto in 1991. By 1992, Dhalac had married Abdi Farah, a Somali businessman from Atlanta, and began her new life in the United States.

Dhalac’s career in America started modestly as she worked as a cashier in a parking garage. With her accounting degree, she soon secured a position in accounts receivable at a hotel. Her proficiency in English, which she learned as a child, facilitated her career advancement. In 2005, Dhalac relocated to Lewiston, Maine, with her family, where she became an interpreter for Catholic Charities Maine and later opened her own interpreting service. Her commitment to education continued as she earned two master’s degrees in policy and social work from the University of New Hampshire and the University of New England.

Dhalac’s political career began to take shape when she made national headlines as the first Somali-American mayor in the United States, elected unanimously in South Portland, Maine. Her tenure as mayor lasted from 2021 to 2022, during which she became a symbol of hope and progress for many. In 2022, following the withdrawal of State Representative Victoria Morales from the race for Maine’s 120th State House District, Dhalac was nominated to take her place on the ballot. She won the election to the Maine House of Representatives on November 8, 2022, alongside Mana Abdi, becoming one of the first Somali-Americans to serve as a Maine legislator.

Throughout her life, Deqa Dhalac has been a force for positive change, advocating for an end to racism, better housing and jobs, improved schools, a cleaner environment, and a community where everyone feels welcomed and included. Her leadership style, rooted in her native Somali culture and her rich life experiences, teaches us to lead from the collective wisdom of the community. Dhalac continues to be a dynamic community leader, using her voice to advocate for the changes her community wishes to see.
