Dill's political journey commenced in 2010 when he was first elected to the Maine Legislature, representing House District 14 for two terms. Subsequently, in 2014, he transitioned to Senate District 5, completing an impressive fourth term in the Maine Senate in 2022.

Beyond his political commitments, Dill is an esteemed professional in the field of entomology. He holds both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in entomology from the University of Maine, along with a Ph.D. in entomology from Purdue University (1979). Since 1981, Dill has served as a pest management specialist for the University of Maine Cooperative Extension. In this capacity, he coordinates crucial programs such as the Extension Diagnostic and Research Laboratory, Integrated Pest Management, and Pesticide Safety Education.

In 2021, his outstanding contributions were acknowledged with the University of Maine Presidential Public Engagement Award.

Dill's legislative service includes representation of Maine Senate District 5, located in Penobscot County.
