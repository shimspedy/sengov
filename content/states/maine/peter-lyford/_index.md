Senator Peter Lyford is serving his first term in the Maine Senate. He represents the people of the newly reapportioned District 10, which includes municipalities in both Penobscot and northern Hancock counties.

Prior to his election to the Senate, he began his legislative service when he was elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 2014 and served four terms representing District 129. He served as a member of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee.

Sen. Lyford brings practical business experience to Augusta. A graduate of Husson University (then-Husson College), he is the president and CEO of Peter A. Lyford, Inc., a hydroseeding and commercial landscaping company, with locations in Gorham and Hermon. He also owns a TruGreen franchise.

He served as the chair of the Land Management Committee for Katahdin Charities Inc., the local affiliate of the Boy Scouts of America. He is also a member of the Supervisory Committee for the Brewer Federal Credit Union, and a former member of the Governor’s Maine State Wind Commission.

Sen. Lyford is a deacon with the Clifton United Baptist Church and a former selectman for the Town of Eddington, where he also served on the town’s economic development board. He is also a member of the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine.

He lives with his wife, Marcia, in Eddington. They have two adult children and three grandchildren. In his spare time, you’ll likely find him hunting, fishing, trapping, beekeeping and enjoying the great Maine outdoors.
