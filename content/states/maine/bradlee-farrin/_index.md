Senator Brad Farrin is currently serving his third term in the Maine State Senate. He represents the people of District 3, which was reapportioned this year to include municipalities in both Somerset and Penobscot counties as well as the Kennebec County communities of Benton, Clinton and Unity Township.

Prior to serving in the Maine Senate, Sen. Farrin served District 111 for two terms in the Maine House of Representatives. While there, he served as the ranking member of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee and the Transportation Committee. He continued his service on both of those committees as the Senate Republican Lead in the last two terms.

With more than 30 years of experience in construction and project management, Sen. Farrin is the Corporate Facilities Manager for Milton CAT, New Englandâ€™s premier construction equipment supplier, as well as Milton Rents, a construction equipment rental company. In this role, he is responsible for property management, regulatory compliance, facility maintenance and the start-up of all major capital projects for 27 facilities across six states.

Prior to his legislative service, he was the Command Chief Master Sergeant for the Maine Air National Guard before retiring in 2013 as its highest-ranking enlisted airman after serving for nearly three decades. He deployed to Iraq in 2008 in Operation Iraqi Freedom and to the Horn of Africa in 2009 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Sen. Farrin has more than 18 major awards and decorations, including the Legion of Merit and the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal.

He is a proud member of the American Legion, VFW, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard, and the Air Force Sergeants Association. Locally, he served as a captain with the Norridgewock Fire Department until 2004. Sen. Farrin lives in Norridgewock with his wife, Lynn. Between the two, they have four daughters and two grandchildren.
