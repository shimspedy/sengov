Senator Marianne Moore is in her third term representing the constituents of District 6 in the Maine State Senate. The newly reapportioned district includes all municipalities and unorganized territories in Washington County and 16 communities in eastern Hancock County.

She previously served as the Senate Republican Lead on the Health and Human Services Committee, a passion that stems from her extensive community service as a Meals on Wheels volunteer. She is also a member of Eastern Area Agency on Aging’s advisory board for Washington County and is a member of the Calais Lioness Club.

A resident of Calais, Sen. Moore is a former city councilor who served three terms (nine years) on the Council with two of those terms as mayor. She used to own and operate the local Curves Fitness Center. She is a former Washington County Cancer Patient Navigator where she helped address the complex barriers to short- and long-term care faced by cancer patients in Washington County. She still facilitates a Calais-area breast cancer support group.

She is a former member of the Washington County Extension Association, which oversees the programs of the University of Maine’s Cooperative Extension Service in Washington County; and she served as Treasurer of the Washington County Development Authority. She is also a former member of the Maine Permanent Commission on the Status of Women and served as both a trustee and board member of the Calais Community Hospital, formerly known as Calais Regional Hospital.

Sen. Moore is also the former executive board chair of the St. Croix Valley Chamber of Commerce and taught at Washington County Community College in Calais.

As the daughter of an Air Force non-commissioned officer, she’s been fortunate to live in many areas throughout the United States and chose to retire in Maine. She is the mother of two daughters, three grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and a longhaired Calico named Gizmo.
