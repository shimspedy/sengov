Rep. Kilton Webb is serving his first term in the Maine House of Representatives. 

After graduation, Webb completed an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. Since joining his local union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 567, Webb has been a strong advocate for working-class Mainers across the state.

Webb was the apprentice representative for his local union’s executive board for two years before graduating from the program. He currently serves as the Western Maine Labor Council’s Vice President. Webb also founded his local union’s Young Worker Committee to better understand and meet the needs of young workers like himself. He currently works as an organizer and membership development director for IBEW Local 567.

Webb is interested in making Maine a better place for young people to grow and thrive.  He believes the best way to do that is by investing not only in the physical infrastructure we use every day, but also the educational infrastructure we need to give Mainers the tools to succeed.  

Webb is a lifelong Mainer who grew up in Wayne with his parents, Monica and David, and sister, Ireland. He attended Maranacook High School and currently lives in Durham.
