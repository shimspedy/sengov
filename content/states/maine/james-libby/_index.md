Senator James D. Libby is returning to the Maine State Senate representing the people of District 22. Newly formed due to reapportionment, the district is comprised of 13 communities in Oxford, Cumberland and York counties.

Known to his students as Dr. Libby, he has been a faculty member at Thomas College since 2002 and joined Colby College as a visiting professor in 2017. He is currently a member of the policy committee for the Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce. He has written four books, including “Super U: The History and Politics of the University of Maine System” and a 2009 publication entitled “Buxton, A Postcard History.”

This isn’t the first time Sen. Libby has served in the Maine Legislature. He began his service in 1992, serving two terms in the Maine House of Representatives before joining the Senate in 1996. He served two terms in the Senate and later ran in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2002.

During his previous service in the Legislature, he was a member of the Labor Committee; Education and Cultural Affairs Committee; State and Local Government Committee; and Natural Resources Committee.

Sen. Libby has served on the board of directors for the Maine Community College System, the Waterville Opera House, and the Jobs for Maine’s Graduates Program. He was a member of the Southern Maine Area Agency on Aging Advisory Committee and served as a political consultant for WGAN Radio in Portland.

His professional achievements at Thomas College include three years as academic dean from 2012 through 2015. He also chaired the Ryan School of Business Administration from 2007 to 2012, served as internship director, international studies director, head men’s basketball coach, head women’s basketball coach, and head golf coach during his 20-year tenure at Thomas College.

Previous employers include Sanford High School; Gorham High School; St. Joseph’s College; Corning, Inc.; and GTE-Sylvania.

Sen. Libby holds a Ph.D. in public policy and Certificate of Advanced Study in education from the University of Maine. He earned his MBA at St. Bonaventure University and a Bachelor of Science in finance and management from Nasson College.

Sen. Libby currently lives in Standish with his wife of 22 years, Jennifer, and their two teenage children, Grace and Brett. Jennifer teaches special education for MSAD #6. They enjoy music, school sports, skiing, auto racing, and their new cocker spaniel, Stella.
