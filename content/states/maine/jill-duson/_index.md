A child of the Civil Rights movement, Sen. Jill Duson was inspired by the activism of her mother and empowered local parents who protested and demonstrated for over two years to achieve court-ordered desegregation of schools in her hometown.

A steadfast leader in the City of Portland, Sen. Duson served as a member and Chair of the School Committee prior to serving over 19 years as an At-Large City Councilor, including two terms as appointed Mayor. As an elected municipal official, Sen. Duson fought for resources to support schools, while at the same time holding school leaders accountable for creating a quality system where all students can learn and thrive. Sen. Duson focused on ensuring safe, affordable, and accessible housing options in Portland that match the diverse needs of those who live and work in the city.

The Senator is a retired attorney and a Maine State Retiree. Her most recent state service included Director of the Bureau of Rehabilitation Services and Director of Compliance for the Maine Human Rights Commission.

Sen. Duson recognizes that those who came before her fought to open doors; she has dedicated a lifetime to serving our community and holding doors open for todayâ€™s students, families, emerging activists, and leaders. She is committed to paying the fight forward.

Sen. Duson is the first black woman to serve in the Maine Senate. She represents part of Portland and Westbrook.
