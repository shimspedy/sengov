Robert Nutting, born on March 18, 1947, is a Republican politician from Maine, USA. He served six terms in the Maine House of Representatives. Nutting re-joined the House after a two-year absence in 2008 and was elected speaker by the incoming Republican majority following the 2010 election, becoming the first Republican Maine House Speaker since 1974.

Nutting was born in Maine. His father was a roofer and plumber and his mother was a nurse. He has two older siblings, a sister and a brother, who are both retired teachers. He graduated from Skowhegan Area High School in 1965 and attained a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy in 1970. From 1972 to 2003, Nutting owned and operated True’s Pharmacy in Oakland. His pharmacy was forced to close following a billing dispute with the state Department of Human Services in which they were accused of over-billing MaineCare, the state’s version of Medicaid, for up to $2.3 million.

Nutting has received several industry awards and honors and served on the boards of directors of area business groups as well as having formerly been President of the Maine Pharmacy Association. Nutting left the Speakership on December 3, 2012, after the Democrats retook the House majority. As of 2023, he is the last Republican Maine House Speaker.

Nutting married Wendy Libby in 1968. They have three children and five grandchildren. He is currently a member of the Maine House of Representatives, representing District 66. He assumed office on December 7, 2022. His current term ends on December 4, 2024.
