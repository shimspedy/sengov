Daniel Hobbs is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the Maine House of Representatives for District 145. He is currently in his second non-consecutive term and is a member of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee. With a background in the transportation sector, Hobbs has retired from a major U.S. airline and has also worked for companies in ferry and bus services.

His legislative priorities include protecting Maineâ€™s coastline, especially the Wells marsh and working harbor, which are vital to the local economy, and advocating for local school funding. Hobbs is a lifelong Mainer, having graduated from Deering High School in Portland and Nasson College in Springvale. Before his tenure in the state legislature, he served on the Wells Board of Selectmen. His commitment to environmental policy is evident through his committee work, where he addresses issues such as air and water quality, natural resource protection, and waste management.
