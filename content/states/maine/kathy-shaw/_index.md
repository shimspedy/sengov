Kathleen Shaw is a member of the Democratic Party and represents District 88 in the Maine House of Representatives. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024.

Shaw ran for election to the Maine House of Representatives to represent District 88 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. In the general election for Maine House of Representatives District 88, Kathleen Shaw defeated James Sorcek.

In terms of committee assignments for 2023-2024, Shaw was assigned to the Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry Committee.

Beyond her political career, Shaw is a lifelong farmer, landscaper, and small business owner who has been a familiar face and voice at Auburn city council meetings. She believes in small farm encouragement, land and natural resource preservation, and maintaining the way of life in Maine for future generations and those that come to enjoy its abundant clean air and outdoor living experience.

Shaw is the longtime president of the Cumberland Farmers’ Market that operates and oversees two thriving seasonal markets in Falmouth and Cumberland. In addition to her farm and market duties, she serves as a supervisor on the Androscoggin/Sagadahoc Soil and Water Conservation district, is the chair of the Auburn Natural Products and Agriculture working group, and a member of Auburn’s Regulatory Advisory Board.

Despite being more at home outdoors working with her Katahdin sheep, livestock guardian dogs, and all her farm animals, Kathy is committed to working across the aisle and doing her part to build a stronger working partnership between the parties in Augusta.
