Representative Caldwell Jackson, representing Oxford, is presently in his inaugural term in the Maine House, representing District 80, which includes the towns of Buckfield, Hebron, Otisfield, and Oxford. He actively participates in the 131st Legislature’s Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry.

Bringing extensive experience in public service at the local, county, and state levels, Rep. Jackson has held roles such as Deputy Commissioner and Economic Development Specialist for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry. Currently serving as the Chairman of the Oxford Board of Selectmen, he has also been a dedicated Oxford County Commissioner. As a longstanding member of the Oxford County Fair, Caldie presently serves on their Board of Directors and is affiliated with the Lake Thompson Fish and Game Club.

Alongside his wife, Diane, Rep. Jackson is the proud owner and operator of Breezy Hill Farm, established in 1982. Initially focused on livestock and hay production, the farm has evolved to produce potatoes, fresh produce, and free-range eggs for both wholesale and retail markets. They offer their products at Jackson’s Greenspot, an on-site local farm stand.

Caldie and Diane, parents to three grown children and grandparents to eight grandchildren, all residing in Maine, find joy in family life. In his leisure time, Rep. Jackson enjoys the pastime of playing golf.
