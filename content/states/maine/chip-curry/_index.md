Sen. Chip Curry’s career as an educator, academic advisor and youth development advocate has been driven by a calling to help people of all ages reach their highest potential. He lives in Belfast with his wife of 25 years, Christi, their teenage daughter, and Christi’s mom. Christi is a long-time teacher and Waldo County Teacher of the Year honoree. As a family, they care deeply about lifelong learning.

Sen. Curry knows how to fight for Waldo County in Augusta because he’s done it. He served on the Maine Legislative Task Force on Quality Afterschool Programming, the Maine Commission for Community Service, and the Blaine House Conference on Volunteerism. Through his years of work with the Governor’s Children’s Cabinet, he supported hundreds of community initiatives across the state designed to improve the lives of children.

He has supported many local organizations including Our Town Belfast, Belfast Parks and Recreation Commission, and the Belfast Maskers in volunteer and leadership roles throughout the years. For the past 24 years, he has also volunteered as a set builder for Searsport District High School’s Theater Department. Chip is the past Chair of the Maine Community Foundation’s Waldo County Fund, has served as co-Chair of the UU Church of Belfast, and has served as an adult partner for the midcoast’s Youth Leadership Advisory Team.
