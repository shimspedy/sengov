James Boyle is a member of the Democratic Party and represents District 109 in the Maine House of Representatives. He is currently serving his second term in the Maine House of Representatives, having previously served for two years in the Maine Senate. He is a member of the Energy, Utility and Technology Committee.

Boyleâ€™s love for the Maine outdoors inspired him to become a forester and wetland scientist. After graduating from the University of Maine in 1981 with a degree in forest management, he began his career as a forester in the North Maine Woods. In 1996, he opened his first environmental consulting company. Over the years, he has owned several small businesses aimed at protecting the environment. Today, Boyle owns and operates Environmental Permitting and Inspection, LLC.

He has served on the Efficiency Maine Trust Board of Directors, on the board of the Presumpscot Regional Land Trust, and as president of the Maine Association of Wetland Scientists. He and his wife, Sue, live in Gorham. Their four children and five grandchildren all live in Maine.

Boyle assumed office on December 7, 2022, and his current term ends on December 4, 2024. He won the general election on November 8, 2022. Prior to this, he also ran in a special election to represent District 27 in the Maine House of Representatives, which he won in the special general election on January 11, 2022. In July 2017, Boyle declared that he would run for governor of Maine in 2018, but he dropped out of the race in February 2018. He graduated from Simsbury High School in 1976 and has worked as an environmental consultant.
