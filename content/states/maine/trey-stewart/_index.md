Senator Harold “Trey” Stewart III, Esq., is the Senate Republican Leader and serving his second term in the Maine Senate representing the constituents of Senate District 2. The newly reapportioned district includes municipalities and unorganized territories of southern Aroostook County and northern Penobscot County.

Prior to his service in the Senate, he represented the people of District 147 for two terms in the Maine House of Representatives. While there, he was the Assistant House Republican Leader during the 129th Legislature.

Sen. Stewart is a 2012 graduate of Presque Isle High School and earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Maine in 2016 in Political Science and Sociology, the same year he was first elected to the House of Representatives. After completing his MBA during his first term in the Legislature, he has since graduated from the University of Maine School of Law and passed the state bar exam in the summer of 2022.

During his two terms in the Maine House, Sen. Stewart was the youngest member of the Maine Legislature – a distinction he still holds today as the youngest member of the Senate. While in the House, he served on the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, the Taxation Committee and the statewide Opioid Task Force. During his first term in the Senate, he was the Senate Republican Lead for the Energy, Utilities, and Technology Committee and the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee.

Prior to his time in the Legislature, he worked in the Office of Congressman Bruce Poliquin and for the Aroostook Partnership and Northern Maine Development Commission.

In addition to his career and legislative service, Sen. Stewart is also a member of the Presque Isle Rotary Club, the Central Aroostook Chamber of Commerce and Trinity Masonic Lodge #130. He is also a board member for the Aroostook County Action Program; the Northern Maine Community College Foundation; University of Maine at Presque Isle’s visitors board; American Legislative Exchange Council; and National Conference of State Legislatures. He is also the Maine commissioner for the Northeast Forest Fire Protection Compact and previously served as a volunteer for the Presque Isle Fire Department for five years.

Sen. Stewart lives in Presque Isle. He spends his spare time traveling around Maine and the country, as well as reading, snowmobiling, hunting, fishing and at camp with friends and family.
