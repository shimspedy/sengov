Anne Graham, a member of the Democratic Party, is currently serving her third non-consecutive term in the Maine House of Representatives, representing District 105. She had previously served from 2010 to 2014.

She is a resident of North Yarmouth and has been an active member of the community for nearly three decades. Before her political career, she worked as a pediatric nurse practitioner for over 35 years and is now retired.

In her role as a representative, she sits on the Health and Human Services Committee and is the House chair of the Committee on Bills in the Second Reading. She has a strong commitment to working across the aisle and achieving bipartisan cooperation whenever possible. This was evident during her previous terms, when she sponsored nine pieces of bipartisan legislation.

Anne Graham and her husband are parents to three adult sons. She continues to be an active volunteer in Gray, North Yarmouth, and across the state, and has served on the North Yarmouth Select Board. Her dedication to public service is further demonstrated by her extensive volunteer service experience.

Her educational background includes a Bachelor’s degree from Boston College in 1981 and a Master’s degree from Yale University in 1986. She assumed office on December 7, 2022, and her current term ends on December 4, 2024. She was victorious in the general election for Maine House of Representatives District 105 on November 8, 2022.
