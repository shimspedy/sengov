John Andrews is an American politician who has served as a Representative in the Maine House of Representatives since 2018. Initially elected as a Republican to represent the 73rd district, he transitioned to the Libertarian Party in 2020, citing dissatisfaction with the house committee assignments. In 2022, Andrews returned to the Republican Party and successfully ran for re-election in the newly redrawn Maine House district 79.

In 2018, he entered the Maine House as a Republican and later switched to the Libertarian Party after being re-elected in 2020, making history as the first Libertarian to serve in either chamber of the Maine Legislature. His return to the Republican Party in 2022 was influenced by the removal of the Libertarian Party of Maine as an officially recognized party in the state.

On a personal note, Andrews resides in Paris, Maine, with his wife, Jeannette Andrews, and their two children. He earned a B.A. from the University of New Hampshire in 2001.
