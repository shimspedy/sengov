Sen. Dave LaFountain is a lifelong Winslow resident with over 40 years of experience in public service. As a career firefighter and as Winslow and Waterville Fire Chief, he spent his career serving families in Central Maine the best of times and the hardest of times.

A graduate of Winslow High School, Sen. LaFountain has deep roots in his community. His father was a public school teacher, and his mother was a secretary at Thayer Hospital. Growing up, Sen. LaFountain and his four siblings quickly learned the value of hard work and living on a budget. His working-class upbringing instilled in him a sense of responsibility and commitment to prioritizing doing the right thing. He took these lessons directly into his work in the fire service where he oversaw hundreds of local employees and two municipal budgets worth over $2 million.

Sen. LaFountain also supervised the operations of the Central Maine Emergency Response Team that was subject to respond primarily to HAZMAT calls in Kennebec and Somerset Counties. He also trained with the Maine Army National Guard’s 11th Weapons of Mass Destruction – Civil Support Team based in Waterville. Sen. LaFountain also served on the Central Maine Incident Management Team, a group of Regional First Responders responsible for managing safety and management at the scene of large-scale incidents. For 35 years, he enjoyed serving as a Senior Fire Instructor for Maine Fire Training and Education delivering classes around the state to our First Responders.

Sen. LaFountain is happily married to his wife of 40 years, Lee Ann, a retired self-employed hairdresser. Dave and Lee Ann raised their two daughters, Marie and Bethany, right in their hometown of Winslow. They also have four grandchildren.

Sen. LaFountain is serving his first term in the Maine Senate, representing Albion, Fairfield, Oakland, Waterville, and Winslow.
