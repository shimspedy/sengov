Rep. Matthew Beck is serving his second term in the Maine House of Representatives.

A graduate of State University of New York at Binghamton, Beck worked briefly at a number of radio stations before taking a job first at a local public television station and then at a CBS affiliate.

In 1987, Beck was hired by WGME Channel 13 as a Television Producer and Director. Over a nearly 20-year career, he received numerous awards for his work on news, sports, public affairs and special programming, including more than a dozen telethons for the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the Childrenâ€™s Miracle Network at Maine Medical Center.

In 2006, Beck started a new career as a union organizer with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. He worked in Maine and New Hampshire, meeting with workers who wanted to build better lives for themselves and their families by joining a union. He retired from IBEW Local 1837 after 17 years.

Beck lives in South Portland with his wife, Denise. They raised three children.
