John Schickel, born on March 29, 1954, in Union County, Kentucky, is an American Republican politician. He has been serving as a member of the Kentucky State Senate, representing the 11th District since 2009.

Schickel grew up in a family of 11 brothers and sisters, where getting along with others was a requirement. His tight-knit family roots shaped the man he has become today and he is always ready to get involved in his community, helping the local families that make Boone County a true home.

He earned a Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) degree from Northern Kentucky University and a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1976 from the University of Kentucky.

Schickel served in law enforcement for 40 years as a Florence police officer, elected Boone County jailer, and U.S. Marshall. He has been an active member of the Fraternal Order of Police, as a member, past president, and advocate in Frankfort.

As a jail administrator, John created the Boone County Jail Work Program. The work program allows inmates to put time and effort into rejuvenating the local county through cutting grass, litter pickup, and general cleanup. This program has a national reputation for efficient use of county funds. John also oversaw the construction of the Boone County Jail work camp that was built by inmate labor and houses 64 inmates.

Because of John’s extensive background in law enforcement, he was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002 to oversee the U.S. Marshall Service in the Eastern District of Kentucky. This presidential appointment caused John to travel from the Lexington headquarters to field offices in Covington, Ashland, Pikeville, London, and Frankfort. During this time, John came to better understand what concerns our Kentucky residents and he ran for office in 2008 to represent Boone County in the state Senate.

With a reputation as a workhorse in the Senate, John is the current Chairman of the Licensing, Occupations, & Administrative Regulations Committee. All business regulation in the Commonwealth must pass through this committee and John uses his position to fight for good business policy in Frankfort. For his work on the committee, John has been recognized as a champion for Kentucky’s small businesses.

John is current Chairman of the Northern Kentucky Legislative Caucus – a group of Northern Kentucky's officials working together to help shape the region. In this position, John fights for local issues pertaining to infrastructure, school funding, pandemic planning, tourism, the local airport, and universities. The caucus advocates for the entire area and puts party politics aside to discuss the issues that weigh heavily on our hardworking residents.
