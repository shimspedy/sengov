Erika Marie Hancock, born on July 16, 1978, is an American politician who serves as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, representing the 57th district. Her term began on January 1, 2025, following the retirement of incumbent representative Derrick Graham. Hancock's district comprises part of Franklin County.

Hancock's political career took off when she was elected in the 2024 Kentucky House of Representatives election. She defeated Kristie Powe in the Democratic primary and went on to win against Republican candidate Kyle T. Thompson in the general election with 54.4 percent of the vote.

Before her political career, Hancock earned a bachelor's degree in integrated strategic communications from the University of Kentucky. She quickly became one of the youngest female State Farm agents, assuming control of Sallye Hill Stumbo's office in 2001. Hancock has been actively involved in her community, serving on various boards, including the United Way, Sunshine Center, and the Site-Based Decision-Making Council for Bondurant Middle School. She has also contributed to the finance committee at First United Methodist Church.

In the General Assembly, Hancock serves on several committees, including Elections, Constitutional Amendments & Intergovernmental Affairs, Natural Resources & Energy, State Government, Sub-committee on Personnel, Public Retirement, & Finance, Banking & Insurance, and the Tobacco Settlement Agreement Fund Oversight Committee.

Hancock and her husband, Franklin County Clerk Jeff Hancock, have been married for 23 years and have two children: Pauli, a 2022 Frankfort High School graduate and sophomore at the University of Louisville, and Houston, a sophomore at Frankfort High School. Hancock's dedication to her community and her commitment to public service have made her a respected figure in Kentucky politics.
