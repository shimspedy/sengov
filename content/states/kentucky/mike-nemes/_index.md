Mike Nemes, born on February 20, 1954, is an American politician who has been serving in the Kentucky State Senate representing the 38th Senate district since January 28, 2020. Before his tenure in the Senate, he served in the Kentucky House of Representatives representing the 38th House district from January 2011 to January 2013.

Nemes understands the problems Kentuckians face every day. He has been both a business owner and a union member, giving him a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities in the state. After more than 40 years in business, Nemes ran for state representative to make Kentucky a better place to work and do business. He was later appointed to Kentucky’s Labor Cabinet, where he continued this mission of workforce development.

With over 40 years of business experience, Nemes understands the significant burden caused by high taxes, especially on middle-class, working people. He has a record of strengthening the workforce and was appointed second in command of the state’s Labor Cabinet in 2015.

As a former State Representative in District 38, Nemes knows how to get the job done in Frankfort. He was also a teamster union steward, giving him firsthand knowledge of the problems workers face. He is 100% Pro-Life and Pro-Gun, values he was raised on and continues to protect.

All four of his children attended public schools, and Nemes sees the struggle our teachers face when resources do not meet the needs of the classroom. He is married with four children and six grandchildren. While in the private sector, he was a real estate investor. He also worked as a union employee and steward. He owned his own business and worked in construction as a project coordinator.

In 2010, Nemes was elected State Representative for District 38. By 2015, he was appointed second in command of the state’s Labor Cabinet. Today, Nemes's priority is to use his experiences up at the Capitol, where he will fight to bring better opportunities to the people of Bullitt and Jefferson County.
