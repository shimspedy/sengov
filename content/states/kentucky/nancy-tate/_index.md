Before entering politics, she worked for the United Parcel Service. She is a successful businesswoman, Kentucky native and fiscal conservative dedicated to limiting the size of government in our lives. Having lived in Meade County for over 20 years, Nancy Tate is a huge proponent of making new opportunities within one’s home community.

She assumed office on January 1, 2019. Her current term ends on January 1, 2025. Tate is running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 27. The Republican primary for this office on May 21, 2024, was canceled.

In terms of education, she earned a bachelor of arts in business administration from Mid-Continent University and a master's degree in project management from George Washington University.

Throughout her tenure, Tate has been assigned to various committees. In the 2023-2024 term, she was assigned to the House Agriculture Committee, Small Business & Information Technology Committee, and House State Government Committee. In the 2021-2022 term, she was assigned to the House Agriculture Committee, Health and Family Services Committee, and Small Business & Information Technology Committee. In the 2019-2020 term, she was assigned to the House Agriculture Committee, Health and Family Services Committee, and Small Business & Information Technology Committee.

Tate holds staunch anti-abortion views, chairing the Kentucky House's pro-life caucus. In 2022, she promoted a constitutional amendment that would have clarified the Constitution of Kentucky does not “secure or protect a right to abortion ”.
