Savannah Lee Maddox, born on November 2, 1987, is an American politician. She is a member of the Republican party and represents District 61 in the Kentucky House of Representatives. This district includes Grant County, Gallatin County, and parts of Kenton and Boone Counties. Maddox is viewed as one of the General Assembly's furthest-right members.

Born and raised in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Savannah's family has called Grant County home for over six generations. She has been married to her husband Eldon Maddox for over 15 years, and they live on a farm in Dry Ridge along with their two children.

After graduating high school, Savannah dedicated her studies to the history of our nation, its founding, and the principles and sacrifice that have led up to this point. She attended Northern Kentucky University in her home state, where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in both History and International Relations.

Savannah Maddox is many things… a patriot, a conservative, and a fighter… but above all Savannah is a Christian. The Maddox family attends Family Bible Church in Williamstown, where her husband serves as a deacon. Savannah’s Christian faith is the cornerstone of her beliefs and values, and serves as the basis for her commitment to principled leadership.

As a member of the Kentucky General Assembly, she has fought for the unborn, passed Constitutional Carry, never voted for a tax increase, passed the Campus Free Speech Act, fought big government overreach, and so much more. Savannah’s unyielding determination to protect our constitutional rights and liberties has set a precedent for what Kentuckians should expect when they put their trust in a public servant.

Savannah Maddox is an Authentic Republican Fighter. Her proven conservative leadership has been at the forefront of the fight for Kentucky’s families. Savannah’s Proven Conservative Record speaks for itself. Kentucky Patriots know that we have God-given and constitutional rights that must always be defended from the Tyrant Governor, Joe Biden, and their socialist allies. Savannah is ready to continue the fight by protecting the unborn, defending our Second Amendment Rights, eliminating the income tax, cutting wasteful government spending, minimizing excessive government oversight in businesses and agriculture, and backing law enforcement.
