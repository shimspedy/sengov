Rachel Roarx is a dedicated public servant and the State Representative for Kentucky House District 38. She was elected to this position in November 2022 and began her service in January 2023. Rachel lives in the Parkwood Neighborhood with her husband Derrick Davis. They are lifelong Southend residents and high school sweethearts.

Rachel ran for office because she is a strong voice for labor, first responders, healthcare, safety, infrastructure, and the Southend. In her first legislative session, Rachel worked across the political aisle as the Primary Co-Sponsor of HB 191 pertaining to vacancies of Louisville Metro Councilmembers. The bill requires an election rather than an appointment to fill the vacancies.

Before her tenure as a State Representative, Rachel served the local community in the Office of Councilwoman Nicole George as the Metro Council District 21 Legislative Aide. Prior to that, Rachel worked at UPS as an Administrative Assistant on nightshift.

Rachel is a graduate of Holy Cross High School and the University of Louisville. While there, she majored in Political Science concentrated in Law and Public Policy with a minor in Social Change. Rachel spent six years supporting youth in Jefferson County through her board service with Louisville Girls Leadership.

When she is not serving District 38 in Frankfort, Rachel works as a contract worker for Louisville Independent Business Alliance (LIBA) and formerly served as the Executive Director of the Southwest Dream Team (SWDT). In her free time, she serves as the nonprofit Board President of the Little Loomhouse.

Rachel has a proven track record for fostering bi-partisan support in Frankfort and being responsive to constituents. She is running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 38. The election will be held on November 5, 2024.
