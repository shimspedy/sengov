Richard White, born on November 4, 1952, is an American lumberman and politician from Kentucky. He is a member of the Republican party and represents District 99 in the State House.

White won the special election for House District 99 on February 25, 2020, defeating Democrat Bill Redwine. He assumed office on March 3, 2020, succeeding Rocky Adkins.

Before his political career, White founded Richard White Wood Products in 1976. He has created jobs, grown companies, and seized opportunity. His professional experience includes being a business owner, president, and developer.

As a pro-life Christian, Richard stands firm against those who would tear down our values. He is an authentic Eastern Kentucky success story, taking his conservative principles and entrepreneurial spirit to Frankfort.

In terms of his service, White has been a part of various committees. He has served as the Vice Chair of the House Session Standing Committee Natural Resources & Energy and as a member of the Small Business & Information Technology and Tourism & Outdoor Recreation committees. He is also a member of the Mountain Caucus, Kentucky Sportsmen's Caucus, Kentucky-Israel Caucus, and Pro-Life Caucus.

In February 2022, White was hospitalized under critical condition in Frankfort, Kentucky for internal bleeding. As of now, he is running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 99. The Republican primary for this office on May 21, 2024, was canceled.
