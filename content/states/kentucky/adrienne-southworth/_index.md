Adrienne Southworth is an American politician from Kentucky. She is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 7 in the Kentucky State Senate. She assumed office on January 1, 2021.

Born on April 18, 1988, Southworth has been involved in politics from a young age. She made her debut speech in front of a Senate committee in 2009 and read her first state legislation in 2007. Known now as Kentucky Senator for District 7, Adrienne Southworth is a veteran of the Frankfort Capitol complex.

Southworth earned an undergraduate degree from Louisiana Baptist University in 2006. Her career experience includes working as the deputy chief of staff for former Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky Jenean M. Hampton, a music instructor, and a graphic designer.

In her political career, Southworth has been known for her controversial stances. After Donald Trump lost the 2020 election and refused to concede, Southworth promoted falsehoods and conspiracy theories about election fraud. In February 2021, Southworth filed Senate Bill 158 as its sole sponsor, looking to ban the mandate of face mask requirements during a state of emergency amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Kentucky. She has also spoken out against compulsory vaccinations and proposed an amendment to Senate Bill 2 that would prohibit health facilities from requiring employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

In 2024, Southworth introduced a bill that sought to prevent students from using college IDs as a primary source of identification when voting at the polls. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams criticized the bill, saying it would reduce turnout among young people.

Southworth is running for re-election to the Kentucky State Senate to represent District 7. She is on the ballot in the Republican primary.
