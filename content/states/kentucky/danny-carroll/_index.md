Danny Carroll, born on November 4, 1963, in Paducah, Kentucky, is an American politician who has been serving in the Kentucky Senate from the 2nd district since 2015. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Carroll's early life was spent in Paducah, Kentucky. He completed his high school education at Marshal County High School in 1981. Later, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Murray State University in 2004.

In his professional life, Carroll has worked as the president and CEO of Easter Seals West Kentucky. He has also been a member of several local organizations, including the Paducah Lions Club, the Leadership Paducah Alumni Association, the Briensburg Masonic Lodge, and Ducks Unlimited.

During his tenure as a state senator, Carroll has been involved in several significant legislative actions. In early 2019, he withdrew a bill that would have put strict limits on access to public records. He later claimed that he did not write this bill. In 2021, Carroll proposed a bill which would make it a crime to insult or taunt a police officer.

Over the years, Carroll has served on various committees in the Kentucky State Senate. These include the Senate Education Committee, the Committee on Families and Children, the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, and the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Carroll's dedication to public service and his contributions to the state of Kentucky have made him a respected figure in the political landscape. His work continues to impact the lives of the people in his district and the state of Kentucky.
