Jared S. Bauman is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives since January 2023. He represents Kentucky's 28th House district.

Bauman was born on September 15, 1984. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Communication from the University of Louisville in 2008. He went to St. Xavier High School and is a parishioner at a Catholic church.

Before his political career, Bauman worked as a Continuous Improvement Manager with The Lubrizol Corporation and an Automotive Accounts Manager with Steel Technologies. His professional experience includes working as an Operational Excellence Manager.

Bauman's political journey began when he was elected on November 8, 2022, in the 2022 Kentucky House of Representatives election against incumbent Democratic opponent Charles Miller. He assumed office in January 2023.

In January 2024, Bauman introduced HB5, the "Safer Kentucky Act", which would increase penalties for a number of crimes. It would allow property owners to engage in violence against those camping on their property and authorize "deadly physical force" when the property owner thinks someone is trying to "dispossess" them of their property or is trying to commit robbery or arson.

Bauman is a member of the Republican Party and is currently running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 28. The Republican primary for this office on May 21, 2024, was canceled. His current term ends on January 1, 2025.
