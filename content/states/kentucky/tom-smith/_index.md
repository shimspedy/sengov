Tom Smith is an American politician who has been serving in the Kentucky House of Representatives since 2021. He represents the 86th district. This is not his first term in office, as he previously represented the same district from 1991 to 1993.

During his initial term, Smith's political career took a turn when he was convicted of extortion. Following his conviction, he resigned from his position and served 27 months in prison. Despite this setback, Smith made a successful political comeback. He was re-elected in 2020 and assumed office on January 1, 2021.

In addition to his political career, Smith is also known for his committee assignments. During the 2023-2024 term, he was assigned to several committees including the House Banking and Insurance Committee, Licensing, Occupations, and Administrative Regulations Committee, House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, and the House Transportation Committee.

Smith's political journey has been marked by resilience and dedication to his role as a representative. His current term ends on January 1, 2025. He is running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 86. The Republican primary is scheduled for May 21, 2024.
