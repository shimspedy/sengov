James Thomas Payne, born on June 12, 1998, in Reed, Kentucky, is an American politician and educator. He is currently serving as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives for the 11th district, having assumed office on January 1, 2025. His district includes all of Henderson County.

Payne was raised in Reed, an unincorporated community in Henderson County. He graduated from Henderson County High School in 2016 and went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture from Murray State University in 2019. During his time at Murray State, Payne was elected student body president and served as the student representative on the university's board of regents. He also chaired the Kentucky Board of Student Body Presidents.

Following his graduation, Payne was hired by Henderson County High School, where he initially worked as an agriculture teacher and advisor to the school's Future Farmers of America chapter. He later returned to Murray State University to earn a Master of Arts in Education in teacher leadership in 2021 and another M.A.Ed in educational administration in 2024. Currently, Payne serves as the Assistant Principal for Career and Technical Education at Henderson County High School.

In the 2024 elections, the incumbent for Kentucky's 11th House district, Jonathan Dixon, chose not to seek reelection. Payne ran unopposed in both the Republican primary and the general election, winning the latter with 14,964 votes. His political career officially began on January 1, 2025, when he assumed office as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives.

Throughout his career, Payne has been recognized for his contributions to education and his community. He was named Henderson Rookie Educator of the Year in 2021 and was included in the Henderson Chamber of Commerce's "20 under 40" list in 2023. Additionally, he was a fellow of the Henderson Leadership Initiative in 2021 and received the "Teachers Turn the Key" award from the Kentucky Association of Agricultural Educators in 2022.

Payne's dedication to education and public service has made him a respected figure in his community. As a legislator, he continues to advocate for policies that support education, agriculture, and the well-being of his constituents in Henderson County.
