Susan Tyler Witten, born on July 12, 1970, is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives since January 2023. She represents Kentucky's 31st House district.

Witten was elected on November 8, 2022, in the 2022 Kentucky House of Representatives election against Democratic opponent Sue Foster and Independent opponent Chris Adelmann. She assumed office on January 1, 2023. There was a controversy during her election campaign as she was removed from the ballot because her two required signatures to run were not living in district 31. However, a judge reversed the decision and she was let back on.

In terms of her political positions, Witten supports School choice. She earned a bachelor's degree in business management from Transylvania University in 1992. She identifies as a Christian.

Before her political career, Witten worked as a lighting and energy specialist with CED, an account executive with iHeart Media, and a department sales manager with Federated Department Stores.

As of now, she is serving her term which will end on January 1, 2025. She is also running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 31. The Republican primary for this office on May 21, 2024, was canceled.
