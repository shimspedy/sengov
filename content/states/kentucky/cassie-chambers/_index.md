Cassie Chambers Armstrong is an American politician who is a member of the Democratic Party. She has been representing District 19 in the Kentucky Senate since March 2, 2023. Prior to her tenure in the Kentucky Senate, she served as a member of the Louisville Metro Council from January 1, 2021, until she won a special election on February 21, 2023, to fill the state Senate vacancy left by U.S. Representative Morgan McGarvey.

Armstrong was born into poverty in eastern Kentucky. Her parents took her home from the hospital to a rented trailer. With the help of a strong community, a supportive family, and access to public education, she was able to graduate from Yale University, the London School of Economics, and Harvard Law School.

Instead of cashing in on her education at a big law firm, Armstrong came back to Kentucky and started her career providing free legal aid to low-income people experiencing domestic violence. As a member of Louisville Metro Council, Armstrong has passed over 80 laws benefiting the community. These include paid parental leave for Metro employees, legal representation for renters facing eviction, and a safety zone outside of Kentuckyâ€™s abortion clinics to protect women seeking reproductive healthcare from threats and harassment.

Armstrong lives in Louisville, Kentucky. She is an assistant professor of law at the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law. She continues to bring her personal and professional experiences to Frankfort to fight for families across Kentucky.
