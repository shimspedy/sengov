In 2023, she sponsored HB470, an act that would deny gender transition services to minors in the state of Kentucky. Decker was criticized in 2024 for claiming that her father had grown up as a white slave. She later apologized, saying that she should have used a different word.

Jennifer Decker earned a B.A. and M.A. from Eastern Kentucky University and a J.D. from the University of Kentucky. Decker's career experience includes working as an attorney, the executive director of Operation Care Inc., and co-owner of Decker Quality Stock Farm.

She has volunteered with the Shelbyville Rotary Club, Whitney M. Young Community Liaison Council, and Cattlemen's Association. Decker was assigned to several committees including the House Education Committee, Elections, Const. Amendments & Intergovernmental Affairs Committee, Committee on Families and Children, House Judiciary Committee, Vice Chair Education Committee, Health and Family Services Committee, Judiciary Committee, and State Government Committee.

Decker is running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 58. The Republican primary for this office on May 21, 2024, was canceled. Incumbent Jennifer Decker and Richard Henderson are running in the general election for Kentucky House of Representatives District 58 on November 5, 2024.
