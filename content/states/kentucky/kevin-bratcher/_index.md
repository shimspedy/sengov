Kevin D. Bratcher (born 1961 in Louisville, Kentucky) is an American politician and a Republican member of the Kentucky House of Representatives representing District 29 since January 1997. He was the first Republican House Majority Whip in Kentucky history (the position wasn't created until 1933). Currently, Bratcher is the Chairman of the House Elections, Constitutional Amendments and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee.

Bratcher's professional experience includes working as a supervisor and technical instructor. He served as a Sailor in the United States Navy from 1985 to 1991. Bratcher has been a member of the Freemasons and the Kentucky Railway Museum.

Bratcher earned his BS from Embryâ€“Riddle Aeronautical University, his MA in media communications from Webster University and his AAS in Mechanical Engineering Technology from the Louisville Technical Institute.

In terms of his political career, Bratcher won the November 5, 1996 General election against Democratic nominee John Flood after incumbent representative Dave Stengel retired to run for Commonwealth's Attorney. He has since won numerous elections and has served on various committees including the Elections, Const. Amendments & Intergovernmental Affairs Committee, House Judiciary Committee, Licensing, Occupations, and Administrative Regulations Committee, and House State Government Committee.

Bratcher is not seeking reelection in 2024, and is instead running for the Louisville Metro Council. His current term ends on January 1, 2025.
