Stephen L. Meredith was born on June 21, 1953, in Leitchfield, Kentucky. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration and accounting from Western Kentucky University and a Master of Health Administration from the University of Minnesota.

Before entering politics, Meredith served as the CEO of the Twin Lakes Regional Medical Center. His political career began with unsuccessful runs for the Kentucky House of Representatives in 2012 and 2014. However, his perseverance paid off when he was elected to the Kentucky Senate from the 5th district in November 2016, assuming office in January 2017.

In the Senate, Meredith has held several key positions. He serves as the chair of the Budget Review Subcommittee on Human Resources. He also serves as vice chair of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee and Senate Veterans, Military Affairs, and Public Protection Committee. He is co-chair of the Senate Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Committee and Senate Government Contract Review Committee.

Meredith's commitment to public service extends beyond his political career. He has been the president of the Grayson County Alliance and a member of the Grayson County Rotary Club, the Grayson County Small Business Boosters, and the chamber of commerce in different Kentucky counties.

As of now, Meredith is running for re-election to the Kentucky State Senate to represent District 5. He is on the ballot in the Republican primary.
