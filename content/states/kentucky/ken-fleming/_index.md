Ken Fleming is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from the 48th district. He was elected in November 2020 and assumed office on January 1, 2021.

Before his current term, Fleming had previously served in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 2017 to 2019. He was also a member of the Louisville Metro Council from 2003 to 2015. His political career has seen him serve in various capacities and he has made significant contributions to his community through his roles.

Fleming's educational background includes a Bachelor of Business Administration which he earned from the University of Kentucky. This education has undoubtedly played a role in shaping his political career and his approach to governance.

Before entering politics, Fleming held several positions in the private sector. He worked as the president of the Management Association for Private Photogrammetric Surveyors and was the executive director of Kilgore Samaritan Counseling Center in Louisville, Kentucky. These roles allowed him to gain valuable experience and skills that he would later bring to his political career.

In November 2016, Fleming was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives. However, in 2018, he was narrowly defeated for re-election by Sorolis in a rematch. Undeterred, Fleming ran again in 2020 and managed to defeat Sorolis in another close election. He assumed office in January 2021 and has been serving the people of the 48th district since then.

Throughout his career, Fleming has shown a commitment to serving his community and working towards the betterment of his constituents. His work in the Kentucky House of Representatives and the Louisville Metro Council is a testament to his dedication and service.
