Walker Thomas (born August 13, 1963) is an American politician who has served in the Kentucky House of Representatives from the 8th district since 2017. He was first elected in 2016, defeating incumbent representative Jeffrey R. Taylor. Thomas had previously lost a special election to Taylor earlier that year.

Born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, Thomas earned a bachelor of business administration from Austin Peay State University. His career experience includes working with Kentucky Moving and Storage and as President and Assistant Governor with the Rotary Club. He has been a member of the Salvation Army and the Military Affairs Committee. Thomas was elected to serve on the Hopkinsville City Council.

In addition to his political career, Thomas has also been involved in local business and has shown a deep commitment to civic engagement. He brings experienced and trusted leadership to the Kentucky Legislature on behalf of Caldwell, Christian, and Trigg Counties.

During his tenure, Thomas has been assigned to various committees including the House Agriculture Committee, House Local Government Committee, House Transportation Committee, and House Veterans, Military Affairs, and Public Protection Committee. He has served as Chair for some of these committees.

However, his career has not been without controversy. In February 2022, during a committee meeting, Thomas and committee chair Sen. Rick Girdler made use of an inappropriate phrase to refer to bargaining for a lower price on a lease. This was picked up on a hot mic and reported by the Lexington Herald-Leader. Thomas later apologized, saying that the remark was "not who he was."

As of now, Thomas is running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 8.
