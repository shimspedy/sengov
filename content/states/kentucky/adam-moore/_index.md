Adam Christopher Moore, born on November 30, 1984, in Frankfort, Kentucky, is an American politician who has served as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives since January 1, 2025. Representing the 45th district, which includes parts of Fayette and Jessamine Counties, Moore has quickly made a name for himself in the political arena.

Moore's journey to public office began with his education at Western Hills High School, followed by earning a bachelor's degree from Murray State University in 2007. His commitment to service was evident early on, as he joined the U.S. Army Reserve in 2007, serving until 2013. During his time in the Army, Moore was deployed to Africa and Afghanistan, experiences that deepened his understanding of the sacrifices and commitments required of servant leaders.

After his military service, Moore transitioned to a career in public service and entrepreneurship. He gained valuable experience working for Kentucky legislators in Washington, D.C., before returning to Kentucky to start his own coaching business. As a coach, Moore has worked with hundreds of new and experienced athletes, helping them achieve their health and fitness goals.

Moore's dedication to his community extends beyond his professional endeavors. He is actively involved in various local organizations, including Lexington's Commission on Veterans Affairs and Kentuckians for the Commonwealth. His commitment to public service is further demonstrated by his involvement with Moms Demand Action and Progress Kentucky.

In the 2024 Kentucky House of Representatives election, Moore ran as a Democratic candidate and won with 50.3 percent of the vote, defeating Republican candidate Thomas Jefferson. This victory marked a significant milestone in his political career, as he succeeded Killian Timoney to become the representative for the 45th district.

As a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, Moore has focused on supporting hardworking families, strengthening public education, expanding access to quality healthcare, and safeguarding individual freedoms. His dedication to these key areas reflects his commitment to building a stronger, more prosperous Kentucky for everyone.

Moore resides in the Dogwood Trace neighborhood with his wife, Andrea, and their son, Remy. Married since 2014, the couple is dedicated to raising their son in a loving and supportive environment. Moore's deep roots in Central Kentucky and his unwavering commitment to public service make him a respected and influential figure in the Kentucky House of Representatives.
