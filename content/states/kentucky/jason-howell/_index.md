Howell earned his Juris Doctor (JD) from the University of Kentucky College of Law, and his Bachelor of Arts (BA) from The University of the South. He is married to Renee and they have three children.

Before entering politics, Howell worked as an attorney. In December 2019, he announced that he would be a candidate for the Kentucky State Senate in Kentucky's 1st State Senate district in 2020. The incumbent State Senator Stanley H. Humphries had announced that he would not be seeking re-election. The Republican primary for the seat was cancelled due to Howell being the only candidate. He was elected unopposed in the November 3, 2020 general election and was sworn into office on January 1, 2021.

He represents the 1st Senate District, which includes Calloway, Crittenden, Fulton, Graves, Hickman, Lyon, and Trigg counties. Senator Howell serves as a member of the Banking and Insurance, Economic Development, Tourism and Labor, and Licensing and Occupations committees. He was recently selected to serve as Chairman of the Senate Agriculture committee.

His current term ends on January 1, 2025. Howell is running for re-election to the Kentucky State Senate to represent District 1. He is on the ballot in the Republican primary.
