Josie Raymond is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She represents District 41 in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Before this, she represented District 31 until new boundaries were drawn during the 2022 election cycle.

Raymond is not seeking reelection to the house in 2024, instead, she is running for the Louisville Metro Council. She has been known for her uncompromising vision for a more inclusive Kentucky, for holding the Republican majority accountable, and for centering women and children.

She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and a Master of Science in Journalism from Columbia University, where she wrote for the campus newspaper, Columbia Daily Spectator. She also holds a Master of Arts in Teaching from Marian University.

Her past experience includes working at the Student Success Center at the University of Louisville and with Teach for America. She has dedicated her career to creating opportunities, particularly pathways to education, for people in poverty. A former recipient of free lunch in JCPS, she has been a middle school teacher, a nonprofit director focused on first-generation college students, and a success coach for struggling students at the University of Louisville.

In each role, including state representative, her mission has been the same: lift up people seeking to build better lives for themselves and their children and break down barriers that stand in their way.

Raymond was elected to represent the 31st district in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 2018, replacing fellow Democrat Steve Riggs, who was retiring. In the 2018 general election for Kentucky House of Representatives, District 31, Raymond secured 59.7% of the votes.

She lives in Hikes Point, with her husband, Adam, a journalist who took her to Manualâ€™s junior prom on their first date, and their three kids. She grew up in the district she represents before earning her degrees.
