Derek Lewis is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives since January 1, 2019. He represents Kentucky's 90th House district and is associated with the Republican Party.

Born in London, Kentucky, Lewis earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting and Communication Arts from the University of the Cumberlands and a Master of Business Administration from Western Kentucky University. His career experience includes working as a small business owner and a pharmacy and residential real-estate business manager.

Lewis has been a member of the EKCEP Workforce Investment Board, the Hyden-Leslie County Chamber of Commerce, and the National Rifle Association. He was first elected in the 2018 Kentucky House of Representatives election and assumed office on January 1, 2019. He was reelected in the 2020 Kentucky House of Representatives election.

In addition to his political career, Lewis has faced some controversy. On April 16, 2020, he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence. He was found in a ditch and appeared to be drunk. The trial was originally scheduled for September 23, 2020; after being postponed three times, it was scheduled for May 19, 2021. Lewis was found not guilty.

As of now, Lewis is running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 90. The Republican primary for this office on May 21, 2024, was canceled. The general election for Kentucky House of Representatives District 90 will be held on November 5, 2024.
