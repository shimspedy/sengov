Emily Callaway is a member of the Republican Party and currently serves as a representative for District 37 in the Kentucky House of Representatives. She assumed office on January 1, 2023, succeeding Jeffery M. Donohue.

Emily Callaway's journey into politics began with her education at Whitefield Academy. Her commitment to public service and her community led her to run for office, where she was elected on November 8, 2022, in the Kentucky House of Representatives election against Democratic opponent Jeffery M. Donohue.

As a legislator, Emily Callaway has been involved in various committees. In the 2023-2024 term, she was assigned to the House Education Committee, Health and Family Services Committee, Licensing, Occupations, and Administrative Regulations Committee, and the Education Committee.

One of the notable moments in her political career was when she introduced a bill that proposed charging women who receive an abortion with criminal homicide. The bill received opposition from both major parties and ultimately failed.

Emily Callaway is running for re-election to continue representing District 37 in the Kentucky House of Representatives. The Republican primary for this office on May 21, 2024, was canceled, and Emily Callaway advanced from the Republican primary for Kentucky House of Representatives District 37.

Outside of her political career, Emily Callaway is a devout Christian and a Baptist. She continues to serve her community and strives to represent the interests of her constituents in the Kentucky House of Representatives.
