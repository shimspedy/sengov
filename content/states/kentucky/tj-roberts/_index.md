Theodore Joseph "T.J." Roberts, born on February 23, 1998, in Edgewood, Kentucky, is a dedicated American politician and attorney. He currently serves as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives for the 66th district, having assumed office on January 1, 2025. Roberts' journey to public service is marked by his commitment to conservative values, legal expertise, and a deep-rooted connection to his community.

Roberts' early life was shaped by his upbringing in Boone County, Kentucky, where his family has lived for generations. He attended Conner High School and later pursued higher education at Transylvania University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2019. His academic journey continued at the Salmon P. Chase College of Law, where he obtained his Juris Doctor in 2023.

Roberts' political career began to take shape during his college years when he actively engaged in conservative advocacy and free speech initiatives. He stood up to his university administration when they suppressed conservative voices, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to protecting constitutional rights. This early experience laid the foundation for his future endeavors in public service.

In the 2024 elections, Roberts ran for the Kentucky House of Representatives in the 66th district. The incumbent, Steve Rawlings, chose not to seek re-election, opting instead to run for the Kentucky Senate. Roberts won the Republican primary with a significant majority, securing 74.2% of the votes against former representative C. Ed Massey. In the general election, he emerged victorious with 70.4% of the votes, defeating Democratic candidate Peggy Houston-Nienaber.

As a state representative, Roberts has been a vocal advocate for conservative principles and individual liberties. He has championed causes such as school choice, constitutional carry, campus free speech, and the abolition of vaccine mandates. Roberts has also been a staunch opponent of tax increases, reckless spending, and infringements on constitutional liberties. His legislative efforts have focused on promoting pro-liberty and anti-corruption measures, reflecting his dedication to serving the people of Kentucky.

Roberts' legal career has been equally impactful. He has worked as an attorney, fighting for liberty in the courts and defending the rights of individuals. His notable achievements include successfully suing Governor Andy Beshear during the COVID-19 lockdowns, challenging restrictions on worship and protest. This victory set a precedent for similar cases across the country, further solidifying Roberts' reputation as a defender of constitutional rights.

Beyond his political and legal endeavors, Roberts is deeply committed to his faith and community. As a Christian, his beliefs have been the cornerstone of his principles and actions. He has actively volunteered in ministry and has sought to serve his community through various initiatives. Roberts' dedication to his constituents is evident in his tireless efforts to protect their rights and freedoms.

Roberts' family background in horse racing has instilled in him the values of hard work, faith, and conservative principles. He resides on a small farm in Burlington, Kentucky, where he continues to advocate for the future of Boone County and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. His journey from a young conservative advocate to a state representative and attorney exemplifies his unwavering commitment to the principles that have shaped his life and career.
