Stephanie A. Dietz, born on February 2, 1969, is an American politician who has been serving in the Kentucky House of Representatives from the 65th district since 2023. She was elected to the seat in the 2022 Kentucky House of Representatives election with 51% of the vote.

Dietz graduated from Woodford County High School in 1987. She then pursued higher education at the University of Kentucky, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in Political Science. Furthering her education, she obtained a Juris Doctor from Northern Kentucky University Salmon P. Chase College of Law in 1994.

In her personal life, Dietz married her husband Jim in 1998. Jim was an Infantryman and is now a lawyer. Together, they reside in Edgewood, Kentucky.

Professionally, Dietz runs a company called Dietz Family Law. In 2014, she made an unsuccessful run for Kenton County Family Court judge. Despite this setback, she continued her political career and eventually won a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives.

As a member of the House, Dietz represents part of northern and central Kenton County in the 65th House District. She is a member of several committees, including the House Veterans, Military Affairs and Public Protection Committee, Families and Children Committee, and Judiciary Committee.

Dietz is a member of the Republican Party and is currently running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 65. Her current term ends on January 1, 2025.
