Joshua Jedidiah Watkins, born on September 27, 1985, in Miami, Florida, is a dedicated American politician and a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives. Representing the 42nd district, which includes part of Jefferson County, Watkins assumed office on January 1, 2025. He succeeded Keturah Herron, who retired to run for the Kentucky Senate.

Watkins' journey into politics began with his education. He attended Murray State University and later earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Kentucky in 2010. His academic pursuits didn't stop there; he went on to obtain a graduate degree from Northcentral University in 2022. This strong educational foundation laid the groundwork for his career in public service.

Before entering the political arena, Watkins gained valuable experience as a government administrator, community advocate, and grassroots organization advisor. His commitment to public service is evident in his involvement with various organizations, including Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, the Waterfront Development Corporation, and the Kentucky College of Art & Design.

In the 2024 Kentucky House of Representatives election, Watkins ran unopposed in the general election, securing his position with a significant majority. His victory in the Democratic primary was equally impressive, where he defeated two other candidates, Jonathan Musselwhite and Jack W. Walker, with 53% of the vote.

As a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, Watkins has focused on issues such as community development, education, and public safety. His dedication to his constituents and his ability to work collaboratively with colleagues from both sides of the aisle have earned him respect and admiration within the political community.

Watkins' term is set to end on January 1, 2027, but he has already declared his candidacy for re-election in the 2026 election. His commitment to serving the people of Kentucky and his passion for making a positive impact on his community continue to drive his political career.

Outside of his professional life, Watkins is known for his strong Christian faith and his dedication to his family. He resides in Louisville, Kentucky, where he remains actively involved in his community, always striving to make a difference in the lives of those he represents.
