Jared K. Carpenter was born on April 26, 1977, in Richmond, Kentucky. He is a Republican member of the Kentucky Senate, representing District 34 since January 2011.

Carpenter's journey into politics began when he won the three-way Republican Primary with 4,405 votes (37.9%) and the three-way general election with 23,553 votes (64.9%) against Democratic nominee Lee Murphy and Evangelical Christian Party candidate Donald VanWinkle. This victory marked the start of his tenure on January 1, 2011, after District 34 Senator Ed Worley retired and left the seat open.

In his role as a senator, Carpenter has made significant contributions to various committees. He is the Chairman of the Senate Banking & Insurance Committee. In addition, he serves on the Agriculture, Transportation, and Natural Resources & Energy Committees. His leadership and active participation in these committees have played a crucial role in shaping policies and making decisions that impact the state of Kentucky.

Away from his political duties in Frankfort, Carpenter is a businessman and farmer residing in Berea with his family. He operates a small rental and development company and a farm in Berea, demonstrating his versatility and commitment to serving his community in multiple capacities.

Carpenter's educational background includes earning his Bachelor of Arts degree from Eastern Kentucky University, where he was a member of the basketball team. His professional experience includes working as a business development officer at First Southern National Bank.

Over the years, Carpenter has successfully run for re-election multiple times. In 2022, he defeated Rhonda Goode in the Republican Primary with 6,086 votes (75.6%). He then went on to defeat his Democratic challenger, Susan Cintra, with 24,140 votes (59.7%). His current term ends on January 1, 2027.

Carpenter's dedication to his role as a senator, his active participation in various committees, and his commitment to his community make him a respected figure in Kentucky politics.
