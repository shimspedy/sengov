Dr. Lisa Willner is a life-long Democrat who has dedicated her career to helping others. She is a graduate of Yale University and received her PhD in Clinical Psychology from the California School of Professional Psychology. Lisa and her husband John Scruton have lived in the 35th House District since 1995 where they raised their two children, Ben and Eliza. Their household now includes their two rescue dogs, Ozzie and Walter.

Lisa and John are members of First Unitarian Church, where Lisa formerly served as Director of Religious Education. Lisa is a strong advocate for mental health issues and until recently served as the Executive Director of the Kentucky Psychology Association. Lisa also taught in the Psychology Department at Bellarmine University for nearly 20 years.

In 2014, Lisa was elected to the Jefferson County School Board where she was praised by educators, mental health professionals and her constituents for advocating for our public schools, and for her focus on mental health issues, advancing Fairness efforts, standing up for student voice and for greater labor/management collaboration. She served as Vice Chair of the School Board, where she listened to all voices, brought board members together, and was known for her hard work.

Lisa was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 2018.

She was the primary author of Trauma-Informed Schools legislation, and has worked on numerous mental health, public education, public safety, and maternal health initiatives. She serves as chair of the House Democratic Women's Caucus.

Lisa has been recognized by the Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression for her work for racial justice, and has received awards from both the American Psychological Association and the Kentucky Psychological Association for her advocacy on behalf of psychology and mental health. In 2021, the Kentucky Association for Psychology in the Schools (KAPS) presented Lisa with the prestigious â€œFriend of KAPS Award." The Kentucky Association for School Social Work named Lisa the 2022 Elected Official of the Year.

Lisa is passionate about children's rights, labor rights, human rights, environmental and economic justice, women's rights, LGBTQ+ Fairness, and standing up for those who need a voice.
