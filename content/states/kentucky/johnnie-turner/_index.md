Johnnie L. Turner, born on December 24, 1947, in Bledsoe, Kentucky, is an American attorney and politician serving as a member of the Kentucky Senate from the 29th district. He was elected in November 2020 and assumed office on January 1, 2021.

Turner's early life was spent in Bledsoe, Kentucky. He pursued his higher education at Union College, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1974. He furthered his education at the University of Kentucky College of Law, earning a Juris Doctor in 1977.

Before embarking on his political career, Turner served as a medic in the United States Army from 1967 to 1969. He later worked as an attorney for the Harlan County Public Schools. In addition to operating a private legal practice, he was also an attorney for the city of Cumberland, Kentucky.

Turner's political career began when he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1998, defeating Democratic incumbent Thomas Pope. However, in the 2002 redistricting cycle, his district was eliminated and redrawn in Lexington. Turner then ran for the Kentucky Senate, but lost to Daniel Mongiardo.

Despite this setback, Turner remained active in politics. He was a candidate for the Kentucky House of Representatives in 2016 but withdrew before the election. His perseverance paid off when he was elected to the Kentucky Senate in November 2020. He assumed office on January 1, 2021, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Turner's contributions to the Kentucky Senate have been significant. He has served on several committees, including the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee, and Senate Transportation Committee.

As of now, Turner is running for re-election to the Kentucky State Senate to represent District 29. He is on the ballot in the Republican primary on May 21, 2024.
