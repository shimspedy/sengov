Lindsey Tichenor, born on January 29, 1977, is an American politician from Kentucky. She is a member of the Republican Party and has been representing District 6 in the Kentucky Senate since January 1, 2023.

Tichenor was born in Louisville, Kentucky. Her career experience includes working as a realtor with Covenant Realty, LLC. She also served as the executive regional vice president of Arbonne International.

In addition to her professional career, Tichenor has a rich background in community service. She served as an international missionary with Water Step/Edge Outreach. She has also been a grass roots community mobilizer, sales executive, and teacher.

Tichenor's motivation to serve as a State Senator is rooted in her drive to reverse the usurpation of Kentuckians’ rights and liberties and restore the power of government to “We The People”.

She has served as a precinct and education chair of the Oldham County GOP and has been a standing member of the Oldham County Republican Women’s Club.

Tichenor ran for election to the Kentucky State Senate to represent District 6 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. Her current term ends on January 1, 2027.

She resides in Smithfield, Kentucky.
