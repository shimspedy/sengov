Matthew Lehman, born on February 27, 1977, in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, is an American politician who currently serves as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, representing the 67th district. His journey into politics began with a strong foundation in education and community involvement. Lehman attended Covington Catholic High School and later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Louisville in 1999. He furthered his education by obtaining a Master of Science degree from Columbia University in 2002.

Lehman's career has been marked by a dedication to public service and healthcare innovation. He co-founded Koligo Therapeutics in 2016, a company focused on developing opioid-free treatments for pancreatitis patients. His work in the medical research field has taken him to various states and even abroad, where he has contributed to the development of new therapeutics to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases.

In 2022, Lehman made his first foray into electoral politics by running for Kentucky's 4th congressional district. Although he was unsuccessful in this bid, losing to incumbent Republican representative Thomas Massie, Lehman remained undeterred. He continued to engage with his community and build his political profile.

Lehman's persistence paid off in the 2024 election when he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, succeeding Rachel Roberts. He won the election with 50.08 percent of the vote, narrowly defeating Republican candidate Terry W. Hatton. Lehman's victory was a testament to his commitment to restoring respectful and responsible leadership in his community.

As a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, Lehman has focused on issues such as healthcare, education, and economic development. He is dedicated to improving the lives of his constituents and ensuring that their voices are heard in the state legislature. Lehman's background in healthcare and his experience as an entrepreneur have equipped him with a unique perspective on the challenges facing his district and the state of Kentucky.

Lehman resides in Newport, Kentucky, with his wife Adriana and their three children. The family returned to Kentucky in 2015 to be closer to their extended family and friends. Lehman is proud of his family's long legacy of contributions to the state, which includes union leaders, small business owners, nurses, teachers, and public servants.

In addition to his legislative duties, Lehman continues to consult with the healthcare industry, helping to develop new treatments and improve patient outcomes. His dedication to public service and his passion for healthcare innovation make him a valuable asset to the Kentucky House of Representatives and the community he serves.
