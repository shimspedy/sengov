Mitchum Addison Whitaker, born on May 12, 1993, in Letcher County, Kentucky, is an American politician and attorney. He currently serves as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, representing the 94th district, which includes Letcher County as well as parts of Harlan and Pike counties. Whitaker assumed office on January 1, 2025, succeeding Jacob Justice.

Whitaker's early life was marked by tragedy when his mother died in a car accident caused by a drunk driver when he was just 17 years old. Despite this, he excelled academically and graduated from Letcher County High School in 2011. He then attended the University of Kentucky, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in agricultural economics with a minor in business in 2015. During his time at the university, Whitaker was actively involved in various organizations, serving as president of Alpha Gamma Rho and a member of the Interfraternal Council. He also completed internships with the Kentucky Department of Agriculture and U.S. Representative Hal Rogers.

Whitaker continued his education at the J. David Rosenberg College of Law, graduating with a Juris Doctor in 2021. While in law school, he served as president of the Appalachian Law Caucus, an at-large representative of the Student Bar Association, and a graduate senator-at-large of the Student Government Association. After graduating, Whitaker began his career as an attorney and, since January 2023, has also served as the city attorney of Fleming-Neon.

In addition to his legal career, Whitaker has been actively involved in his community. He has served as chair of the Letcher County Republican Party and president of the local Mothers Against Drunk Driving advisory board. His dedication to public service and his community led him to run for the Kentucky House of Representatives in 2024. With the incumbent Jacob Justice choosing not to seek reelection, Whitaker was unopposed in both the Republican primary and the general election, winning the latter with 13,492 votes.

As a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, Whitaker is committed to representing the interests of his constituents and working towards the betterment of his district. His background in agricultural economics and law, combined with his personal experiences and dedication to public service, make him a valuable asset to the Kentucky General Assembly. Whitaker's current term ends on January 1, 2027, and he has already declared his candidacy for the 2026 election.
