Pamela D. Stevenson, born on April 8, 1959, is an American politician, attorney, and retired U.S. Air Force Colonel. She is a Democrat and represents District 43 in the State House. In 2023, she unsuccessfully ran as the Democratic nominee in the 2023 Kentucky Attorney General election, losing to the Republican nominee Russell Coleman.

Stevenson was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. She attended Shawnee High School before transferring to Brown High School. She then served 27 years as a Judge Advocate General with the U.S. Air Force and retired with the rank of colonel. Stevenson graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in business from Indiana University Bloomington in 1981, and in 1984 with a Doctorate of Jurisprudence from Indiana University Maurer School of Law.

In 2015, Stevenson founded the Stevenson Law Center, which offers legal representation pro bono to veterans and seniors. Stevenson has also served as an adjunct professor at the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law.

Stevenson was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 2020, replacing Charles Booker, who instead ran for the U.S. Senate. In November 2022, Stevenson announced her candidacy for Attorney General of Kentucky in 2023. She became the presumptive Democratic nominee after no other candidates filed for the Primary, becoming the first African-American woman nominated for the office in Kentucky.

While in the state house, Stevenson became known for her impassioned speeches. In March 2023, a speech she gave in opposition to the passing of Kentucky House Bill 470, which prohibits gender-affirming care for transgender youth and restricts school instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, went viral online. Stevenson made another speech on March 29, 2023, regarding Senate Bill 150, which similar to Kentucky House Bill 470, will prohibit all gender affirming healthcare for transgender people under 18 years of age.

Stevenson is a Christian, and was ordained as a minister in 2023. She serves as an Associate Pastor at the Oak Grove Missionary Baptist Church, in Louisville. She is married to Thomas Shannon, a professional photographer.
