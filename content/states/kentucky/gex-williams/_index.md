Gex Williams, also known as Jay Williams, is an American politician from Kentucky. He is a member of the Republican Party and has represented District 20 in the Kentucky Senate since January 1, 2023. His current term ends on January 1, 2027.

Williams was born on August 22, 1952. He graduated from Fort Lauderdale High School in 1970. He earned a bachelor's degree in computer and information sciences and a master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida in 1975 and 1977, respectively.

His career experience includes working as an IT consultant with Wi2, an executive advisor with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the vice president and an insurance agent with Capitol Marketing Insurance. Williams has been affiliated with the NRA, Christian Home Educators of Kentucky, and Boy Scouts of America.

From 1991 to 1992 Williams represented Kentucky House District 60. In 1993, he served in the Kentucky Senate, representing District 24 until 1998. He ran for Kentucky's 4th congressional district in the 1998 elections, but lost the general election.

In addition to his political career, Williams has worked as a software developer, marketer, and IT consultant. He was elected to the Kentucky General Assembly three times between 1990 and 1998 from Northern Kentucky. Williams claims he helped Republicans take control of the Senate, increased transparency in the legislature, and exposed politicians who said one thing and did another.

Williams resides in Verona, Kentucky. He is a Christian and has had a diverse career spanning various roles in the IT industry. His contributions to the state of Kentucky and his dedication to his constituents have made him a respected figure in the Kentucky State Senate.
