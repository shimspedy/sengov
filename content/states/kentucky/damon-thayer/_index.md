Damon Thayer, born on September 16, 1967, is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He represents the 17th District in the Kentucky Senate.

Thayer was raised in Grayling, Michigan. He pursued his higher education at Michigan State University, graduating in 1989 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications.

After completing his education, Thayer established Thayer Communications and Consulting LLC, a marketing communications firm. His political career began when he served as the vice chairman of the Republican Party of Kentucky from 1999 to 2004.

In 2003, Thayer was elected to the Kentucky Senate in a special election to represent the 17th District, which includes Grant, Scott, and southern Kenton Counties. His leadership and dedication to his role led to his selection as the Senate Majority Floor Leader in 2017.

As a member of the Senate leadership, Thayer serves on several committees, including the Committee on Committees, the Rules Committee, and the Legislative Research Commission. He has also made appearances on popular shows like The Daily Show in 2013.

In March 2020, during the first session of the Kentucky Senate since Democrat Andy Beshear took office as governor, Thayer proposed legislation to limit the powers of the executive branch.

Thayer's contributions to his state and his party have been significant, and his career in the Kentucky Senate continues to be marked by his commitment to his constituents and his party.
