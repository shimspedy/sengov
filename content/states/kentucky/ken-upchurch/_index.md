Ken Upchurch, born on June 4, 1969, is a prominent figure in the political landscape of Kentucky. He is a Republican member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from District 52, which encompasses Wayne, McCreary, and a portion of Pulaski counties in the south-central portion of the state.

Upchurch's political career began in January 1999, when he first assumed office. He held this position until January 2011. After a two-year hiatus, he returned to the position early in 2013. He is currently serving his term, which will end in 2025.

In addition to his political career, Upchurch is an insurance agent with Upchurch Insurance and Financial Services. He was also the owner and publisher of the Monticello Stage, a community newspaper in Monticello, Kentucky.

Upchurch was born in Richmond, Kentucky, and currently resides in Monticello, Kentucky. He is married to Melissa Upchurch, and they have two children, Chelsea and Jackson. He also has two brothers, Keith and Timothy.

He received a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Eastern Kentucky University (EKU). During his time at EKU, he served as the student body president and was an automatic member of the university board of regents.

Upchurch has a reputation for his support of small business and agriculture. In 2002, his colleagues elected him as the House Republican whip, a position which he filled for two terms and helped to craft the state budget.

He did not seek a seventh two-year term in 2010 and was succeeded by fellow Republican, Sara Beth Gregory, a lawyer from Monticello. Instead, Upchurch was defeated in a bid for Wayne County Judge/Executive. After two years in the state House, Gregory won a special election to the Kentucky State Senate in December 2012. Upchurch won back the seat that he had vacated barely two years earlier, when he defeated Democrat Harvey Shearer, also of Monticello in a low-turnout special election held on February 12, 2013.

Upchurch is a member of the Elk Spring Valley Baptist Church in Monticello. His maternal grandfather is Reverend James Howard Jackson of Mt. Orab, Ohio.
