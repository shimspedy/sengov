Ryan Dotson (born November 22, 1972) is an American politician and pastor serving as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from the 73rd district. He was elected in November 2020 and assumed office on January 1, 2021.

Before his political career, Dotson served as a radiologist in the United States Army. After his military service, he transitioned to a career as a senior pastor. His dedication to public service and his community eventually led him to run for office.

In the 2020 election, Dotson ran as a candidate from the Republican Party for the 73rd district of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He won the election and assumed office at the start of 2021. His current term is set to end on January 1, 2025.

During his tenure, Dotson has been assigned to several committees. In the 2023-2024 term, he served as the Vice Chair of the Health and Family Services Committee and was also a member of the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, Small Business & Information Technology Committee, and the Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Committee.

In addition to his committee assignments, Dotson has also authored legislation. One notable piece of legislation he authored in 2021 aimed to ban transgender women from playing on women's sports teams in Kentucky.

Despite his political achievements, Dotson's career has not been without controversy. In 2019, he was scheduled to officiate the wedding of reality TV stars Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright. However, he was later removed from the position after tweets resurfaced that were characterized as anti-LGBT and transphobic.

As of now, Dotson is running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 73. The Republican primary for this office was canceled, and he is set to run in the general election on November 5, 2024.
