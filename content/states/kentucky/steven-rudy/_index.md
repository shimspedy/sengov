While at Murray he was a member of the Future Farmers of America.

In late 2003, Rudy declared his candidacy for the 2004 election for State Representative in Kentucky's 1st Legislative House District. Running against Representative Charles Geveden of Wickliffe, a former prosecutor and Chair of the House State Government Committee with 17 years of service. Rudy launched a campaign against Rep. Geveden, including sending out mailers before the election stating that Geveden was in favor of many liberal social positions. On November 4, 2004, Rudy, buoyed by strong returns from McCracken County, defeated Geveden by around 1500 votes, to be the first ever Republican elected to the seat. Rudy won re-election in 2006 handily, defeating retired Coast Guard veteran Thomas French by over 2000 votes.

In the 2008 session of the Kentucky General Assembly, Rudy introduced legislation that would allow for nuclear plants to be built in Kentucky without having a permanent waste disposal facility, in an attempt to end the state's moratorium on nuclear power plants.

With Rudyâ€™s leadership position, he sets the agenda for prioritizing bills in the state House and controls the flow of legislation and in the chamber. Rudy has served in the role since 2021. Before that, he served as chair of the House Appropriations and Revenue committee. He was first elected to the general assembly in 2004.
