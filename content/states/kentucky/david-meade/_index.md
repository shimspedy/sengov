David Meade is an American politician and a Republican member of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He has been representing District 80 since January 2013. His legislative district includes Lincoln County and part of Pulaski County.

David Meade was born on June 22, 1976. He attended Lexington Community College and the University of Kentucky. In addition to his service as state representative, Meade is a managing broker at Lincoln Realty and Auction Company. He also serves as a member of the National Association of Realtors, Kentucky Association of Realtors, Kentucky Auctioneers Association, Lexington Bluegrass Association of Realtors and the Central Kentucky Association of Realtors.

He is also involved in philanthropic activities. He serves on the Board of Directors for Catalyst Resources International (CRI), an organization that seeks to partner with Guatemalan pastors and other Christian organizations in an effort to meet the physical and spiritual needs of the Guatemalan people. Through the organization, Meade was a founding member of Mimi's House, a CRI property that is used as a housing facility and ministry center in Guatemala.

In the 2012 elections, when District 80 Representative Danny Ford retired and left the seat open, Meade won the four-way Republican Primary and was unopposed for the General election, winning with a significant number of votes. Since then, Meade has faced no opposition.

Shortly after Republicans took control of the Kentucky House of Representatives in November 2016 for the first time in 95 years, Meade was elected Majority Caucus Chairman by the House Republican Caucus. Meade became both the first Republican Majority Caucus Chairman in Kentucky history as well as the first Lincoln County representative to serve in House majority leadership.

After returning after the 2018 elections with a 61-member super majority, House Republicans nominated Meade for Speaker pro tempore, the second-highest position in the House of Representatives. Upon his election by the majority party, Meade remarked that he was "honored and humbled" by the vote of confidence from his colleagues.
