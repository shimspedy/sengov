Gerald Anthony Neal, born on September 22, 1945, is an American politician and attorney. He is a Democratic Party member of the Kentucky Senate, representing District 33 since January 1989.

Neal was born in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. He graduated from Shawnee High School in Louisville in 1963 and Kentucky State University in 1967 with a B.A. in History and Political Science. He was later bestowed an Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters. Neal received a J.D. in 1972 from the Brandeis School of Law, University of Louisville, and was later named the 2006 Distinguished Alumni Law Fellow. Neal pursued graduate studies in Political Science at the University of Michigan, and later returned to Kentucky to begin his legal career.

Neal and his wife Kathy have two children, Brandon and Kristin. Neal was appointed Senior Fellow of Public Policy and Adjunct Professor in the College of Arts & Sciences, at the University of Louisville, where he taught/teaches courses in History, State and Local Government, Health and Welfare Policy, Civil Rights & the Law (including voter, housing, employment, education, and criminal justice).

Neal is a practicing attorney with the law firm, Gerald A. Neal & Associates, LLC., in Louisville (KY). Neal is the founder of the Kentucky African American All Children's Caucus which was dedicated to addressing issues of educational diversity, and the promotion of high educational standards facilitated by appropriate methodologies. He also is the founder of The African American Community Agenda Initiative (AAI) which focus on policy research, development, and community education. AAI brings together top policy makers and implementers for the purpose of engagement, analysis, and policy scrutiny leading to change.

Neal was elected to represent District 33 (in Jefferson County), being the second African American to serve, and first African American man elected to the Kentucky State Senate. Senator Neal was first elected in 1989 and has since been re-elected consecutively over the years. This represents the longest service of any African American member of the Kentucky General Assembly.
