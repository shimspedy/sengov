Michael Lee Meredith was born on April 25, 1985, in Warren County. He grew up on a small beef cattle farm in Edmonson County. From a young age, Michael showed a keen interest in business and management. By the age of 16, he was already working part-time at the Bank of Edmonson County.

He pursued his passion for business at Western Kentucky University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Management. After graduation, he continued to work at the Bank of Edmonson County, this time as a loan officer.

In 2008, Michael took his first step into public service when he was elected to serve a two-year term on the Brownsville City Council. This experience sparked his interest in local government issues and public service.

In 2010, Michael was elected to the Kentucky General Assembly to represent the 19th District. He has continued to represent the 19th District, which now includes Edmonson County and a portion of Warren County. His tenure in the General Assembly has been marked by his commonsense, conservative approach to government. He believes in promoting the primacy of each Kentuckian and opposes large, intrusive government.

Michael is a strong advocate for agriculture and works diligently for our first responders and volunteer fire departments. His background in small business gives him a unique perspective on the job-killing regulations and taxes that plague our small business community.

Michael and his wife, Jamie, live on Jamie’s family farm in Oakland with their two daughters, Emorie and Darby. Living on a fifth-generation row crop farm, they see first-hand that farming isn’t just an occupation; it is a way of life. They hope to instill a love for the land and an appreciation for our farming community in their two young daughters.

Michael remains active in the community as a member of the Edmonson County Lions Club, Edmonson County Community Education Advisory Committee, and Edmonson County Leadership Alumni. He has also served as a member of the Edmonson County Tourism Commission, the Edmonson County High School Youth Service Center Advisory Board, and the LifeSkills Inc. Board of Directors.
