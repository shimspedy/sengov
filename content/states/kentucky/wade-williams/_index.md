D. Wade Williams is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives since January 2023. He represents Kentucky's 4th House district.

Before his political career, Williams served in the United States Army Reserve for 11 years and was in active service for four years. He is a Baptist. Williams is also a former police chief in Madisonville, Kentucky.

In terms of education, Williams earned a Bachelor of Science in organizational management from Oakland City University in 2001 and a Master of Public Administration from Murray State University.

The electoral history of Williams is quite interesting. The incumbent representative Lynn Bechler was redistricted into the 12th district, leaving the 4th district open. Williams was elected on November 8, 2022, in the 2022 Kentucky House of Representatives election against Democratic opponent Byron Hobgood.

Williams' career experience includes working as the executive director of Baptist Health System Kentucky and Indiana, the program manager of Groves Electrical Services, and the chief of police of Madisonville, Kentucky.

As of now, Williams is running for re-election to the Kentucky House of Representatives to represent District 4. The Republican primary for this office on May 21, 2024, was canceled. The general election for Kentucky House of Representatives District 4 will be held on November 5, 2024.
