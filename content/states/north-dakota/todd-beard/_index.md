Todd Beard is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He is currently serving as a senator in the North Dakota State Senate, representing the 23rd district. His tenure began on December 1, 2022.

Born and raised in North Dakota, Beard grew up on a cattle farm in Moffit, southeast of Bismarck. He graduated from Hazelton High School and has been married to his wife Debra for over 38 years. Together, they have two daughters and several grandchildren.

In 1991, Beard moved to Williston and started his career in the oilfield doing wireline jobs. He has been working in oilfield safety for 21 years, which has given him a unique perspective on the industry and its impact on the state.

In addition to his work in the oilfield, Beard is also involved in several community organizations. He is a member of the Knights of Columbus, Moose Club, and Basin Kruzers. He is also a Safety Trainer and a Senate Portfolio Leader for Williston State College and Grand Sky in Grand Forks, North Dakota.

Beard ran for election to the North Dakota State Senate to represent District 23 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. During his time in the Senate, he has sponsored several bills and served on the Interim Education Committee and Government Finance Committee.

His dedication to his community, his extensive experience in the oilfield, and his commitment to public service make him a respected figure in North Dakota politics.
