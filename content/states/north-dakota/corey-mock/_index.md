Corey Ray Mock, born on February 17, 1985, is a Democratic-NPL member of the North Dakota House of Representatives. He has served in the legislature since 2008, representing both District 42, which is in northern Grand Forks and includes the University of North Dakota, and District 17, which covers downtown Grand Forks.

Mock was born and raised in Minot, North Dakota, where he graduated from Minot High School in 2003. He attended the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, where he graduated with a degree in history with an emphasis in geography, and is pursuing postgraduate work in community and urban development. From 2001 to 2008, Mock was a Northstar Hobby Stock and IMCA Stock Car racer, and he won the Governor's Cup in 2003.

In his professional life, Mock is a Realtor, Business Owner, and Business and Leadership Consultant. He has also worked as the executive director of the Third Street Clinic, a nonprofit free clinic that provides access to health care services for low-income residents of Grand Forks and Polk counties. He is a founding partner of Cadre Consulting Group.

In the legislature, Mock has served on the education and political subdivision committees of the legislative assembly. He became known in the 2009 legislative session for his fight to create an independent redistricting commission. He worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reduce transportation costs for state travel, freeze tuition increases for North Dakota college students, and implement tax cuts. Mock was also a leading voice in the fight to end discrimination in housing, employment and financial assistance based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and in changing the law to allow fire stations to be permitted safe havens for abandoned infants.

In addition to his work as a state legislator, Mock is a member of North Dakota Farmers Union, Rotary International, GF/EGF Chamber of Commerce, Young Professionals, Sons of Norway, and is a volunteer at the Circle of Friends Humane Society. Mock also serves on the Board of Directors of North Dakota Leadership Seminar, and has been a staff member of American Legion Boys State since 2003.

Currently, Mock is a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives, representing District 18. He assumed office in 2016. His current term ends on December 1, 2024.
