Keith Boehm is a distinguished member of the North Dakota Senate, representing the 33rd district. He assumed office on December 1, 2022. Born in Bismarck, North Dakota, Boehm is a member of the Republican Party.

Before his political career, Boehm was a lifelong farmer and rancher west of Mandan. He is also a small businessman and co-owner of the Flying J Travel Center, where he serves as the Financial Manager. His career also includes over 42 years with Minnkota Power at Center, where he held both blue-collar and management positions.

Boehm is married to Janelle and they are blessed with eight children and fifteen grandchildren. They reside in Mandan, North Dakota.

In the Senate, Boehm has been a strong advocate for carbon sequestration and has led the Project Tundra. He has also sponsored several bills during his tenure.

In April 2023, Boehm argued in support of House Bill 1254, which looked to ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors and impose felony charges on doctors who perform sex assignment surgeries. He referred to gender-affirming care as "child mutilation" and falsely claimed that puberty blockers permanently sterilize children.

Despite the controversies, Boehm continues to serve his constituents and strives to make a difference in the North Dakota Senate.
