Jeremy Olson is a native of Western North Dakota, specifically McKenzie County, where his family has farmed for several generations. This upbringing in an agricultural community instilled in him the values of hard work, personal integrity, and an awareness of our natural resources.

His career in the energy industry has provided him with a deep understanding of how this sector collaborates with its community for mutual benefit. He has over 15 years of experience in the energy industry and holds a professional designation as a Certified Safety Professional (CSP) and Six Sigma Black Belt.

Olson's commitment to service and excellence has been a part of his character throughout his life. His journey of community service began in his youth, starting as a Cub Scout and continuing all the way through to becoming an Eagle Scout. His service to the nation began early too, enlisting in the National Guard at age 17 while still in high school.

He graduated from the US Military Academy at West Point, earning degrees in Engineering and Geography. He then served our nation as an Army Officer until being medically discharged as a Captain. He also holds a Masters of Business Administration from the University of Mary.

After returning to Western North Dakota in 2011, Olson immediately stepped into service and leadership roles in the community, county, and in his industry. He is currently a Township Officer and the former Chairman of the County Planning and Zoning committee, which has given him a working knowledge of local government.

As a safety professional in the energy industry, Olson is a leader amongst his peers in safety, leading initiatives, and sharing best practices in the industry. He is currently on the Board of Directors for the North Dakota Safety Council and serves on the boards of two North Dakota Veterans associations.

Olson's motivation for the role of State Representative is to continue to serve District 26 as he has done in many roles throughout his life. He may have taken off his Army uniform, but he didn't stop serving. He has been in the ND House of Representatives since his election in 2022.

He has received endorsements from several organizations, including the North Dakota Family Alliance, North Dakota Farm Bureau, National Rifle Association, North Dakota Right to Life, North Dakota Republican Party, North Dakota District 26 Republicans, and North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters. He is rated 'Conservative' by iVoterGuide.

In terms of his district, District 26, he aims to ensure that Western counties receive their fair share of the oil tax revenue that is produced there, that natural resources and land are protected for future generations, and that agriculture is preserved as the base of the local economy and protected.
