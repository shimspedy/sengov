Jose Castaneda is a Republican member of the North Dakota State Senate, representing District 40. He assumed office on December 1, 2024, and his current term will end on December 1, 2028.​

Born in Mexico City, Mexico, Jose's family legally immigrated to the United States in 1985. In 1992, he proudly became an American citizen. Raised in Tucson, Arizona, Jose's upbringing was influenced by his mother, a retired teacher, and his father, an electrical engineer, who instilled in him the values of education and hard work.​

Jose's academic journey led him to the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he graduated as a Second Lieutenant in 2000 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. He furthered his education by earning a Master of Science in Aeronautics from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.​

Over the next two decades, Jose dedicated himself to military service, serving as both an instructor pilot and a B-52 pilot. His assignments took him across the nation, but it was at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota where he found a profound sense of community and purpose. Stationed there from 2008 to 2013, and again from 2016 until his retirement in 2020, Jose developed deep ties to the Minot area. After a tenure at the Pentagon, he chose to return to Minot to complete his military career. Reflecting on this decision, Jose remarked, "I feel fortunate to have spent half of my military career at Minot Air Force Base in the great state of North Dakota. Like many veterans that have 'come north' to Minot Air Force Base, I decided to make Minot my home after retirement. I love this state and the people of Minot."​

Following his retirement from the Air Force, Jose continued his commitment to service by becoming a medevac pilot, operating flights in and out of Minot International Airport. This role allowed him to utilize his extensive aviation experience to provide critical support to those in need within his community.​

Jose's dedication to his community and country inspired him to enter the political arena. As an at-large member of the District 40 Republican Party, he aimed to uphold the principles of individual liberty, personal responsibility, and limited government. In 2024, he announced his candidacy for the North Dakota State Senate, seeking to represent District 40. His campaign emphasized protecting individual liberties, inspiring personal responsibility, and ensuring limited government intervention. Jose stated, "As an immigrant, I know firsthand that the opportunities that this country has to offer are second to none. But to turn opportunity into real success requires a tremendous amount of hard work and dedication. My goal is to truly represent every member of District 40, ensuring that the legislation that leaves Bismarck adds true and real opportunity for every person and family."​

Jose's election to the State Senate was marked by overwhelming support from his constituents, reflecting their trust in his leadership and vision. As a senator, he serves on key committees, including the State and Local Government Committee as Vice Chair and the Judiciary Committee. These assignments allow him to contribute significantly to shaping policies that impact both his district and the state at large.​

Beyond his professional and political endeavors, Jose is deeply committed to his family and faith. He and his wife, Feliciana, have eight children, ranging in age from 15 to 23. The Castaneda family is actively involved in their local community and are members of St. Leo the Great Catholic Church. Jose is also a member of the Knights of Columbus, further demonstrating his dedication to service and community engagement.

Senator Jose Castaneda's journey from immigrant to military officer to state legislator embodies the American Dream. His life story is a testament to the values of hard work, dedication, and service to others. As he continues his tenure in the North Dakota State Senate, Jose remains committed to representing the interests of his constituents in District 40 and working towards policies that promote liberty, responsibility, and opportunity for all North Dakotans.
