Collette Brown is a Democratic member of the North Dakota House of Representatives, representing District 9. She assumed office on December 1, 2024, and her current term will end on December 1, 2028.​

Born and raised in North Dakota, Collette is an enrolled member of the Spirit Lake Tribe. Her upbringing on the reservation instilled in her a deep appreciation for her heritage and a commitment to serving her community. She pursued higher education at Cankdeska Cikana Community College, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration in 2006. Continuing her academic journey, she obtained a Bachelor's degree in Finance from Mayville State University in 2009. These academic achievements provided her with a solid foundation in financial management and organizational leadership.​

Collette's professional career is marked by a dedication to public service and community development. Since 2016, she has served as the Executive Director of the Gaming Commission at Spirit Lake Casino & Resort. In this role, she oversees regulatory compliance and ensures the integrity of gaming operations, contributing significantly to the economic vitality of the Spirit Lake community. Prior to this position, Collette worked as a Business Manager at Warwick Public School from 2014 to 2015, where she managed financial operations and administrative functions, demonstrating her commitment to educational institutions. Earlier in her career, from 1999 to 2001, she served as a Wildland Firefighter with Spirit Lake Range Fire Management, showcasing her dedication to environmental stewardship and public safety.​

In addition to her professional endeavors, Collette has been actively involved in various organizations that promote community welfare and cultural preservation. She is a member of the Board of Regents at Cankdeska Cikana Community College, where she contributes to the advancement of higher education opportunities for Native American students. Furthermore, she represents the Great Plains region in the Indian Gaming Association and the National Tribal Gaming Commissioners & Regulators, advocating for policies that support tribal sovereignty and economic development. Her involvement with the Spirit Lake Tribe's North Dakota Native Tourism Alliance underscores her commitment to promoting cultural tourism and preserving indigenous heritage.​

Collette's decision to enter politics was driven by a desire to address critical issues affecting her constituents, particularly those within the Native American community. She has been a staunch advocate for voting rights, playing a pivotal role in two successful cases that challenged barriers to Native American enfranchisement. One notable case led to an agreement with Benson County to establish satellite voting offices on the Spirit Lake Reservation, thereby improving access to the ballot for tribal members. Another significant victory was achieved at the state level, resulting in the elimination of North Dakota's voter ID law that disproportionately affected Native voters. These accomplishments highlight her unwavering commitment to ensuring equitable access to the democratic process.​

As a state representative, Collette serves on several key committees, including Government and Veterans Affairs, Industry, Business and Labor, and Correction and Revision of the Journal. These assignments enable her to influence legislation on a broad spectrum of issues, from veterans' services and governmental operations to business regulations and labor relations. Her legislative priorities reflect her dedication to promoting economic development, enhancing educational opportunities, and safeguarding the rights of all North Dakotans.​

Residing in Warwick, North Dakota, Collette balances her professional and political responsibilities with her role as a mother to three children. Her life experiences as a parent, professional, and community leader inform her empathetic approach to policymaking, ensuring that the voices of diverse constituencies are heard and represented. Through her multifaceted career and public service, Collette Brown exemplifies a steadfast commitment to the betterment of her community and the state of North Dakota.
