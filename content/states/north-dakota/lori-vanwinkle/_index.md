Lori VanWinkle, whose maiden name is Miska, is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives from the 3rd district. She shares this responsibility with Jeff Hoverson. She is a member of the Republican Party.

VanWinkle was born and raised in Hastings, Minnesota, where she graduated from Hastings High School. She later pursued higher education, earning an Associate of Arts (A.A.) degree from Inver Hills Community College. She also holds a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in Cultured Studies and Biblical Studies from North Central University.

Before entering politics, VanWinkle had a successful career in real estate. She worked as a realtor with Hometown Realty and was recognized as the Rookie Realtor of the Year in 2021. In addition to her real estate career, she co-owns the VanWinkle Painting Company.

VanWinkle's decision to enter politics was driven by her response to government mandates related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which she characterized as an infringement of personal freedom. She campaigned on the importance of "bringing our roots back to a Biblical worldview" and was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2022.

In March 2023, she made headlines when she compared students using their preferred pronouns to committing murder.

Outside of her political and professional life, VanWinkle is recognized as a leader in her community. She has been involved in civic engagement and is active in her church. Her leadership abilities led her to coach youth sports for many years, as well as college-level soccer.

VanWinkle is married to Christ VanWinkle and they have four children: Lexi, Luke, Laney, and Liam. She has been a long-time supporter of the International Justice Mission since 2000 and Compassion International since 2001.
