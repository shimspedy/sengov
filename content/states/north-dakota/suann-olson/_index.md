SuAnn Olson is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. She has been serving as a representative in the North Dakota House of Representatives from District 8 since December 1, 2022.

Before her political career, SuAnn was a Certified Public Accountant and recently retired as a tax partner with Eide Bailly LLP. She has significant experience with the oil and gas industry, agriculture, and small business. SuAnn consulted with all types of businesses and has particular strength as a business advisor.

In addition to her own business and tax knowledge, SuAnn has had a front row seat to North Dakota's coal mining opportunities and challenges. Her husband's 29-year career as a mine supervisor, along with her professional work with clients in the mining and oil and gas industries, proves to be a very valuable asset for SuAnn.

SuAnn has been on the board of the Miss North Dakota Scholarship Organization for more than 10 years. Additionally, she is active in her church as the treasurer and in the Wilton Lions club. She also served on the local school board for 14 years and was a 4-H leader for many years.

SuAnn was raised on a dairy farm, as part of a large family where conservative values of responsibility, hard work and being self-sufficient were demonstrated daily. Today, she and her husband Randy continue to live those rural values, raising Angus cattle, as well as, riding and driving their team of horses. She is a wife, mother and proud grandmother to 10 beautiful children.

She is currently running for re-election to the North Dakota House of Representatives to represent District 8. Her current term ends on December 1, 2024.
