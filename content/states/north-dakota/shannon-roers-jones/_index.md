Shannon Roers Jones is an American attorney and politician who has been serving in the North Dakota House of Representatives from the 46th district since December 1, 2016. She was the North Dakota House Republican Caucus Chairperson from 2019 to 2021.

Born in Fargo, North Dakota, Roers Jones spent most of her early life in Horace. Her father, Jim Roers, is the CEO of Roers Construction, a company he formed in 1976. Roers Jones pursued her higher education in business, earning a Bachelor of Arts from the College of St. Benedict in 1999 and an MBA from the University of St. Thomas in 2001. She furthered her education by earning a Juris Doctor from the University of North Dakota School of Law in 2011.

Roers Jones began her career working for multiple construction firms and in the real estate industry. After law school, she started working as a real estate attorney and also served as the main attorney in her father's business.

In 2016, Roers Jones first ran for office for the house seat for district 46 as the Republican successor to retiring incumbent Kathy Hawken. She won with 28.64% of the vote. In the 2020 General Election for North Dakota House of Representatives District 46, she secured 27.77% of the votes.

Roers Jones has been a leading voice on several key issues. In 2017, she spearheaded the push to repeal the last remnants of North Dakota's Blue laws. Although the 2017 bill failed, she sponsored the bill again in 2019 which would make it legal for stores to be open on Sundays before noon. In 2019, her bill passed both the House and the Senate and was signed onto law by Governor Doug Burgum, and went into effect on August 1, 2019.

While Roers Jones opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana, she sponsored a bill in 2019 calling for the decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana (less than one ounce or less than 6 ounces).

Roers Jones resides in south Fargo with her three children, Olivia, Kendall, and Kate.
