Karen A. Anderson is an American politician serving as a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives. She represents the 19th district, which includes all of Pembina County, most of Walsh County, and the eastern edge of Cavalier County.

Karen is a lifelong resident of Walsh County. She and her first husband, Vance, raised their children on the family farm west of Grafton, where they farmed, raising potatoes, sugar beets, and wheat. After Vance passed away in 2017, Karen remarried in 2020 and now lives with her husband Ron in rural Grafton.

Before her political career, Karen was a Walsh County Commissioner and is currently Vice President of the North Dakota County Commissioners Association. She is associated with several organizations including Concerned Women for America of ND, Walsh County Veterans Memorial Foundation, Walsh County Farm Bureau, and the board of the Pregnancy Help Center. She also serves on the Northern Valley Human Service board, Tri-County Domestic Violence board, Law Enforcement Center board, and the North Dakota County Commissioners Association.

As a volunteer, Karen is a board member of the Walsh County Veterans Memorial Foundation and Walsh County Farm Bureau. She is also a board member of the Pregnancy Help Center, the Walsh County Food Pantry, and Concerned Women for America of North Dakota. Karen is also a member of the American Legion Auxiliary and the Grafton Assembly of God Church.

In the North Dakota legislature, Karen serves on the Human Services committee and the Transportation Committee. She won the seat in the 2022 election with fellow Republican David Monson against Democratic candidates Jill Hipsher and Lynnell Popowski.

Karen believes in conservative North Dakota values and is actively involved with the District 19 Republican Party. She supports the North Dakota Republican platform, which includes individual liberty and right to life, personal responsibility, limited government, peace through strength and the rule of law, lower taxes, right to bear arms, family integrity, and quality education.
