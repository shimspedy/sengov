Jim Grueneich is an American politician who served as a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives. He represented the 12th district from 2016 to 2020 and currently represents the 28th district since 2023.

Born as James Grueneich, he attended the Alexandria Technical and Community College. After his education, he served in the United States Air Force, contributing to his country in a significant way.

In 2016, Grueneich was elected to the North Dakota House of Representatives, marking the beginning of his political career. However, he resigned from the House in February 2020 after moving outside his district. He was succeeded by Mitch Ostlie.

Despite this setback, Grueneich's political journey did not end there. He ran for election again in 2022, this time to represent District 28. He won in the general election held on November 8, 2022, and assumed office on December 1, 2022. His current term ends on December 1, 2024.

Apart from his political career, Grueneich is also known for his personal life. He is married and has three children. He is a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and the Shriners.

Grueneich's journey from a student to a veteran of the United States Air Force, and then to a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives, is truly inspiring. His dedication to serving his country and his constituents is commendable.
