Hamida Dakane is a Kenyan-American politician who has made significant strides in the political landscape of North Dakota. She is the first Black and first Muslim person to serve in the North Dakota Legislative Assembly. Born in northeastern Kenya around 1989 and of Somali descent, Dakane moved to the United States in 2011 on a student visa to attend North Dakota State University.

While studying for her bachelor's degree in emergency management and international studies, she chaired the NDSU Black Student Association. After graduation, she stayed in the United States to work as a community organizer. Her first run for political office was in 2020, where she sought to represent District 16 in the North Dakota House of Representatives, but was unsuccessful.

In November 2022, Dakane was elected to represent House District 10 for a two-year term from December 1, 2022, to December 1, 2024. She represents the district alongside Rep. Steve Swiontek, a Republican. During North Dakota's 2023 legislative session, Dakane served on the Industry, Business and Labor and the Transportation standing committees and held interim appointments on the Workforce and the Agricultural and Natural Resources standing committees.

Dakane and fellow state senator Kathy Hogan have sponsored mental health, childcare, and workforce development bills, most of which have been voted down by the overwhelmingly Republican state legislature. Dakane holds a Master of Public Administration from the University of Maryland. In 2018, she was appointed to serve on the Fargo Human Relations Commission. She has received the Human Rights MLK Award from the City of Fargo and been named Woman of the Year by the Fargo YWCA.

Before her political victory, she was a community organizer, inspired to embrace her dream of offering social support to others. Dakane's career experience includes working as a new American community organizer with the North Dakota Democratic-NPL, a community organizer with AmeriCorps VISTA, and a workforce development case manager. She earned an M.P.A. from the University of Mary in 2019.
