This academic foundation launched a successful career in engineering.​

Mike's professional journey began with leadership roles in the private sector, overseeing teams in Minneapolis and St. Louis.

His civic engagement includes participation in the Bismarck-Mandan Chamber of Commerce and serving on the Church Council at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church. Additionally, Mike has volunteered with youth sports programs, reflecting his dedication to fostering community development.​

His campaign emphasized the importance of making North Dakota the best place to live and raise a family. As a state representative, Mike serves on the Appropriations Committee and its Human Resources Division, where he plays a crucial role in shaping the state's budget and financial policies.​

Residing in rural Burleigh County, Mike and Wendy are parents to two children, Eleanor and Charlie.
