Kent Weston is a Republican member of the North Dakota State Senate, representing District 15. He assumed office on December 1, 2024, and his current term will end on December 1, 2028. 

Kent Weston was born and raised in Sarles, North Dakota. There, he attended elementary school and later high school at Border Central in Calvin. Kent attended NDSU, receiving a degree in Agricultural Engineering. He worked for 3 years in Grand Forks at Nodak Rural Electric. Kent’s heart was always set on coming back to the farm. That’s exactly what he did in 1988 when he began his business, Weston Seed House and became a fourth-generation farmer.
Kent coached Junior High basketball for over 15 years, including in co-ops of Border Central, Rock Lake, Wolford, Rolla, Munich and Langdon. He has also been a Youth Leader for 15 years, leading youth on four mission trips. For 3 years, he helped organize fundraising events for youth to stock shelves and pack food hampers at the Turtle Mountain Food Pantry as well as events involving Shepheard’s Hill at the Crossroads. Kent sat on the FFA board in Munich and has supported for many years the Towner County and Rolette County 4-H programs. He has always had a heart to see young people succeed.

After considerable thought and, especially, prayer, Kent felt called to run for the Senate position and that is what he decided to do. He believes in conservative family values and he wants to lead on these values in Bismarck. It’s also important to Kent that he provide a chance for the people of the Turtle Mountains to have good representation from the Republican Party. With a supermajority Republican legislature, Kent knows that he can use his experience and leadership skills to get things done for the community.

An active member of the community, Kent has served on many different boards including the Cavalier County Economic Development Board, Calvin and Rock Lake School Boards, Cypress Township Board and his local church board. Kent has been active in Republican politics for over 20 years. He served on the District 10 Republican Executive Committee, and has been elected as a delegate to the Republican State Convention for many years.
