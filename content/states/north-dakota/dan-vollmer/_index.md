Dan Vollmer is a Republican member of the North Dakota House of Representatives, representing District 6. He assumed office on December 1, 2024, and his current term will end on December 1, 2028.​

Born in June 1954 in Willow City, North Dakota, Dan is a fifth-generation North Dakotan whose family has been part of the Willow City and Bottineau County community since 1887. He graduated from Willow City High School and pursued higher education at North Dakota State University (NDSU), earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science. Furthering his expertise in the financial sector, Dan attended the Graduate School of Banking at the University of Colorado. ​

Dan's professional career spans over four decades in the community banking industry in North Dakota. He has held various leadership roles, including serving on the Board of Directors of the North Dakota Bankers Association. His extensive experience in banking has provided him with a deep understanding of the state's economic landscape and the financial needs of its residents. ​

In addition to his banking career, Dan has been actively involved in agriculture, maintaining his family's farming operations in Willow City. His dual experience as a banker and farmer offers him a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing North Dakota's agricultural and financial sectors. ​

Dan's commitment to public service is evident through his longstanding involvement in the Republican Party. His grandfather, Art Vollmer, ran as a Republican for the House of Representatives in the 1940s and served as a precinct committeeman. Dan himself has served as a vice chairman in District 9 and has been an active participant in numerous Republican State Conventions. One of his most memorable political experiences was meeting President Ronald Reagan and supporting his nomination. ​

Beyond his professional and political endeavors, Dan has dedicated time to community service. He spent many years as a volunteer hunter education instructor, teaching young hunters the safe use of firearms. This role underscores his commitment to education and the promotion of responsible citizenship among North Dakota's youth. ​

Dan's decision to run for the North Dakota House of Representatives was driven by his desire to promote conservative, pro-growth policies that support businesses and farms, uphold individual freedoms, advocate for limited government, ensure fiscal responsibility, champion free markets, and encourage energy development within the state. He is particularly focused on supporting North Dakota's oil, gas, and coal industries, emphasizing the importance of energy independence and economic growth. Additionally, Dan advocates for empowering local governments, believing that governance closest to the people is most effective. ​

As a state representative, Dan serves on the Agriculture Committee and the Industry, Business and Labor Committee. These assignments allow him to directly influence legislation affecting North Dakota's primary industries and workforce. His combined experience in banking, agriculture, and community service positions him to effectively address the diverse needs of his constituents in District 6. ​

Dan resides in Willow City with his wife, LeAnn. Together, they have three children. His deep-rooted connection to the community, both personally and professionally, continues to inform his work and dedication as a representative of the people of North Dakota.
