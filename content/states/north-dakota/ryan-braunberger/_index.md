Ryan Braunberger is an American politician and independent contractor currently serving as a member of the North Dakota Senate for the 10th district. He assumed office on December 1, 2022, succeeding Janne Myrdal. He is a member of the Democratic-NPL Party and resides in Fargo, North Dakota, U.S.

Braunberger was born in Fargo, North Dakota. He graduated from Richland High School and later pursued higher education. He earned an associate degree in business administration from Southeastern Technical College in 2007 and a bachelor's degree in social work from Minnesota State University at Moorhead in 2022.

Before his political career, Braunberger worked as an independent contractor and as an insurance agent. He was elected to the Senate in 2022 and also serves as the Minority Caucus Leader in the senate. He has been vocal about numerous anti-LGBT bills during the 2020s anti-LGBT movement. He has expressed his frustration and concern about being a gay lawmaker in a legislature which passes as many anti-LGBT bills as it does.

In addition to his legislative duties, Braunberger served on the Judiciary Committee and State and Local Government Committee and is on the Commission on Juvenile Justice. His contributions to the state and his community extend beyond his political career, reflecting his commitment to public service.
