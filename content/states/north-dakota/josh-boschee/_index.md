Josh Boschee is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives since 2013. He represents the 44th District in the legislature, serving alongside Karla Rose Hanson in a dual-member district. He is a member of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party.

Born on May 24, 1982, in Minot, North Dakota, Boschee earned his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and his Master of Education in Educational Leadership from North Dakota State University. Before his political career, he worked as a realtor and as an assistant director of leadership and organizations for Minnesota State University, Moorhead.

In the North Dakota House of Representatives, Boschee has held significant positions. He served as the Minority Leader from December 3, 2018, to April 30, 2023. After that, he took on the role of Assistant Minority Leader.

Boschee has made history as the first openly LGBTQ+ policy-maker elected to the North Dakota legislature. His campaign faced opposition from a series of attack ads alleging that he was promoting a "gay agenda," which were revealed to have been funded by Virginia politician and anti-LGBT activist Eugene Delgaudio through his group Public Advocate of the United States.

Despite the challenges, Boschee has remained committed to his role and continues to serve his constituents in District 44, Fargo. His work in the legislature includes sponsoring various bills and participating in interim standing industry, business, and labor procedural delayed bills.

In addition to his legislative duties, Boschee also ran for the position of North Dakota’s 15th Secretary of State in 2018. Although he did not win the position, his campaign demonstrated his dedication to public service and his commitment to the people of North Dakota.
