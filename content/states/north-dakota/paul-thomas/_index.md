Born and raised in Karlsruhe, North Dakota, Paul developed a deep appreciation for agriculture and rural community life from an early age. His formative years on the family farm instilled in him a strong work ethic and a commitment to the values that define North 

In 1996, Paul earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Economics from North Dakota State University (NDSU). During his time at NDSU, he gained comprehensive knowledge of agricultural policies, market dynamics, and economic principles that would later inform his professional endeavors and public service. 

Following his graduation, Paul returned to his roots in Velva, North Dakota, where he established Thomas Grain Farms in 2004. As the owner and operator, he has been actively engaged in farming operations, navigating the challenges and opportunities inherent in modern agriculture. His firsthand experience as a farmer has provided him with a nuanced understanding of the agricultural sector's critical role in North Dakota's economy.

Paul's dedication to his community extends beyond his professional pursuits. He has served on the Velva City Commission and the Velva Sales Tax Committee, contributing to local governance and economic development initiatives. His leadership roles in organizations such as the North Dakota Corn Growers Association and the North Dakota Farm Bureau underscore his commitment to advancing the interests of farmers and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Additionally, as a member of the Drake Knights of Columbus and an active participant in St. Cecelia Catholic Church, Paul has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to his faith and civic engagement. 

In 2020, Paul's dedication to public service led him to seek elected office. He was elected to the North Dakota House of Representatives for District 6, where he served from December 1, 2020, to December 1, 2024. During his tenure in the House, Paul was appointed to the Agriculture Committee, eventually serving as its chairman, and the Industry, Business and Labor Committee. His legislative focus encompassed a range of issues, including agricultural policy, economic development, and business regulation.

Paul's effective leadership and dedication to his constituents paved the way for his election to the North Dakota State Senate in 2024. As a senator, he continues to advocate for policies that support the agricultural community, enhance economic opportunities, and uphold the values cherished by the residents of District 6. His legislative priorities reflect his deep understanding of the challenges facing rural communities and his unwavering commitment to addressing them.

Beyond his legislative duties, Paul remains deeply connected to his community. He and his wife, Karen, reside in Velva, where they have raised their two children. The Thomas family continues to be actively involved in local events and organizations, embodying the spirit of service and community engagement that has defined Paul's life and career.
