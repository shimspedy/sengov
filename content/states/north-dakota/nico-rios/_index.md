Nico Rios is an American politician affiliated with the Republican Party. He has been serving as a representative for the 23rd district in the North Dakota House of Representatives since 2022, alongside Scott Dyk. 

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Rios moved to North Dakota and began his political career. Prior to this, he worked in Senator Ted Cruz's Washington, D.C., office. As of 2022, he was working as a wireline operator in Williston, North Dakota. 

Rios' political journey was motivated by his desire to combat what he saw as medical and economic tyranny across the country due to COVID-19. This led him to run for office in 2022.

However, his career has not been without controversy. On December 15, 2023, Rios was pulled over at around 11:30 p.m. after he failed to stay in his lane. In a police report, he was noted as being verbally abusive, homophobic, racially abusive, and discriminatory toward an officer. During the arrest, Rios told the officers that they would regret picking on him because they didn't know who he was. Rios was charged with driving under the influence and refusing to provide a chemical test. He later pleaded guilty to drunk driving and was sentenced to nearly one year of unsupervised probation and a $1,000 fine. In an apology statement, he said that he decided to act like a dummy and that the officers did nothing to deserve any sort of disrespect. He vowed to make sure this never happens again.

Rios represents the 23rd district in the North Dakota House of Representatives. The district is located in the western part of the state. Rios won the general election for the North Dakota House of Representatives District 23 on November 8, 2022. He ran for election to represent District 23 and won in the general election. His current term ends on December 1, 2026.
