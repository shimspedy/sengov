Born and raised in Grand Forks, North Dakota, Nels developed a strong connection to his community from an early age. He pursued higher education at the University of Southern California, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration. This academic foundation provided him with a comprehensive understanding of business operations and management principles.​

Professionally, Nels has built a career in the railroad industry. His work in this sector has equipped him with insights into transportation logistics, infrastructure development, and the economic factors influencing regional and national commerce.​

Nels's dedication to public service is evident through his involvement in various legislative committees. During the 2025 legislative session, he serves on the Judiciary and Transportation committees. These assignments allow him to contribute to shaping policies related to legal frameworks, public safety, and the state's transportation systems.​

In addition to his standing committee roles, Nels is actively engaged in several interim committees, including the Administrative Rules Committee, Budget Section, Employee Benefits Programs Committee, Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee, and Legislative Management. His participation in these committees enables him to oversee various aspects of state governance, from budgetary considerations to regulatory practices.​

Nels's legislative priorities reflect his commitment to addressing the needs of his constituents in District 18. He is focused on tax relief initiatives, particularly working to expand the homestead tax credit to benefit homeowners. Additionally, he advocates for policies that support economic growth, infrastructure improvement, and the well-being of North Dakota residents.​

Residing in Grand Forks with his wife, Kristin, and their three children, Nels balances his professional and legislative responsibilities with family life. His personal experiences as a husband and father inform his perspectives on education, community development, and family-centered policies.
