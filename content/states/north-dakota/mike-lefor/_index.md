Representative Mike Lefor is a dedicated public servant with a long history of service to his community and the state of North Dakota. He has been a steadfast figure in the North Dakota House of Representatives for nearly three decades, representing District 37.

Mike Lefor's journey in public service began at the age of 29 when he was elected to the Dickinson Park Board. Over the years, he has served the Dickinson community in various capacities, including Chairman of the Planning and Zoning Commission from 1993 to 2003, President of the Dickinson Park Board from 2006 to 2014, and Chairman of CHI St. Joseph Hospital from 2008 to 2014. He also served on the City Commission in 2016.

In the North Dakota House of Representatives, Mike Lefor is widely regarded as a leader by his peers. This is evidenced by his three-time election to the Legislative Management committee, which oversees the legislative branch during the interim period between sessions. In just his fourth session, he was named Chairman of the Industry, Business, and Labor Committee, due to his willingness to go the extra mile in researching the issues and his mentorship to other legislators.

During his tenure in the legislative assembly, Mike Lefor has been named Chair of three different committees, including Employee Benefits; Retirement; and Industry, Business, and Labor. He has been appointed by leadership to serve on the first Ethics Committee; the Committee on Rules; and the Committee on Committees, which determines committee membership for all legislators.

In the 2017 session, Mike Lefor was elected Majority Caucus Leader of the North Dakota House of Representatives, providing him insight into decision-making at the leadership level. He was also responsible for mentoring twenty-four freshman legislators at weekly meetings. He attended the Bowhay Institute for Legislative Leadership Development at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2015. Only three North Dakota legislators per session are invited to this training, and Mike Lefor now serves on the Institute's selection committee.

For four sessions, Mike Lefor has served on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which provided him with insight and education into the many industries in our state. He gives a voice to western North Dakota on important economic and energy issues, and prioritizes diversifying the economy and workforce training.

Mike Lefor believes strongly in limited government and fighting for our rights and freedom, including the right to life and Second Amendment rights. In the past two sessions, he has been awarded the Conservative Achievement Award by the American Conservative Union due to his voting record.

Outside of his political career, Mike Lefor is the President of Blackridge Enterprises, LLC and a graduate of Dickinson State University (DSU). His proudest moment, however, was his marriage to the former Sherryl Riehl on September 25, 1987, and the births of their children: Brett, Scott, and Andi. In the past two years, the Lefor family has added two in-laws, Samantha and Mat, in whom he is very proud.
