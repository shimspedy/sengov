​Jared Hendrix is a Republican member of the North Dakota House of Representatives, representing District 10. He assumed office on December 1, 2024, and his current term will end on December 1, 2028.

Born in June 1983 in Newport News, Virginia, Jared is the proud son of a Naval veteran turned career law enforcement officer and a loving homemaker. He pursued higher education at Thomas Nelson Community College, earning an Associate's degree in Computer Arts. In 2012, Jared relocated to North Dakota, drawn by the state's opportunities and the welcoming nature of its communities. ​

Professionally, Jared has a diverse background that includes roles in retail, warehousing, construction, and manual labor in the North Dakota oil fields. Since 2014, he has owned a small consulting business that provides strategic planning, marketing, and other services. This entrepreneurial endeavor has allowed him to engage with various sectors, understanding the challenges and opportunities faced by small businesses in the state.​

Jared's commitment to civic engagement is evident through his leadership in statewide initiatives. In 2022, he successfully led a ballot initiative that imposed term limits on the offices of North Dakota governor and state legislators. Despite facing opposition from both political parties and numerous special interest groups, the campaign garnered widespread support from voters across the political spectrum. In 2024, he chaired the "Retire Congress North Dakota" campaign, advocating for age limits on the state's members of Congress to ensure effective and responsive representation. ​

As a state representative, Jared serves on the Human Services and Transportation committees. These assignments allow him to influence policies related to public welfare, healthcare, infrastructure, and transit systems—areas critical to the well-being and development of North Dakota's communities.​

Jared's legislative priorities focus on reducing the cost of living by lowering taxes and eliminating excessive regulations. He advocates for improving K-12 education through proper funding and a return to foundational learning principles. Fiscal responsibility is central to his platform, emphasizing the need to cut wasteful government spending and prioritize budgets toward essential infrastructure and local services. Jared is also committed to supporting strong families, protecting the innocence of children, and ensuring that technological advancements serve the interests of the people. ​

Residing in West Fargo, Jared is engaged to Anna, an ICU nurse and Jamaican immigrant. They share their home with a Bengal cat named Liberty. In his personal life, Jared enjoys participating in community events and attending Antioch Church in Fargo, reflecting his dedication to faith and community values.
