Keith Kempenich is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He was born on July 28, 1959, in Bowman, North Dakota, United States. He has been serving as a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives from the 39th District since 1992.

In addition to his political career, Kempenich is also a rancher and a crop adjuster. He is affiliated with the Black Hills State Farm Bureau and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA). He is married to Melinda and they have three children.

Throughout his political career, Kempenich has been involved in various legislative activities. In January 2017, he proposed a bill titled HB No. 1203, which aimed to prevent a driver who unintentionally injures or kills a person intentionally obstructing a roadway from being held liable for any damages. He stated that the bill was in response to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests blocking a nearby highway. The bill, however, was defeated by a 50-41 vote on February 13.

In February 2021, Kempenich filed legislation in committee that would compensate state legislators from outside Bismarck for meals consumed while in session. According to a parliamentary estimate, it would cost taxpayers around $424,000.

As of the 68th Legislative Assembly - Regular Session in 2023, Kempenich continues to serve as a representative for the Republican District 39 in Bowman. He is a member of several committees, including the Interim Budget Section, Budget Section - Government Operations Division, Government Finance Committee, Legacy and Budget Stabilization Fund Advisory Board, and the Standing Appropriations (Vice Chair) Appropriations - Government Operations Division.

Kempenich's current term ends on December 1, 2026.
