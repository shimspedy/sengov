Mark Enget is a Republican member of the North Dakota State Senate, representing District 2. He assumed office in 2025, and his current term will end in 2029.

Born and raised on a small farm near Powers Lake, North Dakota, Mark experienced a humble upbringing. Despite limited resources, he recalls a childhood filled with love, friendship, and a strong sense of community. This foundation instilled in him the values of hard work, resilience, and gratitude.

Mark pursued higher education at Minot State University, focusing on Earth Sciences and Physical Education. Initially aspiring to become a teacher and coach, financial constraints led him to seek opportunities in the energy sector. He accepted a position in Texas, marking the beginning of a 35-year career that spanned the globe. His professional journey took him to countries such as China, Pakistan, Venezuela, Mexico, Singapore, and the Philippines, as well as various locations within the United States, including Houston, Oklahoma, and Denver. Throughout these experiences, Mark gained invaluable insights into international business operations and cross-cultural management.

During a transfer back to North Dakota, Mark met his wife, Roxanne, a native of Kenmare. Together, they navigated the challenges of a mobile lifestyle, raising three daughters amidst frequent relocations. Eventually, seeking stability and a return to their roots, Mark and Roxanne retired to a home near his childhood farm in Powers Lake.

Mark's deep understanding of North Dakota's pivotal industries—energy and agriculture—positions him as a knowledgeable advocate for his constituents. His commitment to preserving the state's values, culture, and way of life is evident in his legislative priorities. He emphasizes the importance of providing quality educational opportunities for children, fostering strong and safe communities, maintaining fiscally responsible budgets, and enacting sensible laws and fair regulations that serve all citizens.

Active in his community, Mark is involved with organizations such as Gideons International, the Lions Club, and Bethel Baptist Church. These affiliations reflect his dedication to service and his desire to contribute positively to society.

In the North Dakota State Senate, Mark serves on the Energy and Natural Resources and Industry and Business standing committees. Additionally, he is a member of the Capitol Grounds Planning Commission, a statutory committee responsible for overseeing the planning and development of the state's capitol grounds. 

Mark Enget's life story is one of dedication—to his family, his community, and the state of North Dakota. His diverse experiences and steadfast values guide his work in the Senate, where he strives to represent the interests and uphold the principles of his constituents in District 2.
