Donna Henderson is a Republican member of the North Dakota House of Representatives, representing District 15. She assumed office on December 1, 2024, and her current term will end on December 1, 2028.​

Born and raised in Munich, North Dakota, Donna has deep roots in the community. She pursued higher education at the North Dakota State College of Science (NDSCS), earning an Associate of Science degree. Her professional career includes working as a dental hygienist, a role she held for 14 years at a dental office in Rolla, North Dakota. In addition to her work in dental health, Donna has been a dedicated farm wife, managing the multifaceted responsibilities that come with agricultural life.​

Donna's commitment to education is evident in her decision to homeschool her six children. This experience has provided her with a profound understanding of the educational needs and challenges faced by families in North Dakota. Her dedication to family extends to her role as a grandmother to nine grandchildren, who inspire her continued involvement in public service.​

Her political journey began nearly three decades ago when she attended her first political meeting 28 years ago. Since then, Donna has been an active participant in the Republican Party, attending numerous state conventions and serving on the executive committee of her local district for over 12 years. Her involvement has included organizing meetings, dinners, fundraisers, and supporting candidates who align with conservative principles. Donna has also attended four national conventions to elect presidential candidates, demonstrating her commitment to the political process at both state and national levels.​

Donna's legislative interests are diverse, reflecting her commitment to various aspects of community welfare. She has been actively involved in reviewing and testifying on proposed bills, particularly those related to medical rights and personal freedoms. Her advocacy for personal responsibility and minimal government intervention is a cornerstone of her political philosophy. Donna emphasizes the importance of fiscal responsibility, advocating for the prudent use of North Dakota's substantial financial resources to benefit the citizens rather than funding special interest projects.​

In her capacity as a state representative, Donna serves on the Agriculture and Judiciary committees. These assignments allow her to influence legislation pertinent to North Dakota's agricultural heritage and legal framework. Her firsthand experience in farming and her background in dental hygiene provide her with unique insights into the issues faced by her constituents.​

Beyond her legislative duties, Donna is the secretary of the Cavalier County Farm Bureau, where she continues to advocate for the interests of farmers and rural communities. Her hobbies include gardening and engaging in political activities, reflecting her passion for both nurturing growth and fostering civic engagement.​

Donna resides in Calvin, North Dakota, with her husband, Paul, to whom she has been married for 38 years. Together, they have built a life centered around family, faith, and service to their community. Donna's multifaceted experiences as a healthcare professional, educator, agricultural partner, and political advocate equip her to represent the values and concerns of her constituents effectively.
