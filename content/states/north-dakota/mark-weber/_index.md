Mark F. Weber is an American politician, farmer, and businessman currently serving as a member of the North Dakota Senate from the 22nd district. He was elected in November 2020 and assumed office on December 1, 2020.

Born and raised in North Dakota, Weber has a deep connection with the land and the people. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanized Agriculture and a Master of Science in Agricultural Economics, both from North Dakota State University. This educational background has equipped him with a deep understanding of the agricultural industry, which is a significant part of North Dakota's economy.

Before his political career, Weber worked as a farmer and was the director of the Northern Crops Institute in Fargo, North Dakota. His work in the agricultural sector has given him firsthand experience of the challenges and opportunities in this field, making him a strong advocate for farmers and agricultural businesses in the Senate.

In addition to his work in agriculture, Weber has also served as a bank director for Choice Financial Holdings. This experience in the financial sector has provided him with valuable insights into economic and financial policies.

Weber is a member of the Republican Party, reflecting the state's conservative political leaning. Despite the often polarizing nature of politics, Weber is known for his ability to work across party lines to get things done.

He is married to Jadene and they have two children. They reside in Casselton, North Dakota. In his spare time, Weber enjoys spending time with his family and working on their family farming partnership.

As a senator, Weber has sponsored several bills and has been a vocal advocate for agricultural processing centers. He is also the Senate Portfolio Leader for Grand Farm. His work in the Senate reflects his commitment to serving the people of North Dakota and advancing the state's interests at the national level.

Weber's journey from a farmer to a state senator is a testament to his dedication, hard work, and commitment to public service. As he continues his work in the Senate, Weber remains focused on representing the interests of his constituents and making a positive impact on the lives of the people of North Dakota.
