Kimberly Remak is an esteemed member of the Mississippi House of Representatives, representing District 7. She is a proud member of the Republican Party. Her journey in the political arena began when she announced her candidacy in early 2023.

In the Republican primary that took place in August of the same year, Remak emerged victorious, defeating James Goodkind after earning 50.1 percent of the vote. This victory paved the way for her to represent the Republican Party in the general election.

In the general election, Remak faced off against Democrat Gail Baptist Lyons. Displaying her political prowess and the trust the public had placed in her, Remak defeated Lyons, marking a significant milestone in her political career.

Interestingly, this was not Remak's first foray into politics. She had previously run in the same district in 2019. During that time, she received an endorsement from Governor Phil Bryant. However, she was defeated by Steve Hopkins in the Republican primary.

Remak officially assumed office on January 2, 2024. Her current term is set to end on January 4, 2028, during which she is expected to serve her constituents with dedication and integrity.

On a personal note, Remak is a Christian and a seventh-generation resident of Mississippi. She is married to Geza Remak. Her personal life and political career are a testament to her commitment to her faith, her family, and her community.
