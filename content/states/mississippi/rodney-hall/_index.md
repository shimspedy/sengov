Rodney Hall is a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives, representing District 20. He is affiliated with the Republican Party and has been serving since January 2, 2024. His current term ends on January 4, 2028.

Hall ran for election to the Mississippi House of Representatives to represent District 20 and won in the general election on November 7, 2023. He is the first African-American Republican to serve in the Mississippi House since the Reconstruction era, making his victory a significant milestone in the state's political history.

Before his political career, Hall served in the Mississippi Army National Guard, initially as a military intelligence code linguist and as a U.S. Army paratrooper. In 2008, Hall was commissioned as an infantry officer with the U.S. Army, reaching the rank of lieutenant and eventually company commander. As of 2023, Hall served as the battalion executive officer in the Mississippi Rifles Regiment.

Hall earned a J.D. from the University of Mississippi. His career experience includes working as an attorney and as the legislative director for Congressman Trent Kelly (R-MS).

In the 2023 elections, Hall defeated Charlie Hoots in the Republican primary for Mississippi House of Representatives District 20 on August 8, 2023. He then went on to win the general election for Mississippi House of Representatives District 20 on November 7, 2023, securing 100% of the votes.

Hall's dedication to public service and his extensive experience in both the military and legal fields have made him a respected figure in Mississippi politics. His tenure in the Mississippi House of Representatives continues to be marked by his commitment to the people of District 20 and the state of Mississippi.
