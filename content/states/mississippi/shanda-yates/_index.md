She understands and values hard work and a strong work ethic.

Shanda is a product of a working middle-class family and a public school graduate, which makes her appreciate the importance of quality public education and a system that promotes and encourages the teachers who are educating the children of Mississippi. She has been instrumental in securing more than $125 million in funding for improvements to District 64â€™s infrastructure, healthcare institutions, and community resources.

Having advocated on behalf of such a wide range of clients, Shanda has a unique, balanced perspective. She can listen to and understand the concerns of a diverse constituency and bring her experience to bear in working towards finding common ground to effectively serve all Mississippians.

Shanda obtained her law degree from Mississippi College School of Law, where she graduated cum laude and served as an editor of the Law Review. Her undergraduate studies were completed at Hinds Community College and the University of Southern Mississippi. Shanda is a member of the Mississippi Bar Association, the Mississippi Association for Justice, and the Junior League of Jackson. She has also been a member of the Mississippi Defense Lawyers Association where she served as editor of the MDLA Quarterly for several years.

Shanda is a partner at Burns & Associates, PLLC where she practices with her husband and business partner, Yancy Burns. Yancy is a combat veteran who deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom with the Mississippi Army National Guard. Shanda and Yancy are the proud parents of Evan, their spirited nine-year-old son.
