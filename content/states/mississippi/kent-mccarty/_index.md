Kent McCarty is an American business owner and politician, representing the 101st District in the Mississippi House of Representatives since 2019. Born on January 24, 1993, in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, McCarty attended Oak Grove High School. He later enrolled at the University of Southern Mississippi, where he earned a bachelor's degree in finance.

During college, McCarty founded Java Moe's Coffee Company, which has now expanded to a chain of five locations across Mississippi. His entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to small businesses have been central to his political career.

In 2019, McCarty ran in a special election to replace former Representative Brad Touchstone, who resigned to take a seat on the Lamar County Court. He emerged as the top candidate in the initial special election, securing victory in the subsequent runoff with an impressive 68% of the vote. McCarty's dedication to public service led him to be sworn into office on April 5, 2019.

As a legislator, McCarty has actively championed public education and economic growth. He believes in supporting small businesses as a means to strengthen the state's economy. In 2020, he voted in favor of changing the Mississippi State Flag, demonstrating his commitment to progress and inclusivity.

For the 2021 House session, McCarty serves as Vice Chairman of the House Education Committee. Additionally, he contributes to several other House Committees, including Accountability, Efficiency, Transparency; Banking and Financial Services; Conservation and Water Resources; and Universities and Colleges.

McCarty's dedication to his constituents and his drive to make positive changes in Mississippi continue to define his political journey. His youth, energy, and focus on community development position him as a rising star in state politics.
