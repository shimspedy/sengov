Jeremy Lee Yancey, born on July 29, 1968, is an American politician hailing from Mississippi. He currently serves as a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives, representing the 74th district. Yancey's political journey has been shaped by his upbringing and education.

Lee Yancey was born in Ripley, Mississippi, to Rex Yancey, a Southern Baptist pastor, and Ellon Yancey, a retired public schoolteacher. His childhood was marked by living in various towns across the state, including Ripley, Tupelo, Pascagoula, and Quitman. In 1986, he graduated from Quitman High School, where he excelled in academics and sports, earning the title of Mr. Quitman High School and participating in six different sports.

Yancey pursued higher education at Mississippi College, where he earned a B.A. in religion in 1991. He continued his studies at the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, obtaining a Master in Divinity in Biblical Studies in 1993. Later, he completed a doctorate in leadership administration from the same institution.

Before entering politics, Yancey served as a ministerial staffer in various churches from 1987 to 2000. In 1996, he became an Associate Pastor at the First Baptist Church in Meridian. His commitment to faith and community continued when he worked as a lobbyist for the Southern Baptist Convention from 2000 to 2007. During this time, he advocated for issues such as covenant marriage, anti-abortion legislation, and stem-cell research regulations.

In 2007, Yancey embarked on his political career by running for the Mississippi State Senate District 20. He won the election and served from January 8, 2008, to January 3, 2012. During his tenure, he championed conservative values and collaborated with fellow legislators on various bills. Yancey's dedication to public service led him to join the Woodridge Capital Portfolio Management team, where he focused on business development.

In 2020, Yancey transitioned to the Mississippi House of Representatives, representing the 74th district. His current term is set to end on January 4, 2028. As a member of the Rotary Club, a Paul Harris Fellow, and an NRA supporter, Yancey continues to contribute to his community and advocate for the people of Mississippi.
