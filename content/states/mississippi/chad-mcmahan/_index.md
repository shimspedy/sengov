Chad McMahan is an American businessman and politician, serving as a Republican member of the Mississippi State Senate for the 6th district, which includes parts of Itawamba and Lee counties.

Born on January 28, 1972, in Tupelo, Mississippi, Chad McMahan is a 5th generation Mississippian. He is the son of Larry McMahan and Susan McMahan. His grandparents were Andy and Martha Anderson of Tupelo, Mississippi, and Bill and Irene McMahan of Grenada, Mississippi.

Chad McMahan was educated at the Tupelo High School in Tupelo, Mississippi, graduating in 1990. He furthered his education at Union University in Jackson, Tennessee, where he graduated in 1995.

Before his political career, McMahan worked for Great Southern Industries, a packaging company, for two decades. He also served as an alderman in Guntown, Mississippi.

In January 2016, McMahan began his tenure as a Republican member of the Mississippi State Senate, representing District 6, which includes most of Lee County and parts of Itawamba County, Mississippi.

On the personal front, McMahan is married to Nicky Clayton McMahan of Nettleton, Mississippi, and they have a son. They reside in Guntown, and he attends the North Star Baptist Church in Saltillo, Mississippi.

McMahan believes that most people, regardless of age, sex, or race, just want a fair playing field to go to work, raise their families, attend church, participate in their civic events, and be left alone. In Jackson, that’s exactly what he’s working to achieve.
