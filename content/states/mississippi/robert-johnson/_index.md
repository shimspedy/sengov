Robert Lee Johnson III is an American politician. He first served as a state senator before becoming a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from the 94th District, being first elected in 2004. He has been the Minority Leader of the State House since 2020.

Robert L. Johnson III was born on November 29, 1958, in Natchez, Mississippi. His upbringing was shaped by his father, a bricklayer and cattle rancher, and his mother, a school teacher who later retired as an assistant superintendent. Johnson's educational journey took him from North Natchez High School to Washington University in St. Louis, where he received a scholarship. After three years there, he transferred to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, earning a degree in political science and urban studies. He furthered his education by obtaining a J.D. from the same institution, interning during summers at the attorney general's office in Mississippi.

In 1986, Johnson returned to Mississippi, working for Edwin Pittman in the attorney general's office. Subsequently, he joined Mike Moore before establishing his private practice in 1989. As a member of the Mississippi Bar Association and the Mississippi Trial Lawyers Association, Johnson has actively contributed to legal matters. Additionally, he serves as the President of the Adams County Voters League.

Johnson's political journey began in 1992 when he ran for the State Senate against incumbent Pat Welch. After a hard-fought campaign, he secured victory and represented the 38th district from 1993 to 2003. Despite losing the subsequent election due to redistricting, Johnson's determination remained unwavering. When Philip West resigned from the Mississippi House of Representatives for the 94th district, Johnson stepped up. In the special election of August 2004, he emerged victorious, assuming office that year.

His leadership continued to evolve, and in 2020, Johnson was elected Minority Leader for the Mississippi House of Representatives. His bipartisan spirit and commitment to public service have made him a respected figure in the legislature. A few weeks before his election, he had announced his retirement, but pending a decision, he chose to continue serving.

Representative Robert L. Johnson III remains dedicated to his constituents, advocating for their interests and contributing to the state's legislative landscape.
