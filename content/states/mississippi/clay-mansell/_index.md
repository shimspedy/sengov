Clay Mansell, born on July 4, 1976, is a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives for the 56th District. He affiliates with the Republican Party and has held this position since 2024.

Mansell earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from Mississippi College in 1999. He has spent his entire career as an entrepreneur and small business owner. Owning several local eateries and ten local community newspapers in the state, including papers in both Hinds and Madison Counties, gives him the unique perspective to understand the needs of District 56.

He is not a politician by profession. In fact, until encouraged to run for this office by Philip Gunn, holding political office had never been on his radar. For twenty-five years, he has been a serial entrepreneur and owner of multiple successful businesses. This experience has taught him the absolute importance of conservative fiscal management, as well as given him the skill set to get along with a wide array of people and get things accomplished.

In addition to responsible management of taxpayer dollars, Mansell also prioritizes job creation and economic development, education, public safety, and infrastructure. The children in Mississippi's foster care system are also especially near and dear to his heart. His family has fostered eleven foster children over the last four years and adopted one child. Each life has value, and he believes that we must protect all of our children and ensure they are given every opportunity to succeed in life.

Mansell serves as Chair of the Board of Trustees for Merit Health Central Hospital, Vice President for the Clinton Chamber of Commerce, immediate Past President of the Mississippi College Alumni Association and Treasurer for Main Street Clinton. He sits on the boards for the Hinds Community College Foundation, the Clinton Christian Community Corporation, and the Mississippi Brilla Soccer Ministries.
