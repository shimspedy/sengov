Omeria McDonald Scott was born on November 21, 1956, in Laurel, Mississippi, U.S. She is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She represents the 80th district in the Mississippi House of Representatives. Scott first assumed office in 1993 and has been serving her constituents since then.

In her early days, she was an award-winning cheerleader for R.H. Watkins High School in Laurel, Mississippi, during the initial days of integration. This experience likely shaped her resilience and leadership skills, which she would later bring to her political career.

Scott's professional experience includes working as a Nursing Home Administrator. This background in healthcare has undoubtedly influenced her legislative priorities and advocacy work.

Over the years, Scott has served on several committees in the Mississippi House of Representatives. These include the House Insurance Committee, Interstate Cooperation Committee, House Medicaid Committee, Public Health and Human Services Committee, House Tourism Committee, and Ways and Means Committee. Her assignments to these committees reflect her commitment to addressing a wide range of issues that affect her constituents.

In addition to her role in the Mississippi House of Representatives, Scott has also sought to represent her state at the national level. She was a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from Mississippi but lost the primary election on June 5, 2018. Despite this setback, Scott continues to serve her constituents at the state level with dedication and integrity.

Scott's tenure in the Mississippi House of Representatives has been marked by her commitment to her constituents and her dedication to public service. Her work in the legislature and her efforts to represent Mississippians at both the state and national levels underscore her commitment to improving the lives of the people she serves.
