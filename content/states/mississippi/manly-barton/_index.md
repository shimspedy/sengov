Manly George Barton was born on March 14, 1949, in Mobile, Alabama. He is an American politician and a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from the 109th District. Barton was first elected to this position in 2011 and has been serving diligently ever since. His commitment to public service extends beyond his legislative role.

Early Life:
Manly Barton graduated from Vancleave High School and Alabama Christian College. His educational background laid the foundation for his future endeavors in both politics and community service. However, it was his military service that truly shaped his character.

Military Service:
During the Vietnam War, Barton was drafted into the U.S. Army. He served with distinction in the 227th Assault Helicopter Battalion, 1st Air Cavalry Division. His bravery earned him several prestigious awards, including the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for Valor. Barton's sacrifice and dedication to his country left an indelible mark on his life.

Career and Politics:
Before entering the Mississippi Legislature, Barton served as a Jackson County Supervisor for 12 years. His experience in local government provided valuable insights into community needs and challenges. As a supervisor, he testified before the House of Representatives about the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on South Mississippiâ€”an issue close to his heart.

In 2011, Barton decided to run for the 109th district in the Mississippi House of Representatives. His campaign focused on critical areas such as economic development, education, rural issues, and infrastructure funding. The competitive primary led to his election, and he assumed office in 2012 after an uncontested general election.

Throughout his tenure, Barton has been a dedicated advocate for his constituents. He secured re-election victories, demonstrating his commitment to their well-being. In 2020, he voted in favor of changing the Mississippi state flag, reflecting his willingness to address important social issues.

Speaker Pro Tempore:
In 2024, Barton achieved a significant milestone by being elected Speaker pro tempore of the Mississippi House of Representatives. His leadership skills and legislative expertise positioned him for this crucial role. As Speaker pro tempore, he collaborates closely with Speaker Jason White to ensure efficient proceedings and effective governance.

Personal Life:
Barton's personal life is equally noteworthy. He is married to Sarah Thornton and follows the Methodist faith. Unfortunately, he contracted COVID-19 in 2020 and was admitted to the intensive care unit. Additionally, Barton faced personal tragedy when his son, an Ocean Springs teacher, passed away in 2023.

Beyond politics, Barton is actively involved in various organizations, including the Military Order Purple Heart, American Legion, VFW, National Rifle Association of America, and East Central Civic Organization. His commitment to community and country remains unwavering.

Manly George Barton's legacy extends far beyond legislative chambers. His service, sacrifice, and dedication exemplify the best of public service, leaving an indelible mark on Mississippi's political landscape.
