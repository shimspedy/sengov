Wiggins was educated at the Pascagoula High School and graduated in 1989. He graduated from Tulane University in 1993.

Career:
Wiggins is an attorney with Taggart, Rimes & Wiggins, PLLC, in Pascagoula; where he handles general litigation, family law, corporate law, trucking litigation, and municipal court matters.

He served as Assistant District Attorney and Youth Court Prosecutor in Jackson County, Mississippi for seven years prior to becoming a state senator in 2011.

Wiggins has served as a Republican member of the Mississippi State Senate since 2012, representing District 52, encompassing southern Jackson County and includes Pascagoula, Gautier, and Ocean Springs. As early as January 2012, he proposed a bill to prevent criminals convicted of manslaughter from being released early. After completing his first term, Wiggins ran unopposed in 2015. Tate Reeves named him Chairman of the first ever Senate Medicaid Committee, overseeing policy for one of the state’s largest budget items.

In his time in the Senate, Wiggins has authored and passed legislation strengthening Mississippi’s child abuse laws, including the “Lonnie Smith Act” which strengthened Mississippi’s child abuse laws, “Katie’s Law” allowing for the collection of DNA after arrest on violent felonies, increasing GPS monitoring of sex offenders, and increasing funding for prosecution of child abuse cases and handling the 2013 Criminal Justice Reform Act which strengthened laws against violent offenders, led to criminal justice reform throughout the state and is projected to save Mississippi taxpayers $210 million in correction costs.
