Mark Tullos is an American lawyer and politician from the state of Mississippi. He is a member of the Republican Party and represents the 79th district in the Mississippi House of Representatives. Tullos hails from Raleigh, Mississippi, where he also maintains his law practice.

In the November 2015 election for the Mississippi House seat in the 79th district, Tullos faced off against Blaine Eaton, a Democrat and the incumbent representative. The election ended in a tie, with both candidates receiving 4,589 votes. This required a tiebreaker, and the two candidates drew straws to determine the winner. Although Eaton drew the winning straw, Tullos appealed the result to the Republican-controlled House.

A five-member committee then invalidated five votes from Eaton's initial vote tally that were cast via affidavit, and voted 4–1 to seat Tullos instead of Eaton. The full House then voted to seat Tullos instead, giving Republicans a three-fifths supermajority of the Mississippi House of Representatives.

This event marked a significant moment in Tullos's political career and in the history of the Mississippi House of Representatives. Despite the controversy surrounding the election, Tullos has continued to serve in his role, contributing to the legislative process and representing the interests of his constituents in the 79th district.
