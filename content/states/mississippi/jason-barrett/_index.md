Jason Todd Barrett, born on March 19, 1978, is an American politician who has been serving in the Mississippi State Senate from the 39th district since 2020.

Born in Thomasville, Georgia, Barrett attended Thomas County Central High School. He graduated from the University of Georgia in 2000 and received his J.D. degree from Mississippi College School of Law in 2007. Shortly after, in October 2007, he was admitted to the Mississippi State Bar.

Before becoming an attorney, Barrett served as a teacher and coach. He now runs his own practice, Barrett Law Firm, located in Brookhaven, Mississippi, where he resides.

When former State Senator Sally Doty resigned due to an appointment by Governor Tate Reeves, Barrett ran for special election to the seat against main contender Bill Sones Sr., along with seven other minor candidates. The two went to a runoff, after Barrett secured 20.1% of the vote and Sones received 31.5% of the vote. In the general election, Barrett won with approximately 57% of the vote. Barrett assumed office on October 28, 2020 and is a Republican.

Barrett campaigned on how he was a "conservative Republican who will protect your constitutional rights and support fully funding public education" as well as how he was anti-abortion. Further, he stated his support for "accessible, affordable health care" and on helping rural hospitals.

Barrett is married with two children and is of Baptist faith. He is a member of Servitium (Formerly Kiwanis).
