Price Wallace (born November 24, 1961) is an American politician. He is a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from the 77th District, being first elected in 2018. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Born in Jackson, Mississippi, U.S., Wallace has made a significant impact in his role as a representative. His political journey began when he assumed office in 2018, succeeding Andy Gipson. Wallace's political affiliation is with the Republican Party, and he has been serving the people of the 77th district with dedication and commitment.

Wallace resides in Mendenhall, Mississippi, U.S., and by profession, he is a farmer. This background gives him a unique perspective on the agricultural issues that are often central to the concerns of his constituents.

In a controversial moment in November 2020, Wallace made a tweet from his official Twitter account in response to the victory of Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election. In the tweet, Wallace called for the state of Mississippi to "succeed [sic] from the union and form our own country." This tweet was later deleted, and Wallace apologized for posting it.

Despite this incident, Wallace continues to serve his district and contribute to the political landscape of Mississippi. His journey serves as an example of dedication to public service and the importance of representing the interests of one's constituents.
