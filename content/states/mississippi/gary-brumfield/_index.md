Gary Brumfield is a notable figure in Mississippi politics, representing the 38th district in the Mississippi State Senate since 2024. His district represents Adams, Amite, Pike, Walthall, and Wilkinson counties.

Born and raised in Mississippi, Brumfield's journey into politics was preceded by a strong academic background. He attended McComb High School, graduating in 1988. He then pursued higher education at Southwest Mississippi Community College, graduating in 1992 with an Associate degree in industrial electricity and robotics. His thirst for knowledge didn't stop there. He went on to Dallas Baptist University, where he earned a dual Bachelor's degree in Christian ministry and business management in 2008. He furthered his education by obtaining a Master of Ministry in 2022 from Anderson University.

Before his political career, Brumfield served as a senior pastor for a church in Pike County, Mississippi. He also held the position of president of the Southwest Mississippi Minister's Union. His dedication to his community and his faith is evident in his work.

In 2023, Brumfield, a Democrat, ran for office to the 38th district for the Mississippi State Senate. He ran uncontested in the Democratic primary. The general election saw him face off against incumbent Kelvin Butler, a former Democrat who filed as an independent. Brumfield won the election with 50.5% of the votes, making Butler the only senator to lose reelection in the 2023 cycle.

In the senate, Brumfield serves on several committees, including Ethics, Corrections, Economic and Workforce Development, Finance, Forestry, Highways and Transportation, Ports and Marine Resources, Technology, and Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks.

On a personal note, Brumfield is married and has three children. He is of Baptist faith, which plays a significant role in his life and work.
