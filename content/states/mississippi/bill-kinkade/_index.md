Bill Kinkade, born in 1957, is an American politician and a member of the Republican party. He represents the 52nd district in the Mississippi House of Representatives.

Kinkade was born to a military family and moved to Mississippi shortly after his birth. He served in the United States Air Force from 1975 to 1978 as Security Police and studied at the University of New Mexico. In 1992, Kinkade and his family became residents of Marshall County, Mississippi, and immediately became active in the community.

In 2012, former 52nd district representative Tommy L. Wood resigned, and a special election was held to replace him. Kinkade ran against Jeremy Bryan and Van Wicker. No candidate won a majority, and Kinkade and Bryan advanced to a runoff, which Kinkade won. In 2015 and 2019, Kinkade ran again and, both times, was unopposed in both the Republican primary and the general election.

As of June 2020, Kinkade sits on the following committees: Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks (Chair), Agriculture, Energy, Forestry, and Ways and Means.

Apart from his political career, Kinkade joined Champion Awards and Apparel, Inc. in 1988. Since 2006, he has served the company in the role of Vice-President. During his time at Champion, he has made waves in the industry, speaking at seminars, writing articles for industry publications, and consistently pushing for growth in his professional community.

Kinkade has also been active in various community services. He has made both time and financial contributions to the Byhalia Sports Association. Since 2000, he has served actively as a member of the Byhalia Chamber of Commerce, and as the Zoning and Planning representative for District 3: Marshall County since 2007. He was a Leadership Marshall graduate in 2007, served on the Board of Directors for AutoZone Liberty Bowl since 2010, and was the President of the Byhalia Chamber of Commerce from 2007 to 2009.
