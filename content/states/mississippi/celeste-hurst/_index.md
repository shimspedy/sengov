Celeste Hurst is a dedicated and passionate public servant who currently serves as a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives for the 75th District. She is affiliated with the Republican Party and has held her position since 2024.

Born on August 31 in Lauderdale, Mississippi, Celeste was raised in Newton County where she learned to value her family, her freedom, and the importance of hard work. After marrying her high school sweetheart, Mike, they moved to Washington, D.C., where she worked for then-Majority Leader Trent Lott.

In 2006, Celeste, Mike, and their family moved back home to Mississippi. Since then, Celeste has been very active in her Church, leading and mentoring newlyweds, mothers of young children, teenagers, and teaching young people. She has also served in leadership roles of various mission boards and Christian nonprofits around the metro area, including Gods Haven and the Jackson Leadership Foundation.

Celeste has been active in Republican politics for over two decades, working at various times for the Mississippi Republican Party, volunteering for multiple Republican 72-Hour Task Force operations throughout the United States in support of electing Republicans to office, and playing various leadership roles in her husband Mike's political campaign as the Republican candidate for the office of Mississippi Attorney General in 2015.

Celeste and Mike live in the Sandhill community of Rankin County, where their kids attend Pisgah Schools. They have five kids and also served as guardians of Mikes younger sister during her teenage years. It is because of her faith, coupled with her role as a mother, that Celeste felt called to serve the people of District 75 in the Mississippi House of Representatives.

Celeste believes her conservative principles of limited government, individual liberties, and free market capitalism, as well as protecting our constitutional rights and supporting our law enforcement, are exactly what Mississippi needs in order to become an even better place to live and raise a family. She is a fighter, and with her background, experience, grit, and determination, her servant leadership style is exactly what is desperately needed in the Mississippi House today.
