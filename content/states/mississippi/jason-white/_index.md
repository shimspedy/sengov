Jason Mark White, born on December 28, 1972, is an American politician and a member of the Republican party. He represents the 48th district in the Mississippi House of Representatives, having been first elected in 2011.

White was born and raised in Mississippi. He pursued his education at Mississippi College, where he received his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree. He furthered his education at the Mississippi College School of Law, earning his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree.

Before entering politics, White worked as an attorney in Holmes County in the town of West. He served as the president of the Mississippi Bar Association and Attala County Bar Association. He is also a member of the West Historical and Preservation Society and Attala County Farmers Co-op, and serves on the Board of Directors for the Attala County Forestry Association.

In 2011, White ran to succeed former Rep. Mary Ann Stevens, also of West, who was a conservative Democrat for the 48th district in the Mississippi House of Representatives. He won in the Democratic Primary against two other contenders and went unchallenged in the general election. Initially elected as a Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party in December 2012 after determining his social and budget issues were more in line with the Republican party.

White has had a successful political career since then. He won in a contested general election in 2015 with 69% of the vote, and won uncontested general races in 2019 and 2023. He voted in favor of changing the Mississippi state flag. In 2024, he was elected as the 62nd Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives following a unanimous vote from the other members. Prior to this, he served as House speaker pro tempore under House Speaker Philip Gunn.

As speaker, he runs the chamber, appoints representatives to committees, and determines which legislation is prioritized. He emphasized public school funding reform as one of his objectives in his first speech as speaker.

On the personal front, White is married to Jolynn McLellan and is of Baptist faith. They are blessed with three children.
