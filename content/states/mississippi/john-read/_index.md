- House Public Property Committee: Oversees state-owned assets and facilities.

During the 2015 legislative session, Read chaired the Conservation and Water Resources Committee, demonstrating his commitment to environmental stewardship. His leadership extended to committees related to gaming, public utilities, and more.

Beyond his legislative duties, Read remains engaged with his constituents. He values open communication and actively seeks input from the people he represents. His official website and personal Facebook page serve as platforms for connecting with the community.
