Charles Lemuel Young Jr. was born on July 9, 1962, in Meridian, Mississippi, U.S. He is an American politician and a member of the Democratic party. He represents the 82nd District in the Mississippi House of Representatives, a position he first assumed in 2012. His district includes Lauderdale County and the city of Meridian.

Charles Young Jr. is the son of Charles L. Young Sr., who also served in the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1980 until his death in 2009. His paternal grandfather is E. F. Young Jr., who founded a cosmetics firm and a hotel based in Meridian, Mississippi. His sister, Veldore Young-Graham, currently serves as the County Court Judge for Lauderdale County, Mississippi.

In terms of electoral history, Charles Young Jr. first won the Democratic primary for the 82nd district in 2011 against incumbent Wilbert Jones, securing 53.48% of the votes. He then won the general election with 100% of the votes. He has since been re-elected in the 2015 and 2019 elections, each time winning 100% of the votes in both the Democratic primary and the general election.

Charles Young Jr. is known for his political positions, particularly his vocal criticism of Mississippi House Bill 1523 (H.B. 1523), which was passed by the legislature in 2016. The bill allows individuals to discriminate against same-sex couples who have "deeply held religious beliefs or moral convictions" against such unions. Young has expressed his commitment to protecting and upholding every person's rights, regardless of his personal beliefs.

In 2020, he was involved in the Mississippi State Flag Controversy, as Mississippi remains the only state in the United States that incorporates the Confederate battle flag.
