Percy Willis Watson is an American politician. He serves as a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from the 103rd District, having been first elected in 1980. Watson is affiliated with the Democratic party.

Biography:
Percy Willis Watson was born on June 5, 1951, in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He grew up as one of 11 children in a family headed by P. W. and Eartha Watson. Watson's educational journey led him to the segregated L. J. Rowan High School, where he graduated as the valedictorian of his class in 1969. His academic prowess earned him a full scholarship to the University of Iowa, where he completed his B.A. in political science with special honors in May 1972. During his time at the University of Iowa, Watson was elected to the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa society. He then pursued legal studies at the University of Iowa College of Law, obtaining his J.D. (in an accelerated program) just two years later in 1974.

After completing his legal education, Watson ventured to Alaska, where he passed the state bar exam and worked as an attorney at the law firm of M. Ashley Dickerson, Inc. in Anchorage. However, he found his professional fulfillment lacking in Alaska and decided to return to his hometown of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, to practice law.

Political Career:
In June 1979, Watson, a Democrat, announced his candidacy to represent the 104th district, which included part of Hattiesburg, in the Mississippi House of Representatives. This district had recently been created due to redistricting ordered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi in the case of Connor v. Finch. Despite receiving racist hate mail during his campaign, Watson emerged victorious in the Democratic primary, defeating white attorney Michael B. "Mike" McMahan. As there was no Republican candidate, the primary effectively secured his election. Watson attributed his win to the district's black majority population.

During the 1980–1984 term, Watson served on various House committees, including Agriculture, Judiciary "A," and Universities & Colleges. He also chaired the House's Black Caucus. In the subsequent term (1983–1987), Watson ran unopposed for re-election in the 103rd District. Alongside 25 other representatives, he sought to diminish the power of the House Speaker, C. B. Newman, but their efforts did not succeed.

Watson's commitment to public service continued over the years. He has been engaged in the private practice of law in Hattiesburg since May 3, 1976. His enduring presence in Mississippi politics reflects his dedication to serving his constituents and advocating for their interests.

Watson's legacy extends beyond his political career. He remains an influential figure in Mississippi, contributing to the state's legal landscape and championing causes that matter to its citizens.
