Kathy L. Chism, born on August 22, 1957, in Aurora, Illinois, is an American politician who has been serving in the Mississippi State Senate from the 3rd district since 2020.

Early Life and Education:
Chism moved to Mississippi and attended Myrtle High School in Union County. After graduating, she attended Northeast Community College and Itawamba Community College.

Career:
Chism has had a diverse career as a realtor, auctioneer, and business owner. In 2019, she ran for a Mississippi State Senator for the 3rd district, which includes portions of Benton, Ponotoc, and Union counties. She got 50.8% percent of the vote in the Republican primary runoff and 75.3% in the general election; she assumed office on January 7, 2020.

Political Positions:
Chism has advocated for improvements regarding Mississippi's public education system. Prior to taking her seat, she called for a salary increase for public educators, a statewide public pre-K, and more opportunities for career and technical programs. In 2020, she filed a bill that would require health insurance agencies to help cover health care costs for hearing-impaired children. The bill died in committee. She filed an amicus brief against medical marijuana to the Mississippi Supreme Court and later voted against a separate senate bill creating a medical marijuana program. In 2021, she filed a bill to prevent burning of the U.S. flag, despite Supreme Court precedent allowing it. She voted against an economic development project for northern Mississippi. She voted against early in-person voting legislation. She was against changing the Mississippi State Flag. In July 2020, she falsely claimed that the Mississippi Flag was designed by an African American Confederate Soldier, which was later proved wrong by the Mississippi Historical Society. Chism was one of 14 senators to vote against the bill to change the Mississippi flag, arguing the people of Mississippi should be allowed to vote on the decision.

Personal Life:
Chism is a member of Union County Women, National Realtors Association, N. E. Board of Realtors, Republican Party Mississippi, and Mississippi Auctioneer. She is married and has one child and four grandchildren. She is a Baptist.
