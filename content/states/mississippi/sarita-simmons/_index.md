Sarita Simmons is an American politician who has been serving in the Mississippi State Senate from the 13th district since 2020. She was born on May 14, 1977, in Cleveland, Mississippi.

Simmons' father is Willie Lee Simmons, a former Mississippi Senate member from the 13th district and current Central District Transportation Commissioner. Her mother was the Bolivar County Circuit Clerk, the first African American since Reconstruction to serve that post.

Simmons attended Cleveland High School and graduated from Alcorn State University with a bachelor's degree in education and psychology. She has worked as the general manager for the family-owned restaurant, The Senator's Place, which is located in Cleveland, Mississippi.

When her father didn't file for re-election for the 13th district, she decided to run. The district encompasses parts of Bolivar, Sunflower, and Tallahatchie counties. She received 42.1% of the vote in the Democratic primary election and 65.1% in the general election; she assumed office on January 7, 2020.

In the Mississippi Senate, she serves as vice-chair for the Investigate State Offices Committee and is a member on the following committees: Agriculture; Appropriations; Corrections; Drug Policy; Environment Prot, Cons, and Water Res; Labor; Ports and Marine Resources; and State Library.

Simmons, in partnership with Senator Walter Michel, authored a bill to allow wine sales in grocery stores; the bipartisan bill died in the Senate Finance Committee. In coordination with several Delta Legislators, Simmons created a multi-step plan to address conditions at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Sunflower County, an infamous prison located in Simmon's 13th district. This came after lawmakers proposed additional cuts for funding to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. She voted for changing the Mississippi state flag.

She is a member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, NAACP, National Council of Negro Women, and the Bolivar County Democratic Executive Committee. She is a Christian.
