Danielle Conrad, born as Danielle Nantkes on August 5, 1977, in Seward, Nebraska, is a notable politician from the U.S. state of Nebraska. She has served in the Nebraska State Legislature, representing District 46 on the city of Lincoln's north side, from 2007 to 2015 and was elected again in 2023.

Danielle's early life was rooted in Nebraska. Her father served as a Deputy Sheriff for over 25 years, and her mother has been a teacher at Lincoln Public Schools for over 15 years. She graduated from Seward High School in 1995. She then pursued higher education at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, earning a B.A. in 2000. She furthered her education by earning her Juris Doctor at the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln College of Law in 2003.

After becoming a member of the Nebraska State Bar Association, she took a job with the Nebraska Appleseed Center for Law in the Public Interest. This non-profit, non-partisan law project provides legal counsel to the poor, minorities, and immigrants in the state of Nebraska.

A registered Democrat, Danielle first ran for elected office in 2006, seeking to represent the 46th Legislative District. With 55% of the vote, she defeated Republican Carol Brown for the non-partisan seat. Her standing committee assignments included Appropriations and Nebraska Retirement Systems. She also served on the Performance Audit Committee, Redistricting Committee, and chaired the Legislature's Innovation and Entrepreneurial Task Force.

During Danielle's time in office, she was one of only ten women in the 49-member Nebraska Legislature. Due to term limits, she did not seek re-election to the Legislature in 2014, and was succeeded by Adam Morfeld.

Danielle headed the ACLU of Nebraska since 2014. During her time, the number of staff grew from just four people to a team of ten full-time staff with two contact lawyers. Legal victories were won within LGBTQ equality, open government, and reproductive rights. She also supported expanding Medicaid eligibility, banning predatory payday lending, eliminating the last vestiges of slavery from Nebraska's state constitution, increasing the minimum wage, and increasing election participation through a mass mailing of vote-by-mail applications.

On a personal note, Danielle married Thomas Conrad on August 15, 2009, and they have two children: Caroline and Will. They reside in Lincoln, Nebraska.
