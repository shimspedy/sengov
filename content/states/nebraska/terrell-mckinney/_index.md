Terrell McKinney, born on August 17, 1990, in Omaha, Nebraska, is an American politician and a member of the Nebraska legislature. He has been representing the 11th district since 2021, succeeding Nebraska's longest-serving senator, Ernie Chambers.

McKinney is the 14th Black member of the Nebraska legislature, and the ninth since it converted to a unicameral body in 1937. He is known for his commitment to his community and his efforts to bring about positive change.

Before running for office, McKinney worked as a community organizer focusing on food insecurity, Medicaid expansion, and various other community initiatives. He has always been deeply involved in his community, serving as a wrestling coach within the North Omaha community.

In 2021, McKinney introduced a bill requiring school districts to include financial literacy in elementary and middle school curriculum. He also introduced a bill banning employment discrimination based on ethnic hairstyle. McKinney supported Republican John S. McCollister's bill to expand SNAP program benefits. He helped to override governor Pete Ricketts veto of the expansion, although he would have liked the expansion of SNAP to have been even larger.

McKinney supports community organizations serving Omaha's Black community. He presented a resolution commending the organization Black Men United for distributing food to those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In terms of education, McKinney is a graduate of Omaha North High Magnet School (2008). He earned his B.S. in sports business management from Maryville University in 2014 and his M.B.A. from Midland University in 2018. He is currently attending Creighton University School of Law.

McKinney is also a father to one child, Sanaâ€™a McKinney. His dedication to his family and his community is evident in his work and his actions. He continues to serve his community and strives to make a difference in the lives of those he represents.
