Tanya Storer is a member of the Republican Party serving in the Nebraska State Senate, representing District 43. She assumed office on January 8, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 3, 2029.

Born on January 20, 1969, in Gordon, Nebraska, Tanya grew up with a deep connection to the rural landscapes of her home state. She graduated from Valentine Rural High School in 1986 and later earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Consumer Science and Education from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1990. Her early life and education laid the foundation for her commitment to serving her community and advocating for rural issues.

Before her tenure in the Nebraska State Senate, Tanya had an extensive career in public service and community involvement. She served as a Cherry County Commissioner from 2014 to 2022, where she gained valuable experience in local governance and policy-making. Her leadership extended to various organizations, including the Nebraska Farm Bureau, where she held a position on the state board and served as the second vice-president from 2010 to 2016. She was also a member of the advisory board for the University of Nebraska Medical Center and participated in the University of Nebraska Presidential Search Committee.

Tanya's dedication to her community is evident in her active participation in numerous boards and commissions. She has been involved with the Family, Youth, and Community Partnership, the Lackey District Election Board, and the Carver District 170 School Board. Her commitment to education, agriculture, and rural development has been a consistent theme throughout her career.

In addition to her public service, Tanya is a rancher, a role that connects her directly to the agricultural roots of Nebraska. She is married to Eric Storer, and together they have three children: Braden, Hailey, and Emmet. Her family life and professional experiences have shaped her perspective and priorities as a legislator.

Tanya's achievements have been recognized through various honors, including being named the 2018 Volunteer of the Year by the Nebraska State Republican Party. Her work in the Nebraska State Senate continues to reflect her dedication to representing the interests of her constituents in District 43, focusing on issues such as rural development, education, and agriculture.
