Joni Albrecht, born as Joni Jones on July 28, 1958, in Omaha, is an American politician who has been serving in the Nebraska Legislature from the 17th district since 2017. She is a member of the Republican party.

Joni is a graduate of Papillion High School, class of 1976.

Joni is married to Michael D. Albrecht since July 3, 2010. They are blessed with six children: Gregory Albrecht, Laura Fischer, Scott Albrecht, Andrea Diehm, Michaela Kortus, and Cortney Girmus.

Before her tenure in the Nebraska Legislature, Joni served on the Papillion City Council from 1998 to 2005 and the Sarpy County Board of Commissioners from 2006 to 2010. Apart from her political career, she is also a farmer.

Joni Albrecht is known for her strong stance against abortion. She has introduced several bills to restrict it in the state of Nebraska. In 2017, she expressed her shock at the number of abortions in the state of Nebraska and emphasized the need for a change in perspective towards life.

In 2021, she introduced a resolution in the Nebraska Legislature recognizing Julie Schmit-Albin, the daughter of Nebraska Senator Loran Schmit. The resolution praised Schmit-Albin for having successfully shepherded numerous significant pro-life bills through the process to be signed into law by Nebraska governors.

On the topic of LGBTQ rights, in 2021, the Nebraska Department of Education proposed new state health education standards that would include lessons for kindergarteners about family structures, including families with same-gender parents. The standards would also teach first-graders about gender identity and gender stereotypes, and teach sixth-graders about sexual orientation. Albrecht was part of a group of 30 state legislators that signed a letter urging the Nebraska Department of Education not to adopt the standards.

Joni Albrecht was elected to the Nebraska Legislature in 2016 and re-elected in 2020. In the 2020 election for Nebraska's 17th district state legislature, she won with a significant margin.
