Tom Brewer is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Nebraska Legislature from the 43rd district since 2017. He was born on August 6, 1958, in Casper, Wyoming, and was raised around Gordon, Nebraska, and Whiteclay, Nebraska.

Brewer's journey in education began at Gordon High School, from where he graduated in 1977. He then went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from Doane University in 1984. His thirst for knowledge didn't stop there, as he later attended the United States Army War College.

Before his political career, Brewer served as a member of the United States Army for 36 years, including six tours in Afghanistan. His last tour was cut short after his vehicle was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade while he was changing a tire. Brewer suffered severe injuries, including shrapnel wounds, a punctured eye, and shredded ligaments. Despite these challenges, he showed immense bravery and resilience, for which he was awarded two Purple Hearts.

In 2016, Brewer decided to serve his country in a different way - through politics. He ran for election to the Nebraska State Senate to represent District 43 and won. He assumed office on January 4, 2017. His current term ends on January 8, 2025. Brewer ran for re-election in 2020 and was victorious.

As a legislator, Brewer has focused on veterans' issues, sponsoring a bill to provide tax breaks to veterans. He has also been vocal against Medicaid expansion. In 2022, Brewer made headlines for visiting the front lines and meeting with local officials in Ukraine for a "mission" trip. He believed that if the US did not help Ukraine, then American troops would eventually be fighting Russians.

On the personal front, Brewer is married to Kelli M. Young since November 24, 1984. They have two children: Travis J. Brewer and Kalee M. Boden. Kelli has served in the Nebraska National Guard. Brewer is a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe and holds the distinction of being the first Native American elected to the state legislature of Nebraska.
