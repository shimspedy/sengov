Bruce Lee Bostelman, born on July 20, 1962, is an American politician who has been serving in the Nebraska Legislature from the 23rd district since 2017. He was born in Superior, Nebraska, to Dwayne Bostelman and Avis Pingel and was baptized in the Lutheran faith.

After graduating from Superior High School in 1980, Bostelman joined the United States Air Force. He served as a security specialist through 1984, and then as a paralegal from 1985 to 2000. He received an associate's degree in paralegal science from the Community College of the Air Force and a Bachelor of Science in business management from Bellevue University in 2002. In 2001, he was promoted to director for Pre Paid Legal Services Inc.

In 2016, Bostelman was elected to the Nebraska Unicameral. In his 2016 and 2019 reelection campaign, Bostelman campaigned on issues of opposing tax increases, opposing extending public benefits to illegal immigrants, supporting veterans, opposing human trafficking, and retaining the death penalty. Among the bills Bostelman presented in 2017 was a bill to give spouses of active duty and recently discharged service members preference for hiring by government entities in Nebraska.

In 2018, Bostelman worked to weaken the Nebraska Public Records Act, pushing bills that gave exemptions to records created in the registration, possession, or sale of guns and that gave exemptions to public power utilities companies. Bostelman is noted for his anti-tax stance. He and Elmwood's Robert Clements received the top scores from anti-tax group, Nebraska Taxpayers for Freedom in 2019. Bostelman was the sole vote against allowing Gage County, Nebraska, to raise sales taxes to reimburse the exonerated Beatrice Six. He also supported Governor Pete Ricketts ' opposition of Critical Race Theory at the University of Nebraska in 2021.

In 2022, Bostelman served as chair of the Natural Resources Committee. In this role, he has been heavily involved in 2022 water disputes with Colorado, Nebraska's neighboring state to the west. He is also a key player in cleanup of the Mead, Nebraska AltEn factory pesticide contamination site. Bostelman received national media attention for a speech on the floor of the legislature in which he repeated a debunked rumor about schools providing litter boxes for students who identify as furries.
