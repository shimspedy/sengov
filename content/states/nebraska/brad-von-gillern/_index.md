Brad von Gillern, a member of the Republican Party, is a distinguished legislator serving the 4th district of the Nebraska Legislature. He assumed office on January 4, 2023, succeeding Robert Hilkemann.

Born on July 13, 1960, Brad's journey began in Lincoln, Nebraska. However, his family moved to Omaha when he was just an infant. He attended Omaha Public Schools and graduated from Burke High School in 1978. His pursuit of higher education led him to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, where he earned his Bachelor of Science Degree in Construction Management Engineering.

In 1981, Brad married his high school sweetheart, Mary. The couple has four children: Andrew, Alyssa, Chad, and Lindsey. After several years of working in the booming construction industry across the country, Brad returned home to Omaha in 1991. He accepted a Project Management role with Lueder Construction, a 138-year-old commercial building contractor. This return to his hometown marked a pivotal moment for Brad and his family, as he and Mary knew that Omaha was the place they wanted to raise their four young children.

Brad advanced quickly within the Lueder organization, accepting the role of Executive Vice President, and then was named President in 2000. He acquired majority ownership in 2006. He served as President, and then CEO until 2021, when he sold his remaining interest in the business to his leadership team as part of a strategic business transition. He currently serves as Director of Business Development.

Brad's deep desire to serve his community has taken many forms over the past three decades in Omaha. He is known for his leadership and deep commitment to his endeavors. His transparent, clear style of communication and his ability to generate consensus around sound strategies has allowed him to excel in business and has benefited numerous non-profit organizations.

Brad and Mary have been married for 40 years. Mary retired from residential real estate after a twenty-year career and serves the community in many capacities as a volunteer, including serving the Senior ministry at Lifegate Church for over ten years, providing homemade meals to over one hundred each week.

Brad is an Instrument-Rated Private Pilot, a sailor, golfer, and enjoys all outdoor activities. He and Mary have traveled the world as informal students, tourists, ambassadors, and in various forms of missions and service to others. They have four adult children and six grandchildren.
