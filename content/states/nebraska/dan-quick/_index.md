Born on December 29, 1957, in Grand Island, Nebraska, Dan Quick has deep roots in the community he represents. He graduated from Hordville High School in 1976 and has since dedicated much of his life to public service and community involvement. Before entering politics, Quick worked as a maintenance mechanic, welder, and heavy equipment operator. He also served as the president and business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1597, showcasing his commitment to advocating for workers' rights and fair labor practices.

Quick's political career began with his election to the Nebraska Legislature in 2016, where he served until 2021. After a brief hiatus, he returned to public office in 2025, reclaiming his position as the representative for District 35. Throughout his tenure, he has been an active participant in various legislative committees, including General Affairs, Health and Human Services, and Urban Affairs. His work on these committees reflects his dedication to addressing the needs of his constituents and improving the quality of life in his district.

In addition to his legislative duties, Quick has been involved in numerous community organizations. He has served on the boards of the Heartland United Way and the Nebraska Alliance for Child Advocacy Centers. A devout member of the Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, he has also contributed to the parish council and other church-related activities. His commitment to education is evident through his service on the Central Community College Board of Governors from 2022 to 2025.

Dan Quick's contributions to his community have not gone unnoticed. He has received several honors and awards, including the 2021 T.E.A.M. Advocate of the Year award and the 2020 Farmers Union Presidentâ€™s Award. These accolades highlight his dedication to public service and his ability to make a positive impact on the lives of those he represents.

Quick's personal life is equally fulfilling. He has been married to Alice Turek since April 26, 1980, and together they have three children: Michael, Stephen, and Christine. His family remains a source of inspiration and support as he continues to serve the people of Nebraska with integrity and passion.
