Robert Clements, born on December 11, 1950, in Lincoln, Nebraska, is an American politician and businessman. He graduated from Elmwood High School in Elmwood, Nebraska, in 1969. After high school, he pursued higher education at the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln, where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics, with honors, in 1973.

Clements has had a diverse professional career. He has worked as a banker, insurance agent, and tax preparer. Currently, he serves as a banker at the American Exchange Bank in Elmwood, Nebraska.

His political journey began when he was appointed to the Nebraska Legislature on February 6, 2017, to replace Bill Kintner. Since then, he has been an active member of the Republican Party and has represented the 2nd district in the Nebraska State Senate. His tenure has been marked by his commitment to his constituents and his party.

In the recent past, Clements has been involved in some controversies. He became a leading state election denier by embracing "the Big Lie" (President Trump's false claims of a stolen election) following the 2020 presidential contest by insisting Donald Trump actually won. He signed a public letter demanding a "forensic audit of every state election" similar to the fruitless 2021 Maricopa County presidential ballot audit. That same year, he joined a fringe right-wing group, the Nebraska Freedom Coalition, in asking for a state-backed effort to audit the 2020 Nebraska election results, specifically in Douglas and Sarpy counties, despite no evidence of fraud.

Despite these controversies, Clements has continued to serve his constituents. He ran for re-election to the Nebraska State Senate to represent District 2 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022. His current term ends on January 6, 2027.

Throughout his tenure, Clements has been assigned to various committees. In the 2023-2024 legislative session, he served as the Chair of the Appropriations Committee and was also a member of the Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee.

Clements' journey from a student to a successful businessman and then a politician is a testament to his dedication and commitment to serving his community. His story continues to unfold as he serves the people of Nebraska.
