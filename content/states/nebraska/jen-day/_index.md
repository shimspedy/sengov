Jen Day, born on July 28, 1981, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, is an American politician, weightlifter, and a member of the Nebraska Legislature. She is a representative of the 49th district and assumed office on January 6, 2021.

Day's journey into activism began in 2010, where she advocated for public education among other topics. Her passion for weightlifting led her to participate in the IFW World Masters Championship weightlifting competition in 2016, where she finished in 7th place.

In 2020, she ran for a seat in the state's unicameral legislature, defeating incumbent Andrew La Grone. The race was marked by an incident in which La Grone's campaign mailed an attack ad flyer to voters with a misidentified photograph â€” the flyer featured a volunteer on Day's campaign mislabeled as Day herself.

As a member of the legislature's education committee, Day has advocated for school epilepsy safety and for freedom of the press for high school student newspapers. She supports legal abortion, saying "the Nebraska Legislature must reject medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion."

Day is not just a politician, but also a business owner and fitness coach. She is married to Jonathan Day and they have two children. Since 2016, Day has been president of the Nebraska Local Weightlifting Committee.

Born and raised in her home district, she has spent her lifetime building community and advocating for social justice issues. As a business owner, activist, and mother of 2 boys, she initially sought a legislative seat to address the needs of her community, specifically working-class families.
