Carol Blood, born as Carol Vacek on March 5, 1961, in McCook, Nebraska, is an American politician from the U.S. state of Nebraska. She represents District 3 in Sarpy County in the Nebraska Legislature. She was first elected to this position in 2016 with 51.56% of the vote. In 2020, she was re-elected with 50.4% of the vote.

Carol graduated from Adams Central High School in 1979 and later attended Metropolitan Community College. Before her political career, she worked as a business consultant, the CEO of the La Vista Chamber of Commerce, and a business specialist with Nebraska Self Employment Services. She has also served as the chair of the Bellevue Farmers Market.

In 2008, Carol was elected to the Bellevue, Nebraska, City Council as the at-large representative. She was re-elected to the city council in 2012. She has been a member of the Bellevue Public Safety Foundation Board since 2005, serving as chair for seven years. The organization supports police and fire department activities in Bellevue.

In 2014, Carol was defeated by Tommy Garrett in a race to fill the two years remaining of a four-year legislative term vacated by state senator Scott Price, who resigned in November 2013. However, in 2016, she defeated Republican incumbent Tommy Garrett with 51.4% of the votes. Her campaign focused on "common sense tax relief" and eliminating taxes on social security and military retirement once Nebraska lawmakers address a $1 billion budget shortfall. She also said education and public safety were among her top priorities.

On May 12, 2020, Carol defeated Rick Holdcroft with 50.4% of the vote for the general election held November 3, 2020. She is a member of the Democratic Party, though elections to the Nebraska Legislature are officially nonpartisan. She is also running for election to the U.S. House to represent Nebraska's 1st Congressional District. She is on the ballot in the Democratic primary.
