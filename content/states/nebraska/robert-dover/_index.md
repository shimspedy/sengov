Robert Dover is a distinguished member of the Nebraska Legislature, representing the 19th district. He was appointed to this position by Governor Pete Ricketts on July 22, 2022, to fill the seat of former Senator Mike Flood who resigned after being elected to the United States House of Representatives.

Born on December 21, 1958, in Norfolk, Nebraska, Dover is a proud graduate of Norfolk High School. He furthered his education at Wayne State College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Finance and Spanish in 1988.

Before his political career, Dover was a successful real estate entrepreneur. He is a graduate of the Real Estate Institute, a licensed real estate broker, and an Accredited Buyer Representative. His expertise in the field led him to serve as a Nebraska real estate commissioner from 2007 to 2013.

Dover is also an active member of his community. He has served on the board of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and the Joint Economic Development Initiative. He is also a member of the Norfolk Chamber of Commerce, the Century Member of the Boy Scouts of America, the Nebraska Realtors Association, and the National Association of Realtors.

Over the years, Dover has been recognized for his contributions to his profession and his community. In 1998, he received the Outstanding Service Award from the Nebraska Realtors Association, and in 1997, he was named Realtor of the Year by the Norfolk Board of Realtors.

On a personal note, Dover is happily married to Ann Bernadette Schneider since August 8, 1993. They are proud parents of four children: Randi, Katherine “Kat,” Erica, and Richard.

In his current role as a state senator, Dover is committed to serving his constituents and making a positive impact on his community. His dedication to public service and his extensive experience in business and real estate make him a valuable asset to the Nebraska Legislature.
