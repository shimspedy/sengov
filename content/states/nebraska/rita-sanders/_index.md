Rita Gomez Sanders is an American politician serving as a Republican member of the Nebraska State Senate, representing the 45th district. She was born on June 30, 1958, in Oahu, Hawaii. Her father is of Filipino descent and her mother is of German descent.

In her early life, Sanders lived in Oahu, Hawaii, until she completed the 5th grade. Her family then moved to Germany for five years, where she completed middle school. After that, they moved to Livermore, California, where she graduated high school. Sanders attended Bryman College in Alhambra, California, where she completed her education in dental assisting. Since 2005, Sanders has been taking courses at Bellevue University, located in Bellevue, Nebraska.

Sanders settled down in Bellevue, which is where she started her family. She is married to Rick Ren√© Sanders and they have two sons, John Lukes and Michael Lukes.

Before her political career, Sanders worked as a commercial real estate developer. She was elected Mayor of Bellevue, Nebraska in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. She served as mayor for 8 years and did not run for a third term in 2018.

In the 2020 general election, Sanders was elected as a Nebraska State Senator representing district 45. She received 53.8% of the votes in the general election, defeating her opponent, Susan Hester, who received 46.2% of the votes. Sanders assumed office on January 6, 2021.

During her tenure, Sanders was assigned to the Education Committee as well as the Government, Military, and Affairs Committee for the years 2021-2022. She introduced the Legislative Bill 389, an amendment to Statute 79-813, Teachers' and administrators' certificates or permits; reciprocity; requirements. This bill adds Military Spouse Teacher Certification Reciprocity to Statute 79-813. LB 389 requires the state to issue certificates and permits to military spouse applicants that have been relocated to Nebraska and have valid certificates or permits in another state. These certificates and permits must contain similar endorsements as the certificates or permits issued to the applicants in another state. This bill also requires the state to issue a preliminary permit to applicants after they have submitted an application. This preliminary permit is temporary and valid until the commissioner has completed reviewing their application. Governor Pete Rickets approved this bill on 31 March 2021.
