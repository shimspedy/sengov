Lynne Walz is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Nebraska State Senate. She represents District 15, which includes Fremont, Nebraska, and surrounding areas. Despite the Nebraska Unicameral being a nonpartisan elected body, Lynne is a proud member of the Democratic Party.

Born as Lynne Shallberg on June 18, 1963, in Fremont, Lynne's journey is deeply rooted in her home state. She graduated from Arlington High School in 1981 and went on to earn a B.A. in Elementary Education from Midland Lutheran College in 1994.

Lynne's personal life is as fulfilling as her professional one. She married Christopher Walz on June 21, 1986, and they are blessed with three children: Adam, Patrick, and Emma. They also have three grandchildren, adding joy to their family.

Before entering politics, Lynne had a successful career as a teacher. She worked for Fremont Public Schools and Archbishop Bergan, shaping the minds of young Nebraskans. She is also a realtor at Don Peterson and Associates, showcasing her versatility in professional roles.

Lynne's political career is marked by significant achievements. She was first elected to the Nebraska Legislature in 2016 and was re-elected in 2020. Lynne's commitment to her constituents and her effective leadership led to her victory against incumbent David Schnoor with 51% of the vote in her first election.

In 2018, Lynne was chosen as the running mate (Lieutenant Governor) of fellow State Senator Bob Krist for his campaign for Governor. Although the Krist-Walz ticket did not win the election, it was a testament to Lynne's growing influence in Nebraska politics.

Lynne won re-election on November 3, 2020, against David Rogers with a convincing 59.6% of the votes. However, she will be term-limited in 2025, marking the end of her tenure in the Nebraska Legislature.

Throughout her political career, Lynne has been an active participant in various committees. At the beginning of the 2017 Legislative Session, she sat on the Education and Natural Resources Committees. From 2019 till now, she has been a part of both the Health and Human Services and Education Committee. In 2021, she ran for Education Chair and won against incumbent Senator Mike Groene.

Lynne Walz's journey is a testament to her dedication to public service and her commitment to the people of Nebraska. Her work in education and her leadership in the Nebraska Legislature have left a lasting impact on her constituents and the state.
