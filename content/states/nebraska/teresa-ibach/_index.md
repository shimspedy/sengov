Teresa J. Ibach, born as Teresa Heusman on December 7, 1961, in Lincoln, is a member of the Nebraska Legislature for District 44 from Sumner, Nebraska. She was elected to the Nebraska Legislature on November 8, 2022.

Teresa grew up in rural Dawson County and currently lives six miles from her original family farm. She and her husband Greg went to Junior High and High School together at Sumner-Eddyville-Miller. After high school, they both went to the University of Nebraska and were married in June of 1988.

Greg and Teresa have three children, triplets, born in 1991. All three graduated from SEM and all three received their degrees in agriculture from UNL and have wonderful careers.

Teresa retired in 2015 from a career in marketing and administration, with the goal of supporting the family farming and ranching operation while Greg continued with his position as Director of Agriculture for the state of Nebraska. Greg later became a Presidential appointee at the USDA in the Trump administration.

Teresa commuted back and forth from D.C. for nearly four years as she worked to manage the finances of their farm and ranch. As a volunteer on numerous boards, Teresa has been committed to contributing her time to the organizations and foundations that have richly rewarded the agricultural industry in Nebraska.

She is a member of the board of the NEBRASKAland Foundation, the Nebraska Farm Bureau Foundation, the Nebraska FFA Foundation, and a trustee of the University of Nebraska Foundation. She is also a volunteer and teacher for Junior Achievement and a member of the United Church of Sumner.

Teresa was a former member of the board of the Nebraska 4-H Foundation and Friends of Lied (board, executive committee, LIEDER publication editor).
