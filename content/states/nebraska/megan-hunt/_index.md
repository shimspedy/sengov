Megan Catherine Hunt, born on May 9, 1986, in Blair, Nebraska, is an American entrepreneur and politician currently serving as a member of the Nebraska Legislature. She represents the 8th legislative district in Omaha, which consists of the midtown neighborhoods of Dundee, Benson, and Keystone. She succeeded term-limited Nebraska State Senator Burke Harr.

Hunt is a sixth-generation Nebraskan who has lived and worked in the Dundee and Benson neighborhoods for the past 17 years. She is a seasoned entrepreneur who founded Hello Holiday, a community-facing boutique and e-commerce company supporting independent fashion designers. The company is best known for its “Girls Support Girls” messaging and fundraising collaborations with local nonprofit organizations.

Today, Megan is the owner of Five Nine Shop and Project, a paper goods store, gallery, and studio in Benson. She has a 13-year-old daughter who is an eighth grader at Lewis and Clark Middle School.

In the Nebraska Legislature, Hunt has introduced 45 bills and resolutions and cosponsored 131 bills since she was elected in 2018. Fifty-six of these bills passed with the support of the 49-member Legislature and were signed by the Governor. Her original legislation ranges from hyper-local topics like city board appointments, tenants’ rights, and grants for creative arts districts, to more controversial subjects like nonconsensual pornography and sex trafficking.

Megan is also the founder and Vice President of Safe Space Nebraska, a 501 (c)3 working to end harassment and assault in nightlife establishments. She is a trustee of the Business Ethics Alliance and has served on the boards of Charles Drew Health Center, Friends of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Friends of the Nebraska AIDS Project, and Omaha Area Youth Orchestras.

Born and raised in Blair, Nebraska, her parents instilled in her the value of hard work, determination, and the importance of public service. While attending Blair High School, Megan worked as a cook for a local catering company and as a member of a hot air balloon crew, where she developed relationships within her community and gained an appreciation for the sense of accomplishment that comes from working on a team.

She began attending Dana College her senior year of high school as a Presidential Scholar. During this time, she worked as a newspaper reporter and as a retail clerk at a locally-owned record store. After graduating with her Bachelor’s in Intercultural Communication and German in 2008, Megan continued her education in the University of Nebraska-Omaha’s Political Communication Master’s program and coached the Blair High School Forensics team for four years.

As a business owner, community leader, and parent, Megan has worked with commitment and discipline to help people from all walks of life prosper in our state. Her track record stems from her belief that the more everyday Nebraskans are empowered and supported to improve their quality of life, the easier it is for all of us to live the good life in the Cornhusker State.
