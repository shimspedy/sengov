Raymond Aguilar, born on October 24, 1947, is an American politician and businessman serving as a member of the Nebraska Legislature from the 35th district. His appointment in 1999 made him the first Latino in the legislature. In November 2020, Aguilar defeated sitting Senator Dan Quick to regain his seat in legislature.

Aguilar was born in Grand Island, Nebraska. He graduated from Grand Island Senior High School in 1965 and attended Central Community College. Aguilar worked as building and grounds supervisor for Grand Island Central Catholic middle and high school. He later owned a janitorial service, which he operated at the time of his departure from the Nebraska legislature.

In 1996, mayor Ken Gnadt appointed Aguilar to the Grand Island city council to serve the five months remaining in the term of a councilman who had moved outside the city limits. In 1998, Aguilar ran for election to the same council seat; he was defeated by incumbent Bob Sorensen.

In 1999, governor Mike Johanns appointed Aguilar to fill a vacancy in the Nebraska Legislature, created by the resignation of Chris Peterson. Upon taking his seat, he became the first Latino in the Legislature. In 2000, Aguilar ran for election to the seat. In the nonpartisan primary, Aguilar, a Republican, ran against Democrat Lonnie Logan, a member of the Hall County Board of Supervisors, and Libertarian Larry Gibreal, a realtor. Aguilar received 62.2% of the total votes and won the seat with 73.1% of the total votes in the general election.

In 2004, Aguilar ran unopposed for a second four-year term in the legislature. Under Nebraska's term-limits law, he was ineligible to run for a third consecutive term in 2008. He was succeeded in the Legislature by Mike Gloor, a Republican from Grand Island.

In 2020, Aguilar announced his candidacy to return to the Nebraska Legislature. With 12,295 votes counted in Hall County, Aguilar won the seat back from State Senator Dan Quick with 53.4% of the vote, according to preliminary unofficial results.
