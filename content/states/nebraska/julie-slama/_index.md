Julie Slama, born on May 2, 1996, in Lincoln, Nebraska, is an American politician who serves in the Nebraska Legislature from the 1st district since 2019. She graduated from Auburn High School in 2014 and went on to pursue higher education at Yale University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in political science in 2018. During her time at Yale, she served as the director of operations for Yale Daily News. She furthered her education at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where she graduated in 2022.

Before her political career, Slama was an alternate delegate to the 2014 United States Senate Youth Program. During the 2018 gubernatorial election, she worked as the press secretary for Pete Ricketts's gubernatorial campaign. Her political career began when Dan Watermeier, a member of the Nebraska Legislature from the 1st district, was elected to the Nebraska Public Service Commission in 2018, and vacated his seat. Slama applied for the position and was appointed to the seat by Ricketts. She was the youngest member of the legislature's 2019 session and the third-youngest person to serve in the state legislature.

In the 2020 election, Slama announced her campaign on July 10, 2019, and placed first in the primary against Janet Palmtag and Dennis Schaardt. She defeated Palmtag, who had the endorsement of former Governor Dave Heineman and U.S. Representative Jeff Fortenberry. Jessica Flanagain was her campaign manager. She defeated Palmtag in the general election. Slama declined to file for re-election on February 15, 2024, and will retire at the end of her term.

During Slama's tenure in the state legislature, she has served on the Judiciary, Natural Resources, Reference, and Executive Board committees. In 2021, she sought the position of vice-chair of the Executive Board committee, but lost to Senator Tony Vargas. Slama was named legislator of the year by the Young Republicans and placed on the Forbes 30 Under 30 in 2019. In 2022, Slama accused Charles Herbster of reaching up into her skirt at an event hosted by the Douglas County Republican Party in 2019. Both filed lawsuits against each other, but later dropped them.

Slama proposed legislation to require students in 8th and 11th grade to pass the American Civics Test. She proposed legislation to expand the castle doctrine to include occupied vehicles. She supported an attempt to call a special legislative session to pass legislation to prohibit vaccine requirements by businesses, governmental entities, and schools.

On a personal note, Slama married Andrew La Grone on December 18, 2021. She is also a recent convert to Catholicism and has drawn inspiration from the 19-year-old French commander St. Joan of Arc. She recommends the example of her patron to anyone considering a mission in the pro-life movement.
