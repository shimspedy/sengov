Mike Jacobson is an American politician, businessman, and banker currently serving as a member of the Nebraska Legislature from the 42nd district. He was appointed by Governor Pete Ricketts on February 23, 2022.

Born on November 26, 1953, in Hastings, Nebraska, Mike was raised on a share-rented farm near Sutton. He graduated from Sutton Public High School in 1972 and went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Economics/Agricultural Education from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1976. He also attended the Colorado Graduate School of Banking in 1984 and the RMA Loan Management School in Columbus, Ohio, in 1989.

After graduation, Mike returned to farm and teach agriculture for a short time at the high school level in Red Cloud and Shickley. He then began his banking career in 1980 as an Agricultural Lending Officer at City National Bank in Hastings. In 1984, he moved to Lincoln and worked as Senior Vice President/Division Manager of the National Bank of Commerce.

In 1998, Mike became the Founder and Principal Shareholder of NebraskaLand Bank in North Platte that has successfully grown to over $850 million in total assets with branches in Kearney and Rock Springs, Wyoming.

A recognized leader in state and local issues, Mike is a common-sense problem solver who has earned the reputation of standing strong on conservative principles â€“ lower taxes, smaller government, and defender of life. He is a pro-life conservative, who is trusted to protect taxpayers from high taxes, runaway spending, and is part of the solution to find meaningful property tax relief. He fights against those injecting Critical Race Theory and radical health policies into our schools and universities.

As the proud parents of two adult children, Mike and his wife Julie have been married for 47 years and always put family first. Mike has worked to make a positive difference for families in Western Nebraska. He is active in his local church and works in support of charitable efforts in the community. Senator Jacobson currently serves on Agriculture, General Affairs, and Natural Resources Committees.
