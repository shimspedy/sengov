Bob Andersen is a Republican serving in the Nebraska State Senate, representing District 49. He assumed office on January 8, 2025, and his current term is set to end in January 2029.

Born on February 11, 1963, in Tiffin, Ohio, Andersen has a rich and diverse background that has shaped his career in public service. He graduated from Seaholm High School in 1981 and later pursued higher education at the Community College of the U.S. Air Force, earning an associate degree in interpreting and translating Russian in 1988. He furthered his education by obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Business Management from Peru State College in 2002.

Andersen's professional journey is equally impressive. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1982 to 2003, where he worked as a Russian linguist, signals analyst, and RC-135 aircrew member. After retiring from the military, he transitioned into roles as a defense contractor and small business owner, leveraging his extensive experience and leadership skills.

In addition to his professional achievements, Andersen is deeply committed to his community. He is a member of St. Patrick’s Church, the American Legion, the National Rifle Association, and 88 Tactical. His dedication to service is further reflected in the numerous medals and awards he received during his time in the Air Force.

Andersen's legislative priorities include addressing issues related to veterans' affairs, urban development, and homeland security. He serves on several committees, including General Affairs, Government, Military and Veterans Affairs, and Urban Affairs, where he works to advance policies that benefit his constituents and the state of Nebraska.

A family man, Andersen has been married to Julie O’Donnell since March 16, 1996, and they have two children, Joe and Jack. His life and career exemplify a commitment to service, leadership, and community engagement.
