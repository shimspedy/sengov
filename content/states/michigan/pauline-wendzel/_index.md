Professional and personal
Pauline is lifelong Bainbridge Township resident from a proud fourth generation farming family.

Growing up and working on her family farm, counseling young children at Five Pines Christian Day Camp, preserving Southwest Michigan heritage as a director at a local museum, and serving as the deputy clerk of Bainbridge Township, Pauline learned the value of hard work and getting the job done right. Pauline takes that same work ethic to Lansing every day as she fights for the hardworking residents of Southwest Michigan.
