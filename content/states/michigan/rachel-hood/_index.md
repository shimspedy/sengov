State Rep. Rachel Hood is serving her third term and currently represents the 81st House District, which covers north east Grand Rapids, Ada, Grand Rapids and southern Plainfield Townships. Hood has spent her career developing, financing and implementing innovative urban investment, water protection and energy conservation solutions. She is a graduate of Michigan State University’s James Madison College, where she earned a degree in public policy. During her time as representative, Hood has been a strong advocate for climate solutions, water protection & recreation, health care, education and veterans. Rep. Hood serves as a representative of the State of Michigan on the Great Lakes Legislative Caucus.

Hood began her professional career as the executive director of the West Grand Neighborhood Organization working in crime prevention and community development. After leaving the organization, she spent time consulting for a variety of clients, including serving as a co-creator of Local First of West Michigan. She then went on to serve as the community relations manager at Metro Health Hospital, where she helped the health system prepare to operate in the Midwest’s first green-built health care campus.

As a lifelong advocate for the environment, Hood spent a decade as the executive director of the West Michigan Environmental Action Council. While there, she helped form Grand Rapids’ stormwater asset management strategies, developed a watershed education program to serve West Michigan students and spearheaded innovative clean energy policy and programs. Hood also served as a strategist for Dig Deep Research, which helps municipalities find and secure millions in funding for water and energy infrastructure projects.

When she’s back home in Grand Rapids, Hood is likely to be found gardening, biking, camping or community-building with her husband Dave and their two children.
