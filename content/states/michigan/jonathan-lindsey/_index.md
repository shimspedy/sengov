ABOUT
State Sen. Jonathan Lindsey was elected in 2022 to represent the 17th Senate District, which includes Cass, St. Joseph and Branch counties and parts of Berrien, Calhoun, Jackson and Hillsdale counties.

HISTORY
Lindsey grew up in rural Branch County. He graduated from Bronson High School and went on to attend Yale University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. He then enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he completed infantry training, airborne school, Special Forces Assessment and Selection, and the Special Forces qualification course — ultimately earning the coveted Green Beret.

During his time in the U.S. Army Special Forces, Lindsey served in three combat deployments — one in Afghanistan and two in the Middle East. He was recognized with a Bronze Star, a Joint Service Commendation Medal, and various other awards.

COMMUNITY
After leaving the Army in 2016, he worked as a communications executive in the private sector, advancing tobacco harm reduction efforts, with a focus on helping the veteran community.

His focus is returning constitutionally based, limited government to our state and creating a stronger, more prosperous Michigan for future generations.

FAMILY
He considers his family to be the greatest blessing in life. He married Allison Laffer Lindsey in 2015 and they have three children together.
