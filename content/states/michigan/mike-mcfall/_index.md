State Rep. Mike McFall is serving his second term representing the 14th House District, which includes parts of Oakland County and Wayne County, including Center Line, Madison Heights, Hazel Park and part of Warren.

Rep. McFall worked his way through college, graduating from Central Michigan University with a bachelor of science in community development and public administration. He spent much of his career in the nonprofit sector and worked for the Williams Syndrome Association before being elected.

Once Rep. McFall and his husband moved to Hazel Park, they immediately fell in love with the community and how close the houses are to one another, allowing for a strong community spirit and comradery to look out for each other. The love for his community led to Rep. McFall to join Hazel Park’s City Council, where he played an integral part in community building. He is proud to be accessible and responsive to the people he serves as their representative. He always appreciates the opportunity to build a reputation as a person who listens to concerns and gets work done.

Like so many other families, Rep. McFall’s family has experienced a mental health crisis, and the difficulty of finding someone to help during that time was a complete shock. The poor mental health system is the root of many of the issues the state faces, including homelessness and drug addiction. Rep. McFall realized he couldn’t help fix it all from Hazel Park and knows the hard work continues at the Capitol.

Michiganders’ priorities are his priorities, ranging from protecting our water to helping working families and rebuilding the economy rebound from the effects of the pandemic.
