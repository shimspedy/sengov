State Senator Darrin Quiroz Camilleri is currently in his first term serving Senate District 4 following three successful terms in the State House of Representatives. He is also the Assistant Majority Leader, Chairman of the PreK-12 School Aid Budget, and serves on committees that encompass Elections, Energy, Transportation, Labor and more. His district spans seventeen communities across Downriver and Western Wayne County, including his hometown of Brownstown Township as well as the City of Trenton, where he currently lives.

Since he was first elected in 2016, Camilleri has consistently introduced legislation to keep Michigan’s promises to working people and help everyday Michiganders get ahead. Notably, he has been an outspoken voice on labor issues, and recently introduced legislation to repeal Michigan’s so-called “Right to Work” law and restore collective bargaining power for workers across the state. As a proud former teacher, he has also worked extensively on improving outcomes for Michigan students and finding solutions to combat the state’s literacy crisis and teacher shortage.

Camilleri is very proud of his family’s new American story. As the son of an immigrant from Malta and a Latina, he became Michigan’s youngest Latino and first-ever Maltese-American state legislator when he was first elected. As the son and grandson of union auto workers, he has also been steadfast in his pursuit of opportunity for all communities in Michigan. Camilleri is also a first-generation college graduate, earning his degree from Kalamazoo College, and is deeply committed to working to expand college access for all kids.

Camilleri currently lives in Trenton, and enjoys playing pick-up basketball, bowling, reading, traveling, and spending time with his family.
