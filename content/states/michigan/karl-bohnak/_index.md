District

Rep. Karl Bohnak was first elected to the state House of Representatives in November 2024. He serves the 109th House District, which includes the counties of Alger, Baraga, Marquette, and portions of Dickinson including the townships of Breen, Felch, Norway, Waucedah, and West Branch as well as the cities of Ishpeming, Marquette, Munising, Negaunee, and Norway.

Committees

Bohnak serves as vice chair of the House Committee on Economic Competitiveness. He also serves as a member of the Natural Resources and Tourism, Health Policy, and Transportation and Infrastructure committees.

Background

A love of snow drew Bohnak north to the Upper Peninsula nearly 40 years ago where he became chief meteorologist at WLUC-TV6 in Marquette. He’s been there ever since. Weather has been Bohnak’s passion since his youth, to this day he is captivated by learning about and informing people of interesting, extreme weather.

But Bohnak is more than just a meteorologist.  He is also an author and historian. His award-winning book, “So Cold a Sky” was released in 2006. His next effort, “Michigan’s Upper Peninsula Almanac” was co-written with Ron Jolly. His latest book, “Sunburns to Snowstorms, Upper Michigan Weather in Pictures and Stories” is a collaboration with photo historian Jack Deo.

Personal

Bohnak and his wife, Liz, live in Deerton with their beloved cat Gracie. He has two sons and a twin sister who live in the Milwaukee area. He also has three grandchildren.

Community Involvement

Bohnak is a past co-chair and former member of the United Way of Marquette County. He is still broadcasting daily radio weather updates in Newberry and Sault Ste. Marie.
