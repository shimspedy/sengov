After earning a Master’s degree in crop and soil sciences with a specialization in environmental toxicology, Julie Brixie ran a mobile laboratory, conducting investigations and cleanups of contaminated sites all over Michigan. One standout project was the remediation of the 24-acre Motor Wheel, Inc. Superfund site in Lansing, identified as one of the worst hazardous waste sites in the nation by the EPA.

In 1998, urged by neighbors, Julie decided to get involved and fight against the commercial encroachment of her neighborhood. She filled out an application for public service with Meridian Township to advocate for her neighborhood. After serving on the Zoning Board of Appeals and Planning Commission in 1998 and 1999, Julie was elected to the Meridian Township Board, dedicating 18 years to her community, including two terms as a Trustee and three terms as Treasurer.

Julie's two decades of service to Meridian Township include:

- As a member of the Meridian Township Board, she played a key role in generating $1.4 billion of sustainable investment and growth in property values. She placed 954 acres of ecologically valuable land, over 16% of available land, into the public trust for permanent preservation, pioneering Meridian Township’s Land Preservation Program.
- Julie invested in clean, smart renewable energy, introduced curbside recycling to every home, and supported the passage of Ingham County’s farm preservation millage.
- Amidst challenges faced by other communities in Michigan with unfunded pension and retiree health care plans, Julie worked to put Meridian Township in the strongest financial health of any community in the state. She developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to fully fund Meridian Township’s retirement plans.
- Recognizing the neglected state of neighborhood roads, Julie invested an additional $1 million in her first year on the Meridian Township Board to repair them. She also played a role in creating the neighborhood road millage and continued investing funds to maintain neighborhood roads.
- Julie raised over $50,000 to support the relocation and expansion of the Haslett and Okemos Libraries to larger facilities, meeting the needs of 21st-century libraries without raising taxes.

After two decades of steering Meridian Township through recessions and charting a prosperous course for its future, Julie recognized that her hard work, knowledge, and leadership were needed more at the state Capitol.

Julie encourages constituents to contact her with thoughts, ideas, and concerns at (517) 373-1786 or via email at juliebrixie@house.mi.gov, as they work together to build a brighter future for Michigan.
