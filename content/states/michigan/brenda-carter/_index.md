State Representative Brenda Carter, currently in her third term, is dedicatedly serving the 53rd House District, which includes Pontiac and parts of Waterford and Auburn Hills. Born as the fifth of 13 children to John H. Canty and Mary S. Wallace, Carter's educational journey took her from high school in Detroit to Michigan State University, Spring Arbor College, and Oakland University. Holding a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a specialization in organizational design and a Master's degree in Public Administration with a focus on local government, she is also a graduate fellow of the Michigan Political Leadership Program and holds certifications as a grant writer and fiscal consultant.

Beyond her legislative role, Carter has a rich history of community involvement. Joining the Improved Benevolent Protective Order of Elks in 1975, she held various positions, including state director of education and national areas, grand trustee, grand auditor, and grand directress of public relations. A founding member of the Million Woman March, Carter's engagement with these organizations propelled her on a global speaking tour, taking her to the U.S., northeastern Africa, Israel, Egypt, and the Caribbean. Notably, she opened for then-Senator Barack Obama at one of her speaking engagements.

Upon moving to Pontiac, Carter immediately immersed herself in community work, starting with the Pontiac Community School Improvement team. She later contributed to the programming of Pontiac Northern’s Huskie Brigade Robotics Team, which won F.I.R.S.T’s International Championship during her involvement.

Carter is an active member of several organizations, including the Council of Urban Boards of Education, National School Board Association, Oakland County School Board Association, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., and New Mount Moriah International Church. Additionally, she serves on the board of directors or the executive committees of various organizations, such as the Michigan-Shiga Sister State Board of Directors.

As the first woman to hold the state representative seat for District 53, Carter founded five district task force groups focusing on education, veteran’s services, poverty and homelessness, minority maternal health, and criminal justice reform. She is the chair and co-founder of the bi-partisan and bi-cameral poverty and homelessness caucus.

Brenda Carter and her husband, Randy, call Pontiac, Michigan, home. They are proud parents of six children and grandparents to five grandchildren.
