State Representative Denise Mentzer is currently in her inaugural term representing the 61st District in the House. This district includes Mount Clemens, sections of Sterling Heights, and portions of Clinton Township.

Prior to assuming her role in the House, Rep. Mentzer amassed a decade of experience on the Mount Clemens City Commission. This extensive background positions her as an outstanding legislator well-versed in the intricacies of budgets, taxes, and enterprise funds. Notably, she has honed the invaluable skill of discerning when to compromise and when to stand firm. Rep. Mentzer consistently upholds her personal values, including a commitment to productivity, transparency, and preparedness—qualities she successfully brought to the City Commission.

Juggling a full-time job, Rep. Mentzer exhibited her dedication by attending night classes to earn a bachelor's degree in business administration from Baker College. A devoted community member, she actively supports and motivates those around her. Rep. Mentzer proudly continues her family's tradition of public service, with her father having served as a detective lieutenant in the Macomb County Sheriff’s Department for 34 years before retiring. Beyond her legislative role, she has contributed to various community organizations, holding positions such as vice president of the Mount Clemens Optimist Club, member of the Mount Clemens Public Library Board of Friends, officer with the Macomb County Democratic Committee, and member of the Clinton Township Democratic Club. Her dedicated service has been recognized with a certificate of appreciation from Amvets Post 29.

Rep. Mentzer's deep-rooted pride and passion for her community are evident in her consistent commitment to instigate positive change and take a leadership role. In her legislative capacity, she advocates for affordable and accessible healthcare, the creation of new educational opportunities for children and families, the enhancement of the ever-evolving economy, and the improvement of Michigan's water infrastructure.
