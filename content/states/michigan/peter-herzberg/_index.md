State Rep. Peter Herzberg was elected to serve the remaining term of the 102nd Legislature and is now serving his first full term representing the 25th House District, which encompasses all of Wayne and portions of Canton, Dearborn Heights and Westland. He graduated from John Glenn High School and received a bachelor’s degree in finance from Wayne State University.

Herzberg grew up in Westland, near Warren Road and Wayne and has lived in the same neighborhood for his entire life, with his fiancé and daughter. He loves his community and has served in various community organizations, such as the Westland Festival Committee and the Westland Veterans Association. His strong commitment to his community has led him to help raise funds for Alzheimer’s research, juvenile diabetes research, and the Westland Veterans Memorial Garden and Camp Liberty. 

This love for his community would eventually lead Herzberg to spend his entire adult life focusing on public service, volunteering and helping his community. He attended Westland City Council meetings for over 13 years, and served on the city council for nine of those years, becoming the longest serving city council member. While serving as a council member, Herzberg had success passing resolutions to promote small businesses, expand voting access and better protect and care for seniors.

Herzberg is committed to securing adequate funding for Michigan’s schools, protecting the freedom of people to make their own reproductive health decisions and advocating for the hard working people of the 25th House District.
