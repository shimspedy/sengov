Rep. Scott is a former organizer and longtime labor and social justice community activist. She was previously appointed to serve on the House Democrats’ Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Planning Committee and the House Committee on Committees. Scott graduated from Marygrove College with a bachelor’s degree in psychology and political science.

As the lead organizer for Southeast Michigan Jobs with Justice, she spearheaded a petition drive to gather over 5,000 signatures for the One Fair Wage ballot proposal initiative. More recently, she served on the Steering Committee to Protect and Defend One Fair Wage. Her sister-in-law, former Detroit City Council Pro Temp Brenda Scott, fostered her passion for service. Scott’s commitment to the community led her to volunteer and serve on many boards and organizations. Formerly, she was an executive board member for the Coalition of Labor Union Women, the Detroit League of Women Voters, vice chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus and vice chair of the 14th Congressional District and was recently elected to serve as the vice chair of the Detroit Legislative Caucus. Additionally, she serves as the chair of the bicameral Legislative Care Caucus, and the historian of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus. She also serves on the board of Detroit Horse Power. Before joining the Legislature, Scott worked in the airline industry for over 20 years as a sales and service instructor. She also worked for her predecessor, former Rep. LaTanya Garrett, as her community liaison. She has two young adult children, Rick and Samantha Scott.
