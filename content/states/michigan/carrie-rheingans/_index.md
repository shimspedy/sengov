State Representative Carrie Rheingans is currently in her first term, representing the diverse 47th House District. This district includes portions of Jackson County and Washtenaw County, encompassing Columbia Township, Napoleon Township, Norvell Township, Dexter city, Freedom Township, Lima Township, Manchester Township, Scio Township, Sharon Township, and parts of Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor Township, Grass Lake Township, and Summit Township.

Rep. Rheingans holds a unique perspective, viewing every policy issue as fundamentally connected to health. She believes that community and individual well-being hinge on essential aspects of daily life, such as community safety, economic prosperity, meaningful relationships, affordable food, the built and natural environment, high-speed internet access, and a functional government with effective services. Her career and passion have revolved around advancing health equity, with a specific focus on uplifting marginalized groups, including Black, Indigenous, people of color, rural communities, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Rep. Rheingans aims to amplify the voices of her neighbors across the 47th District, valuing their ideas for solutions rooted in their lived experiences.

A Michigan native with deep roots in the state, Rep. Rheingans grew up in one of Michiganâ€™s rural towns, and her great-grandfather served as the minister at the Brooklyn Presbyterian Church in Jackson County for five years. She is a three-time alumna of the University of Michigan, holding a bachelor of science, master of public health, and master of social work. Prior to her election to office, she worked as a project director for the Michigan Public Health Institute and served as a lecturer at the U of M School of Social Work. Residing in western Ann Arbor with her husband and 5-year-old daughter, Rep. Rheingans is deeply committed to her community.

In addition to her legislative role, Rep. Rheingans is actively engaged in various community organizations. She serves on the Washtenaw County Board of Health, the Washtenaw Emergency Medical Services Commission, and holds the position of vice chair of programming for the Ann Arbor Democratic Club. She is also a proud member of the American Federation of Teachers Local 6244.
