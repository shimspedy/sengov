HISTORY
Sen. Michael Webber was elected to the Michigan state Senate in 2022 to represent the residents of the 9th District, which includes the cities of Rochester, Rochester Hills, Troy, and Utica along with parts of Oakland Township, Shelby Township and Sterling Heights.

A resident of the district for over 30 years, Webber is a licensed insurance agent and graduate of Rochester Adams High School. He earned his bachelor’s degree in international relations from Michigan State University’s James Madison College.

PUBLIC SERVICE
From 2015 to 2020, Webber served in the state House of Representatives, elected by the residents of the greater Rochester area to serve the 45th District. During that time, he served as chair of the House Committee on Regulatory Reform and served as a member of several committees including the Energy, Insurance, Tax Policy, and Transportation committees. During his final term in the House, Webber also served as assistant majority floor leader. His Michigan state government experience also includes nearly ten years within the staffs of Gov. John Engler, House Speaker Rick Johnson, state Sen. Nancy Cassis, state Rep. John Proos and state Rep. Marty Knollenberg. His first state government experience was serving as an intern for state Sen. Bill Bullard, Jr. while attending college, an experience that encouraged him to pursue public service.
COMMUNITY
Webber also previously served on the Rochester Hills City Council for seven years (2007-2014), including three as vice president. He currently serves on the boards for Dutton Farm and the Rochester Community Schools Foundation. He is an active member of the Rochester Regional Chamber of Commerce. He also served as the 58th president of the Rochester Area Junior Chamber (Jaycees), where he helped deliver Easter baskets to area seniors, participated in Safety Town, and the Christmas Shopping Tour for disadvantaged children. He was named one of Oakland County’s Elite 40 Under 40 in 2013 and an Outstanding Young Michigander by the Michigan Jaycees in 2014.

FAMILY
Webber and his wife, Julia, live in Rochester Hills with their son, James.
