Senator Sue Shink is a community advocate, public servant, and mother who has dedicated her adult life to building healthier, more resilient communities. She is serving her first term in the Michigan Senate where she is fighting for working families.

Shink believes that government’s role is to serve the people with skill, honesty and integrity. Hailing from a proud union family, she grew up in Southeastern Michigan and earned her bachelor’s, master’s, and law degrees from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

Prior to being elected to the Senate, Shink served as Chair of the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners and as a Northfield Township Trustee. She was also chair of the Agricultural Land Preservation Advisory Committee (ALPAC) and served as a member on the Huron River Watershed Council as well as the Washtenaw County Food Policy Council.

Shink lives in Northfield Township on a small farm with her husband, Tom, where they proudly raised their three daughters.
