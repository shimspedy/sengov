Rep. Matt Hall is serving his third term as state representative from Southwest Michigan. He lives in Richland Township and represents the 42nd House District, which includes portions of Kalamazoo and Allegan counties.

Matt’s colleagues elected him House Republican leader for the 2023-2024 term. Leader Hall and House Republicans are focused on making life more affordable for Michiganders, attracting the high-paying careers of the future, and building stronger and safer communities.

From the time he took office in 2019, Matt has led efforts to make Michigan a better place to live and state government more responsive to the citizens it serves. In his first term, he chaired the House Oversight Committee, where he worked to ensure state government was transparent and accountable to the people. Matt also served as chair of the Joint Select Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic, examining the efficacy of the Whitmer administration’s response to the pandemic and exposing billions of dollars of unemployment fraud. Matt’s leadership on those committees earned him the recognition of Michigan Information & Research Service (MIRS), a leading Capitol news outlet that named him 2020 House Member of the Year.

Matt took on another leadership role in his second term, when his colleagues elected him Republican caucus chair. In 2021, he worked across the aisle to make Michigan more competitive and bring manufacturing back to Michigan, and the new Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve has brought transformational automotive projects to Michigan and secured thousands of quality jobs. The Michigan Manufacturers Association honored Matt’s critical role in this success by naming him Legislator of the Year in 2022.

During his second term, Matt also presided over the House Tax Policy Committee, advancing numerous bipartisan efforts to provide much-needed relief to Michigan workers, families, and seniors. He successfully negotiated bipartisan tax cuts that are saving Michigan small businesses hundreds of millions of dollars each year. In 2022, the National Federation of Independent Business recognized him as a Guardian of Small Business.

After graduating with honors from Western Michigan University’s Haworth College of Business, Matt earned his Juris Doctor from WMU-Cooley Law School.

Matt is a constitutional law attorney, and he served as the West Michigan liaison for the Michigan Department of Attorney General. Previously, he had worked in the private sector for a combat vehicle propulsion manufacturer.
