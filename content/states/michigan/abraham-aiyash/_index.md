Abraham Aiyash, Majority Floor Leader and Michigan House Representative, is currently in his second term, representing House District 9. Born to Yemeni immigrants and raised in a working-class family in Hamtramck, Aiyash is deeply committed to championing progressive solutions and justice within his community.

Aiyash's involvement in political activism dates back to his early days as a community organizer for President Obama's historic 2008 campaign. Growing up in a household where his father was a UAW member and his mother a homemaker, Aiyash gained a firsthand understanding of the challenges faced by working-class families. As a representative, he directs his efforts towards addressing these issues in House District 9, encompassing his hometown of Hamtramck and the surrounding areas of Detroit.

Aiyash holds a bachelor's degree in political theory and constitutional democracy from Michigan State University. During his time there, he co-founded a nonprofit dedicated to mentoring refugee children in the Lansing area, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to community service and empowerment.

His venture into legislative work began under the guidance of state Rep. Rose Mary Robinson. Actively involved in community resistance against a corporation's attempt to expand a toxic waste site on the Hamtramck-Detroit border, Aiyash solidified his dedication to environmental justice. This commitment led him to organize against corporate polluters and initiate a recycling program within his local school district.

Aiyash's political journey is intricately linked with his background in community organizing. As the statewide training and political leadership director at Michigan United, he played a pivotal role in training political leaders and advocating for progressive solutions in areas such as education, healthcare, immigration, criminal justice, and environmental justice.

A strong advocate for grassroots movements, Aiyash seeks to redefine the role of elected officials. He passionately supports state-level solutions addressing social and health disparities in impoverished and working-class communities. His legislative approach mirrors his dedication to embodying the values and voices of the communities he represents. Through collaborative efforts with community activists, Aiyash strives to ensure that the formulation of state policies is genuinely inclusive and representative of the diverse perspectives within his constituency.
