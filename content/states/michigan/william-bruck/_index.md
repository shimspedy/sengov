District

Rep. William Bruck was first elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in November 2022. He represents the 30th House District, which includes Deerfield and Ridgeway townships and part of Blissfield Township in Lenawee County, as well as part of Monroe County: the cities of Luna Pier and Petersburg, part of the city of Monroe, the townships of Bedford, Erie, Ida, La Salle, Monroe, Summerfield, and Whiteford, and part of Frenchtown Township.

Committees

Will serves on the House committees on Higher Education; Insurance and Financial Services; and Transportation, Mobility, and Infrastructure.

Military service

A decorated combat veteran, Will has served in the U.S. Army for more than 30 years, earning the rank of Chief Warrant Officer 4. Since enlisting in 1992, he has deployed overseas on four tours of duty, serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. He has received numerous awards, including two Bronze Star Medals, the Meritorious Service Medal and a Combat Action Badge.

Professional

Will has worked as an I.B.E.W. Journeyman Lineman since 2000, servicing electrical grids in Southeast Michigan and nearby Ohio. In late 2013, he entered the home care business, and is the owner of the local Visiting Angels offices in both Monroe, Michigan, and Toledo, Ohio.

Education

Will graduated from Northland Baptist Bible College in 1998 with a bachelor’s degree in Biblical studies. He then earned his journeyman lineman card through the American Line Builders Apprenticeship Training program. Later, Will studied at Columbia Southern University, earning a Master of Business Administration in 2014.

Personal

Will is a lifelong Monroe County resident. He and his wife, Natalie, have nine children and reside on a hobby farm in Erie. The Bruck family worships at Carleton Community Baptist Church.

Community service is very important to Will – be it for the veteran community, the small-business community, or the Monroe County community as a whole. He is involved with the Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Little Blessings Veterans and Community Outreach and Rotary Club. As a small-business owner, he has been a member of the Monroe County Chamber of Commerce, and in addition to his home care business, he has served local senior citizens through the Monroe Aging Consortium, where he has been a member of the board. Prior to his election to the House, Will also served six years on the Monroe County Community College Board of Trustees.
