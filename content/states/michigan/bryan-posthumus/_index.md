Elected in 2020, Representative Posthumus serves the citizens of Michigan’s 90th House District, which encompasses much of Northeast Kent County. The district is comprised of the townships of Sparta, Alpine, Algoma, Courtland, Cannon, Grattan, Vergennes and parts of Tyrone and Plainfield, as well as the City of Rockford.

Committees

Rep. Posthumus serves as the Republican vice chair of the House Government Operations Committee. He also sits on the House Fiscal Governing Committee.

Education

Bryan graduated from Michigan State University with a Bachelors’ Degree in Agricultural Business Management.

Profession

As a fifth-generation farmer, Bryan knows the value of hard work and commitment. Over the past ten years, he has built his farm from a start up to the largest farmer-owned hop grower in the state, and he brings that work ethic and experience to Lansing as a representative.

Legislative Accomplishments

From a young age, Bryan understood the importance and challenges of public service. As the son of former Lt. Governor Dick Posthumus, and brother of former State Rep. Lisa Posthumus-Lyons, he had ample opportunity to observe hard-working elected officials.

Whether he is working to defend parent’s choice in their kids’ education or cutting red tape for farmers and job providers with powerful personal testimony, Bryan is a leading voice for West Michigan and the state.

Republican lawmakers selected Bryan to serve as Republican floor leader for the 2023-2024 legislative term. In this role he acts as a primary strategist for the caucus.

Personal

Bryan and his wife, Elizabeth, are raising their family in Cannon Township. He worships at Ada Bible church.
