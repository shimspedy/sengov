State Rep. Kimberly Edwards is serving her first term representing the 12th District, which covers parts of Macomb and Wayne counties, crossing Eight Mile Road and extending south into Detroit. Rep. Edwards’ priorities include defending reproductive freedom, protecting the environment and providing a quality education to every Michigan student.

Rep. Edwards was born and raised on the west side of Detroit but has lived in Eastpointe for a decade. She’s spent most of her life as a dedicated social worker. Her deep connections to her community have given her insight into the policy successes and failures that shape Michiganders’ lives. As a social worker and mother of four, she continues to fight for policies that work for Michigan families. She carries this experience with her, as she advocates for Michiganders via community-centered legislation.
