The daughter of a former mayor, military service member, and the founder of a local community foundation, Senator Rosemary Bayer understands the value of hard work, integrity and community service. She is serving her second term in the Michigan Senate, where she is working hard to pass commonsense firearm safety legislation that could help to save lives.

In addition to her role as State Senator, Bayer serves on the board of directors for NEW, Solutions for Nonprofits and the SheHive, a womenâ€™s collective offering programs to empower women. She also cofounded the Michigan Council of Women in Technology, a nonprofit that provides STEM support for girls and women around Michigan, as well as educational programs.

Before her election to the Michigan Senate, Bayer had a successful career in information technology, first as a computer engineer and analyst who found and invented products to solve complex challenges in business. She lives in West Bloomfield with her husband, John.
