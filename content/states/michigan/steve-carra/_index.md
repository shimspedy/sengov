Steve Carra, State Representative for District 36, has been a lifelong defender of liberty and freedom. Born and raised in Southwest Michigan, Carra would go on to attend Portage High School and then graduate from Western Michigan University with a degree in economics and political science. Following his time as a WMU Bronco, Carra would become a research associate at the Action Institute, a Christian organization that promotes the ideals of free markets to entrepreneurs, students, and educators.

Carraâ€™s experience at the Action Institute allowed him to move into a position as a staffer for State Representative Steve Johnson, where he would serve for three years. With the knowledge gained from working in state politics, Carra would answer the call to service and run for the state representative opening for District 59 in 2020. Since his election victory, Representative Carra has fought for the rights of the residents of Cass and St. Joseph County.

Committees:

In the 2021-2022 legislative session, Rep. Carra served as vice chair of the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR), a bi-cameral, statutory panel of the Legislature. The committee is responsible for legislative oversight of administrative rules proposed or adopted by state agencies. Additionally, Rep. Carra served as a member of the Transportation Committee; Agriculture Committee; and Financial Services Committee.
