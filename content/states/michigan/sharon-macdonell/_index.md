State Representative Sharon MacDonell is currently serving her inaugural term in Michigan's 56th House District, covering segments of Birmingham, Bloomfield Township, Clawson, Royal Oak, and Troy. A Troy resident for nearly 30 years, she resides with her husband and two daughters. Notably, she co-founded Troy Indivisible, served as a precinct delegate for a decade, and held leadership positions as the co-chair and chairperson of the Troy Democratic Club. In her capacity as a dedicated community activist in Troy, she spearheaded initiatives to safeguard the Troy Public Library, address concerns with an ineffective mayor through a recall, and expose corruption within the city management.

Rep. MacDonell is a proud alumna of the University of Michigan, where she earned a bachelor of arts degree in history. Her professional journey has seen her contribute to various broadcasting and automotive firms, holding diverse roles in journalism, marketing, and video production. Notably, she served as the marketing and video manager at Lawrence Technological University when she achieved her electoral victory.

In her role as a legislator, MacDonell focuses on key priorities, including advocating for the funding and support of public education, safeguarding voter rights, combating discrimination, enhancing access to healthcare, and continually reinforcing Michigan's infrastructure, economy, and green initiatives.
