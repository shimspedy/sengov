State Representative Stephen Wooden believes we are strongest when we look out for one another and remember we’re bound by common hopes. He is serving his first term representing the 81st House District, which includes northeast Grand Rapids City, Ada Township, most of Grand Rapids Township and southern Plainfield Township.

Prior to serving in the Legislature, he served as a Kent County Commissioner from 2019 to 2024. For six years, he worked with both sides of the aisle to protect children from lead poisoning, expand emergency mental health services and improve high-speed internet access for rural communities. Most notably, Stephen secured $17.5 million in federal relief money to establish the Kent County Affordable Housing Revolving Loan fund. This public-private partnership has now grown to $58.3 million – the largest of its kind in West Michigan.

Like most, Wooden has felt the impact of rising costs. Whether baby formula, groceries or buying a new home, Rep. Wooden knows how higher costs add stress to any household. He worked for nearly a decade in the non-profit sector helping people save on their monthly bills. Most notably, he worked for seven years for Dwelling Place of Grand Rapids, one of the region’s largest community economic development organizations. He’s personally helped develop or renovate nearly 1,000 residences that everyday folks can afford.

As he joins the Legislature, he is committed to finding solutions that will bring down the cost of essentials like housing, child care and prescription drugs.

Wooden is a graduate of Grand Rapids Catholic Central High School and Michigan State University. He’s an Eagle Scout from Troop 271. He lives in the Creston Neighborhood with his wife, Adelyn, and their son, Sam. They spend their time going to Riverside Park, reading storybooks, playing around the house and trying to get Sam to bed on time.
