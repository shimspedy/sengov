State Rep. Julie M. Rogers was re-elected to her second term, now representing the 41st House District, which includes  portions of the city of Kalamazoo, city of Portage, and Kalamazoo and Comstock townships. She is a practicing physical therapist and served on the Kalamazoo County Board of Commissioners for eight years and served as board chair. This term, she was appointed to serve as chair of House Committee on Health Policy and as a member of the House Committee on Insurance and Financial Services; House Committee on Military, Veterans and Homeland Security; House Appropriations Committee and House Committee on Local Government and Municipal Finance. Rogers also chairs the Biosciences Legislative Caucus and is the co-chair of the Arts and Culture Legislative Caucus.

Rep. Rogers grew up in Kalamazoo County and is a proud graduate of public schools. She later attended Marquette University and earned a master’s degree in physical therapy. Her 23-year career as a physical therapist has led her to become a champion of public health, serving on the National Association of Counties Health Steering Committee for seven years. Rogers’ experience as a physical therapist inspired her to advocate for auto no-fault reform, after seeing the devastating effects that forced catastrophic car accident survivors to lose their long-term care. She has been recognized for her work with a nomination to the Class of 2019 Women in Government, a national nonpartisan leadership program for women elected officials of all levels of government. Rogers lives in Kalamazoo with her husband, Dr. Ed Orloff, DPT where they enjoy participating in community runs and triathlons. Her past service includes: Girls on the Run coach, West Michigan Cancer Center Board, Hospital Hospitality House Board, Ascension Borgess Diversity Council, Bronson Hospital Patient & Family Advisory Council, Junior League of Kalamazoo member, and team leader for Adopt-A-Highway cleanup program.
