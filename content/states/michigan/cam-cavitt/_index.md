Rep. Cam Cavitt was first elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in November 2022. He represents the 106th District, which includes the Northern Michigan counties of Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency, Presque Isle, and portions of both Oscoda and Cheboygan.

Committees

Cam serves on the influential House Appropriations Committee, which handles the state budget. He also serves as the Republican vice chair on the Military and Veterans Affairs and State Police Appropriations subcommittee and as a member on the Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), and Judiciary Appropriations subcommittees.

Education

Cam received his associate degree from KVCC then attended Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo.

Professional

Cam has been a northern Michigan realtor for nearly two decades. He also runs a small business and serves his community as Cheboygan County Drain Commissioner, while working various local “odd jobs”, from working on Christmas tree farms, to working in hospitality. In 2020, Cam was elected as a delegate to the Republican National Convention and was proudly endorsed by then-President Trump’s campaign, and Congressman Jack Bergman.

Personal

Cavitt and his wife, Lynn, have lived in Northeast Michigan for decades. There, they raised their three kids: Caleb, Skyler and Emma. Cam is an outdoorsman, and works every day to ensure Michigan’s land and water remain the greatest place to work, play, and raise a family. Cam believes our rights come from God – not the government.
