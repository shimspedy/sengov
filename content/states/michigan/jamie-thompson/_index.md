Working for you

Jamie is a fierce fighter for freedom, prosperity and hope and will work to defend families, communities and small businesses for a better tomorrow.

She understands Downriver communities are diverse areas that represent different backgrounds. The region features working families, single-parent households, veterans, retirees and many small-business owners who all look to their elected officials to work on their behalf and provide effective, accountable leadership every day.

Jamie will pursue legislation that works to hold state government accountable to the people it represents, provide more transparency and communication to parents regarding their child’s education, and diversify Michigan’s workforce so that the state and region can be a leader for the good-paying jobs of today and tomorrow. She will also fight for local infrastructure projects that improve roads and bridges from driveway to highway across Downriver communities.

Education

After majoring in nursing at Wayne County Community College, Jamie received her Nursing License through the Detroit Business Institute in Riverview in 2012. In the same year, she became a Licensed Practical Nurse through the state.

Professional

Jamie is a Licensed Practical Nurse specializing in wound care, administrative nursing, long-term acute care and sub-acute care. She also serves as a doula – a professional labor assistant who provides physical and emotional support during pregnancy and childbirth – and conducts breastfeeding education for new mothers.

Personal

Jamie is a life-long Christian and a mother of three and grandmother of three. Family is incredibly important to Jamie. She and her husband are legal guardians to their three grandchildren after they tragically lost their 24-year-old daughter in a motorcycle accident in 2021.

Jamie is proud of her Native American heritage. She is a member of the Mississaugas of Hiawatha First Nation and has legal standing. The Michisaagiig of Rice Lake in Ontario has been recognized for over 200 years.

She is a member of Phi Theta Kappa and received the Soroptomist Women’s Achievement Award in 2012. The program is a unique education award for women who provide primary financial support for their families.
