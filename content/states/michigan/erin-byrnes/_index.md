State Rep. Erin Byrnes is serving her second term representing House District 15, which comprises the west end of Dearborn and Dearborn Heights. Her priorities include ethics and transparency, protecting the right to vote, defending reproductive rights, supporting education and advancing pay equity.

Having grown up in Dearborn as the daughter of a DPW employee and a health care worker, Rep. Byrnes has a deep appreciation of the rewards of hard work and the importance of unions to sustaining the middle class. Rep. Byrnes earned a Bachelor’s degree in Women’s and Gender Studies from the University of Michigan-Dearborn and went on to graduate school in New York City, where she served as a middle school special education teacher and obtained a Master of Science in Education by taking classes in the evening. After returning home to be close to family and serve her community, Rep. Byrnes continued her work as an educator at the University of Michigan and completed the Michigan Political Leadership Program at Michigan State University in 2015.

Rep. Byrnes served as a member of the Dearborn City Council from 2018-2023. During her tenure, she worked to beautify neighborhoods, revitalize business districts, get the COVID-19 vaccine to homebound seniors, pass a first-of-its-kind air quality ordinance and approve economic development projects. She is proud to represent the residents of House District 15 and is focused on delivering tangible outcomes for the people of Michigan.
