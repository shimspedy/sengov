Representative Mike Mueller has been a dedicated member of the Michigan House of Representatives since 2019, proudly representing the 72nd District. This district encompasses Fenton, Fenton Township, Linden, and portions of Grand Blanc and Mundy townships in Genesee County. Additionally, it includes the village of Holly and the townships of Holly and Rose in Oakland County, as well as Tyrone Township in Livingston County.

In the realm of legislative responsibilities, Mike holds the position of Republican vice chair on the House Regulatory Reform committee. Furthermore, he actively participates as a member of the Criminal Justice, Health Policy, and Labor committees.

Mike's extensive service includes chairing the House Committee on Government Operations and serving as vice-chair of the Judiciary Committee. In earlier roles, he contributed to the Health Policy and Regulatory Reform committees.

Education has been a cornerstone of Mike's journey. A 1992 graduate of Linden High School, he briefly pursued Junior "A" Hockey before enlisting in the United States Navy. Following an honorable discharge, Mike attended Eastern Michigan University, earning a degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice while captaining the university's hockey team. His dedication to law enforcement led him to the Washtenaw County Community College Police Academy, where he graduated in 1999 as the class vice president, receiving the "Outstanding Performance Award" from the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards.

Professionally, Mike served the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office from 2000 to 2005, excelling as a road patrol deputy and a SWAT Team member. His commitment extended to assisting Hurricane Katrina victims in New Orleans in September 2005. Later, he joined the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office in October 2005, where he served until his retirement in late 2018. In Livingston County, Mike's roles included road patrol deputy, court deputy, and member of the Tactical Team, earning him numerous letters of commendation and awards, including the prestigious title of 2016 Field Services Deputy of the Year.

On a personal note, Mike shares his life with his wife Angela and their three sons and one daughter. Residing in Linden, they oversee Mueller’s Orchard and Cider Mill, a family-owned establishment since 1941. Additionally, they manage a wedding venue on the property.
