State Rep. Kevin Coleman is serving his third term representing the city of Wayne and the majority of the city of Westland with this being his first in the newly created 25th House District. Also included in the new 25th House District are portions of Canton and Dearborn Heights. He is a graduate of Western Michigan University, attended the Lee Honors College and is a former member of the Westland City Council.

While on the Westland City Council, Coleman fought to provide additional resources and increase the number of much-needed public safety personnel in both the police and fire departments and increase government transparency. Coleman is dedicated to making sure that government is providing the best service possible to the public and holding public officials to a high standard of ethics.

Prior to seeking public office, Coleman spent several years working in the community on the Westland Festival Committee and the Westland Veterans Association. As a state representative, he looks forward to continuing his work on public safety, criminal justice reform and government transparency.
