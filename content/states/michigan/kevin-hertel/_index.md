Kevin Hertel is serving his first term in the Michigan Senate.

During his time in the Michigan House of Representatives from 2016-2022, he fought to maintain Michigan’s prevailing wage law which ensures that those who work on state-funded projects are paid fairly, and he continues to advocate for ending the gender wage gap.

Hertel is also a strong believer in the importance and transformative power of public education and continues to advocate for historic investments in students, setting the next generation up for expanded educational opportunities. He is equally committed to public safety, which is why he fought on a bipartisan basis to keep Michigan’s children safe from abuse and neglect.

He lives in St. Clair Shores with his wife, Ann, and their two children.
