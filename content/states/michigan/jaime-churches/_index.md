State Rep. Jaime Churches is serving her first term representing the 27th House District, which encompasses parts of Wayne County, including Gibraltar, Grosse Ile Township, Riverview, Southgate, Trenton and Wyandotte.

Churches is a longtime resident of Downriver. She attended Madonna University and earned her bachelor’s in integrated science and elementary education and her master’s in educational leadership. She has been teaching fifth grade for the past 10 years, serving in Gibraltar, Woodhaven-Brownstown and Grosse Ile Township school districts.

Churches is passionate about serving her community and state. As a former educator and union vice president, she has seen how the lack of investment in public education, small business and working families has led to hardships and inequity for Michiganders. Policy priorities for Churches include education, labor and infrastructure. Churches uses her skills and experience as an educator, organizer and advocate to promote lasting, positive changes that meet the needs of her community and the state of Michigan.

Churches lives in Wyandotte and enjoys spending time with family and friends, walking her rescue dog, Buck, and traveling.
