Committees

Matthew serves as Republican vice chair on the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR). He is also a member on the House Agriculture Committee and Regulatory Reform Committee.

Working for you

As a Tuscola County native, Matthew has continued to serve the area and worked tirelessly so families and communities in the region can thrive. As a state representative, he is committed to keeping the area growing for families and hard-working taxpayers – while working to cut burdensome red tape and heavy-handed approaches from state government that have impacted small businesses, workers and families.

Education

Matthew is a graduate of Vassar High School and Delta College. In 2013, he earned a bachelor’s degree in organizational management from Spring Arbor University.

Professional

Prior to being elected to the Michigan House of Representatives, Matthew had a career in the manufacturing industry, working as a machine operator, purchasing manager, engineering technician, and production manager.

From 2019 to 2022, Matthew served as the in-district director for Sen. Kevin Daley, working closely with local families, businesses, and service groups. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he helped meet the needs of people in the community who were struggling due to the economic shut down.

Matthew served as a Tuscola County commissioner from 2013 to 2019, acting as vice-chair of the board and co-chair of the finance committee. During this time, he also served as president of the Michigan Association of Counties and on the board of directors for the National Association of County Officers.

Personal

Matthew and his wife Dr. Mindy Bierlein, a physical therapist, have been married since 2010. They live in Vassar with their three children, Matthew James, Madison and Maddox. Together, they own and operate a physical therapy practice with clinics in Frankenmuth and Bridgeport.

The Bierlein family enjoys spending time together outside in the garden or the woods around their homestead. They have a dog named Blaze and enjoy raising livestock.
