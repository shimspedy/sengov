HISTORY
Sen. Aric Nesbitt grew up as the middle child on a six-generation family farm in West Michigan. He went on to earn an economics degree from Hillsdale College, later earning a master’s in international business. He received the “Distinguished Alumnus” award from Hillsdale for his work as a conservative reformer.
PUBLIC SERVICE
In 2010, Nesbitt was elected to represent Van Buren County and part of Allegan County in the Michigan House of Representatives. He served three terms in the state House, achieving results for hardworking taxpayers by balancing budgets and reducing debt, lowering the tax burden, eliminating thousands of regulations, and defending our West Michigan values. Nesbitt served as the House Majority Floor Leader and chair of the House Committee on Energy and Technology. He also served as a member of Gov. Rick Snyder’s cabinet, managing an agency that generates nearly $1 billion annually for public education. In 2018, Nesbitt was first elected to the state Senate. He now represents the 20th District, which includes portions of Berrien, Van Buren, Allegan and Kent counties. He passed into law Senate Bill 1, which significantly lowered auto insurance rates by providing drivers choices, stopping price gouging, and cracking down on fraud and lawsuit abuse. Additionally, the senator successfully led the charge to stop Governor Whitmer’s massive tax increases on drivers and small businesses. Nesbitt currently serves as Senate Republican Leader.

COMMUNITY
As a sportsman, Nesbitt is a member of the National Rifle Association, Ducks Unlimited and South Haven Steelheaders. He will continue to support efforts to prevent Asian Carp from entering our Great Lakes. Nesbitt is also the son of a Vietnam War veteran, and is a strong supporter of our nation’s veterans.

FAMILY
The senator currently lives in Porter Township, with his wife Trisha, daughter Catherine, and son William near the family farm.
