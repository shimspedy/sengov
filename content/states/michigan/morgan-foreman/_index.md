State Rep. Morgan Foreman has worked hard to earn her spot at the Capitol. With a modest upbringing, she never thought her journey would lead her here. Foreman was born in Southeast Michigan, where she was raised by her grandparents, both UAW members. Foreman’s dedication and grit helped her rise through the ranks in her community as a steadfast leader.

Foreman has spent decades advocating for Washtenaw County. Before her election, she worked closely with former state Rep. Felicia Brabec — when her mentor decided not to run for re-election, Foreman knew it was her time. She brings a wide variety of experience in community leadership to her role, having previously served on the Washtenaw County Brownfield Development Board, the Washtenaw County Democratic Party County Committee, as treasurer of Washtenaw County Democratic Party Black Caucus, and as an elected precinct delegate in Washtenaw County. Foreman’s leadership doesn’t end there — she also graduated from the Michigan Educational Policy Fellowship Program in 2022 and graduated from the Michigan Political Leadership Program. In 2019, she was named a NEW Leader of Color Fellow.

Foreman serves her community attentively, placing their needs at the forefront of her priorities. Her policy priorities include:

Education
Consumer Protection
Supporting Seniors
Safeguarding Fundamental Rights
Rep. Foreman will continue to work for Michiganders well-being and the state’s successful future. With her past experience, she is always ready to hit the ground running.
