State Representative Jasper R. Martus is currently in his inaugural term, representing the 69th House District, which encompasses his hometown of Flushing, Flushing Township, Clayton Township, Clio, Flint Township, Mount Morris, Mount Morris Township, Swartz Creek, Montrose, and portions of Montrose Township and Vienna Township.

Martus's early involvement in community service began with his work for Congressman Dan Kildee, providing him with firsthand experience in the importance of having a dedicated advocate for the community. A graduate of Michigan State University's James Madison College, Martus holds a degree in international relations with a minor in world religions. His collegiate years were marked by work for various state representatives, and after graduation, he served as a full-time communications advisor for the Michigan House Democrats.

Martus is deeply committed to representing the people he serves, influenced by the values instilled by his family and faith. He draws inspiration from the hardworking individuals in his community. His key priorities include job creation to foster economic growth, infrastructure improvement for reliable travel, and advocacy for a robust education system that prepares Genesee County's youth for success in the modern economy.

In House leadership, Martus holds the position of vice chair of the Democratic Caucus, playing a crucial role in building consensus among colleagues on legislative priorities. His committee assignments underscore his dedication to ensuring Genesee County's interests are well-represented. These assignments include the Appropriations Committee; vice chair of the Health and Human Services Subcommittee; vice chair of the Labor and Economic Opportunity Subcommittee; vice chair of the Agriculture and Natural Resources Subcommittee; member of the Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy Subcommittee; and member of the Licensing and Regulatory Affairs and Insurance and Financial Services Subcommittee.
