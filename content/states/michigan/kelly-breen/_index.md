State Rep. Kelly Breen is serving her first term representing the 38th House District, which encompasses the cities of Novi, Walled Lake, South Lyon and part of Northville. Breen is a lifelong Michigander born in Northville. She has served many roles including attorney, activist, former Novi City Council Member and proud mother of two.

Breen earned a bachelor’s degree from Michigan State University James Madison School and a J.D. from Wayne State University Law School.

Breen’s advocacy was fostered when she joined her neighbors to push back against an irresponsible local development project. That first taste of neighborhood activism led her to focus her time on supporting her community. Breen’s advocacy and determination led her to her first elected office to the Novi City Council in 2017.

She is committed to collaborate and serve the true intent of public service—working to make each other’s lives better.
