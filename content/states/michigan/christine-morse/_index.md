State Rep. Christine Morse is serving her second term representing the redistricted 40th House District, which comprises parts of the city of Portage and Kalamazoo and parts of the Townships of Oshtemo and Texas. Rep. Morse is a former Kalamazoo County commissioner, attorney, cancer survivor and mom of three.

Morse graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in political science/pre-law. During her time in Lansing, she interned with Lt. Gov. Connie Binsfeld. She continued her education at Wayne State University Law School, from which she graduated in 1998. She has practiced law in both Michigan and California.

For 11 years, she and her family traveled the country and world while her husband served in the U.S. Navy. In 2010, Morse and her family settled in Kalamazoo, where she has survived breast cancer, raised her children and has been an active community volunteer.

Seeing a need for transparent and accessible leadership in her community, Morse ran for the Kalamazoo County Board of Commissioners in 2018. She served on the county commission from 2018-19. Local governing experience highlighted the need for true representation at the state level, so Morse ran to be a leader who listens to her community. She is committed to increasing investments in public education, ensuring access to health care with an emphasis on mental health, and protecting Michiganâ€™s water and environment.
