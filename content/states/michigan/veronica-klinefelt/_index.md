Senator Veronica Klinefelt, a proud Army brat and 30-year resident of Macomb County, believes there is nothing more patriotic than serving one’s community. Her passion is good government: that which keeps sewage out of our lakes, helps us retain great teachers, supports our firefighters and police officers, and funds our parks and community centers. She is serving her first term in the Michigan Senate.

As a mom, Klinefelt decided to run for a seat on her local school board in 1998 when she saw her children’s education being shortchanged. After quickly realizing the underfunding of our schools was only the tip of the iceberg, she ran for, and won, a seat on Eastpointe City Council, a position she held for eight years. She then served for 10 years on the Macomb County Board of Commissioners, where she fought for a strong community mental health system, a veterans’ services department, and an updated 9-1-1 system.

Klinefelt has also served on the 8 ½ Mile Drain Board, as President of the Michigan Association of Counties, and as one of two representatives on the National Association of Counties Board of Directors.
