Tim Kelly, born on December 21, 1956, in Indiana, is an American politician currently serving as a member of the Michigan House of Representatives from the 93rd district. He assumed office on January 1, 2025, succeeding Graham Filler. Kelly previously served in the Michigan House of Representatives from the 94th district from January 1, 2013, to January 1, 2019, where he succeeded Ken Horn and was succeeded by Rodney Wakeman.

Kelly's political career began at the local level, where he was a member of the Saginaw County Board of Commissioners and chairman of the Saginaw County Republican Party. His district consists of part of Saginaw County. In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Kelly to serve as the Assistant Secretary of Education for Career and Technical Education. However, the administration withdrew the nomination due to Kelly's controversial statements about women, Muslims, and impoverished parents.

In 2020, Kelly announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives seat representing Michigan's 5th congressional district. He won the Republican primary on August 4, 2020, defeating Earl Lackie. However, he was defeated by incumbent Dan Kildee in the general election on November 3, 2020.

Kelly holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Denver. He is married to Deenie. Throughout his career, Kelly has been involved in various legislative committees, including Appropriations, Education Reform, Commerce, Financial Services, Oversight, Regulatory Reform, and Tax Policy. His legislative work has focused on education, economic development, and regulatory reform.

Kelly's political journey has been marked by both achievements and controversies. Despite setbacks, he has remained a prominent figure in Michigan politics, continuing to advocate for his constituents and the values he believes in.
