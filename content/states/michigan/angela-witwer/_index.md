State Rep. Angela Witwer is serving her third term representing the 76th House District, which includes much of Eaton County; the cities of Charlotte, Olivet, Potterville, and Eaton Rapids; parts of Lansing and Grand Ledge; and the townships of Brookfield, Benton, Carmel, Chester, Delta Charter, Eaton Rapids, Hamlin, Oneida Charter, Vermontville, Walton, and Windsor Charter. She serves as chair of the House Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for setting expenditures for the state of Michigan, including making decisions on the state’s annual and supplemental budgets throughout the fiscal year.

An alumna of Waverly Community Schools, Witwer went on to receive her bachelor’s degree in business and marketing from Northwood University. Witwer began her professional career in clinical health care, working first in Sparrow Hospital’s burn unit and later as the manager of pediatric rehabilitation. The desire to help others, coupled with her clinical expertise, propelled Witwer to become manager of Sparrow’s community relations and marketing department.

After 22 years working in health care, Witwer left Sparrow in 2007 to co-found Edge Partnerships, an award-winning public relations, marketing and advocacy group. During this time, she was a strong advocate for quality public education and community engagement, serving as the vice president of Waverly Community Schools Board of Education and was an active member of the Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce Economic Club committee, the Wharton Center for Performing Arts Advisory Council, and the McLaren Greater Lansing Foundation Board of Directors.

Witwer lives in Delta Township with her husband, Bruce, and enjoys spending time with her two children and four granddaughters.
