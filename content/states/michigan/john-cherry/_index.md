Senator John Cherry is fighting every day to lower costs for working families, protect our water, and strengthen our infrastructure. He is serving his first term in the Michigan Senate.

A two-term State Representative and the grandson of UAW retirees and generations of outdoorsmen, Cherry values conserving our environment and making sure that Michigan always preserves its wilderness while supporting job growth and smart urban development.

Prior to his service in the Michigan House of Representatives and inspired by friends and family who instilled in him the importance of public service, he served as vice chair of the Flint Charter Commission, which proposed Flint’s first new charter in more than 40 years.

Cherry has a bachelor’s degree in natural resources and environment and a master’s degree in public policy, both from the University of Michigan.  He lives in Flint, with his wife, daughter and infant son.
