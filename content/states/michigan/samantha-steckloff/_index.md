State Representative Samantha Steckloff is serving her second term representing Michigan’s 19th House District, which comprises the communities of Farmington Hills, Birmingham, Beverly Hills, Southfield, Bloomfield Township, Bingham Farms, Franklin and Southfield Township. Rep. Steckloff serves on the Appropriations Committee and five Appropriations subcommittees: General Government, Higher Education and Community Colleges (Chair), Joint Capital Outlay (Majority Vice Chair), School Aid and Education, and Transportation.

As a lifelong resident of Farmington Hills, Rep. Steckloff has been a consistent and tenacious leader on the issues that impact her communities, as well as the state of Michigan as a whole. As a Farmington Hills City Councilmember, she created a Commission on Community Health, the first of its kind in the State of Michigan, authored a Human Rights Ordinance, and worked to expand green energy and sustainable buildings.

Samantha was diagnosed with Breast Cancer at the age of 31 and understands the need to reform health insurance so no person will go broke battling a life-threatening disease.  She understands how difficult it can be to get ahead when you’re trying to pay health insurance, rent, and basic living expenses with wages that have been too low for too long.
