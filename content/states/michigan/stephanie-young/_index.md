After graduating from Cass Technical High School and Michigan State University’s James Madison College, Rep. Young’s first professional job was as a legislative aide to a former State Representative.  Through her work with several former state representatives, numerous mayoral administrations and community advocacy organizations, including the Detroit Area Agency on Aging, Young has put her leadership and relationship building skills to use to improve the lives of her community members at every step.

Prior to her work with the Legislature, Rep. Young served as the first Executive Director of Detroit’s Community Education Commission, where she worked diligently to help improve educational outcomes for Detroit students by eliminating barriers to success and improving access to transportation, quality afterschool programs and information for parents. Young brings outstanding leadership capabilities, compassion and a fresh perspective to her role at the Capitol.

Her oldest received his Bachelor’s in Animation from the University of St. Francis and her youngest received his Bachelor’s in finance at Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business. She is also the proud Mom-owner of her 4-legged adopted ‘son’ who has been part of her family for more than 10 years. Young is also a licensed and ordained minister in the Christian faith and is affectionately known as Elder Steph. She is on the ministerial staff at her home church, Historic Pure Word Missionary Baptist Church, which is in her District.

In her first term, Rep. Young had two bills signed into law, served as the Assistant Democratic Caucus Whip, and she served on the Financial Services Committee, Regulatory Reform Committee and Oversight  Committee. She served on the Executive Committees for the Detroit Caucus, the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus (MLBC), the Legislative Care Caucus, as well as served on the Governor’s Child Welfare Task Force and the House Adoption and Foster Care Task Force.
