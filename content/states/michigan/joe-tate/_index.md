State Representative Joe Tateis serving his fourth term in the House and was Michigan’s first and only Black Speaker of the House. He represents the 9th House District — a diverse area that covers Detroit’s Downtown, Belle Isle, and Eastside communities.

His policy priorities focus on putting people first by making life more affordable, investing in a world-class education system, delivering on better public safety, addressing the housing crisis, and improving the criminal justice system.   

Rep. Tate decided to run for office as a part of his deep and lifelong commitment to public service. The value of service was taught to him by his parents — a teacher in the Detroit public school system and a Detroit firefighter. His life has been shaped by teamwork, commitment, and community.

As a teenager, Tate earned a scholarship to play football at Michigan State University before joining the National Football League. After the NFL, he went on to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps, deploying twice to Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom.

After an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps, he earned both an MBA and a master’s in environmental policy and planning from the University of Michigan. Before joining the Legislature, Tate helped small businesses grow their capacity as a program manager for the Detroit Economic Growth Corp.
