Senator Sean McCann works hard every day to deliver real results for his constituents and residents across the state. Whether it’s protecting our environment or creating new energy jobs, McCann has been at the forefront of progress here in Michigan. He has introduced legislation that would safeguard our water, reform our elections, and protect workers’ wages and health, and is serving his second term in the Michigan Senate.

McCann was drawn to public service as a student at Western Michigan University and spent his first years out of college working to build his community from the ground up as executive director of the Vine Neighborhood Association. While working for Vine, he was elected to the Kalamazoo City Commission, where he served five two-year terms.

In 2010, McCann was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives. During this time, he was a member of the Appropriations Committee and proudly voted to expand health insurance to more than 600,000 Michiganians and raise the state’s minimum wage. Additionally, McCann proposed legislation to end the practice of gerrymandering and helped successfully establish an Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission.
