ABOUT
State Sen. John Damoose was elected in 2022 to represent the 37th Senate District, which includes Antrim, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Emmet, Grand Traverse, Leelanau counties and parts of Mackinac and Chippewa counties.

CAREER
Upon graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in political science in 1994, Sen. Damoose secured a job at the Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach, Virginia. While there, he learned his craft working on the 700 Club television program, and ultimately wrote and produced a two-hour documentary on the story of America called “Victory in Spite of All Terror.” This marked the beginning of a career that would involve interviewing thousands of leaders from all walks of life and telling the story of the American character to millions of people through television and online video.

In 1997, John co-authored a book with Dr. Bill Bright, the founder and president of Campus Crusade for Christ. The book explored the founding principles of the United States and was ultimately hand-delivered to every member of the U.S. Congress.

After working with his family to launch several non-profit organizations and rekindle the venerated Religious Heritage of America Foundation, John and his father started 45 North Productions in the year 2000, with the purpose of telling the stories of character, sacrifice and dedication that made America a great nation. Over the course of the next twenty years, this pursuit would lead John to co-author and produce nine national television specials on all-American themes like Arlington National Cemetery, the Medal of Honor, military families, NASA, and many others. John and his father were contracted by the Department of Defense to produce the official documentary celebrating the opening of the 9/11 Pentagon Memorial. Both John and his father had been in the Pentagon when the plane struck seven years earlier.

Throughout the years, 45 North Productions has produced dozens of high-profile tribute videos for leaders from all walks of life, and interviewed hundreds of the nation’s top political, military and corporate leaders — including two presidents, numerous secretaries of defense and chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and dozens of U.S. senators and representatives. From each interview, John learned lessons about leadership, government, and solid conservative principles that he now hopes to apply to the state Legislature in Michigan.

He also wrote, directed and produced “The New American Road.” The three-part series was commissioned by Ford Motor Company and tells the powerful story of what many believe is the quintessential American industry.

For nearly 25 years, John has been a close associate of the organization that runs the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C. In recent years, he has served as the executive director of Building America’s Tomorrow — an organization that launched a series of initiatives dedicated to rebuilding America’s manufacturing workforce and encouraging career and technical education programs.

FAMILY
John and his wife Margo, who currently serves as director of the Harbor Springs Downtown Development Authority and member of the Harbor Springs School Board, reside in Harbor Springs with their four children. They are committed Christian believers whose top priorities in this life are to pour themselves into raising their children and help restore American society and the solid principles upon which we were founded.
