Jim Hamilton is an American politician who has been serving in the Montana House of Representatives since 2017. He is a member of the Democratic Party and represents District 61. Hamilton was born on August 29, 1959, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He currently resides in Bozeman, Montana, and is married with two children. He received his education from Eastern Michigan University.

Hamilton has been actively involved in various committees during his tenure. These include the Appropriations Committee, Joint Interim Committee on Revenue, Joint Legislative Finance Committee, Joint Subcommittee on Long-Range Planning, Legislative Administration Committee (where he served as Vice Chair), and the Rules Committee.

In terms of legislative actions, Hamilton supported increasing the tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack of cigarettes in 2017, although the bill did not pass out of the tax committee. He opposed the tax plan put forward by national members of the Republican Party in 2017, arguing that these would worsen the state's deficit. In 2021, he co-sponsored a "move over, slow down" bill to strengthen laws protecting first responders directing traffic, after two tow truck operators were killed in an accident. He also opposed a push by Republican state legislators to impose a strict dress code in the House of Representatives, which would have mandated suits and ties.

Hamilton has had a successful electoral history. In the 2016 Montana House of Representatives 61st district general election, he received 55.06% of the votes. In the 2018 general election, he received 74.9% of the votes. In the 2020 general election, he ran unopposed and received 100% of the votes. He won re-election to a fourth term in the 2022 Montana House of Representatives election.
