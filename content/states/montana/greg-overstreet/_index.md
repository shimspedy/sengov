Greg Overstreet has a rich and inspiring background.

His Christian beliefs have played a significant role in shaping his values and guiding his actions, both personally and professionally. He is also deeply connected to his heritage as an enrolled citizen of the Muscogee (Creek) Indian Nation, a legacy that has inspired him to pursue a life of service and leadership.

In addition to his legislative duties, Overstreet is actively involved in his local community. He serves as the Town Attorney for Stevensville and contributes to public discourse through his column, "Ask an Attorney," in the Bitterroot Star. He also finds joy in mentoring young minds as a coach for the Stevensville High School mock trial team, encouraging students to explore careers in law.

Greg Overstreet's life story is a testament to resilience, dedication, and a profound sense of purpose. From overcoming personal challenges to achieving professional success, he continues to serve as a role model and advocate for his constituents in District 88.
