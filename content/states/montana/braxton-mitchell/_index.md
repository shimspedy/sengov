Braxton Mitchell was born on May 20, 2000, in Whitefish, Montana. He is an American politician and businessman serving as a Republican member of the Montana House of Representatives from the 3rd district. Elected in 2020, he assumed office on January 4, 2021, and became one of the youngest elected officials in the country.

Early Life and Education:
Mitchell was born in Columbia Falls, Montana, and was later adopted. He grew up working for his family's businesses in Columbia Falls, most notably Montana Jerky Company. While attending Columbia Falls High School, he organized a pro-gun walkout after millions of students nationwide walked out to protest gun rights. Mitchell attended Flathead Valley Community College after high school.

Career:
Mitchell's involvement in politics began in 2017 during a special election for Montana's lone congressional district, where Republican Greg Gianforte defeated Democrat Rob Quist. Mitchell saw many of his own beliefs reflected in Gianforte, and helped with his campaign as a high school student. In 2020, he ran for the 3rd district of the Montana House of Representatives. Mitchell defeated incumbent Democrat Debo Powers in the November general election by 20 points, and became one of the youngest elected officials in the country. In 2022, he filed for re-election. In June 2022, Mitchell faced a Republican primary challenger who Mitchell accused of being a Democrat because she changed her party affiliation just days before the filing deadline. Mitchell easily defeated his primary challenger with over 73% of the vote. In November 2022, Mitchell easily won re-election. Mitchell currently serves as a member on the powerful House Judiciary Committee, the House Education Committee, and the House Agricultural Committee. In his first session, Mitchell served as a member on the House Taxation Committee, the House Education Committee, and the House Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Committee. In 2023, Mitchell introduced 10 bills with 9 of them passing the Montana House and Senate.
