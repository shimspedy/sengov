Braxton Mitchell is a prominent American politician and businessman who has made significant strides in Montana's political landscape. Born on May 20, 2000, in Whitefish, Montana, Mitchell grew up in Columbia Falls, where he was later adopted. His early years were shaped by his involvement in his family's businesses, including the Montana Jerky Company, which instilled in him a strong work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit.

Mitchell's political journey began during his high school years at Columbia Falls High School, where he demonstrated leadership and a passion for civic engagement. Notably, he organized a pro-gun walkout in response to nationwide protests advocating for gun control, showcasing his commitment to his beliefs. After graduating, he attended Flathead Valley Community College, furthering his education while remaining deeply connected to his community.

In 2017, Mitchell's interest in politics took a decisive turn when he supported Republican Greg Gianforte's campaign during a special election for Montana's lone congressional district. Inspired by Gianforte's values, Mitchell became actively involved in the campaign, laying the foundation for his future in public service.

In 2020, at just 20 years old, Mitchell ran for the Montana House of Representatives to represent the 3rd district. His campaign resonated with voters, and he defeated incumbent Democrat Debo Powers by a significant margin, becoming one of the youngest elected officials in the United States. His victory marked the beginning of a promising political career.

As a member of the Montana House of Representatives, Mitchell quickly established himself as a dedicated and effective legislator. He served on several influential committees, including the House Judiciary Committee, the House Education Committee, and the House Agriculture Committee. In his first legislative session, he also contributed to the House Taxation Committee and the House Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Committee. His legislative efforts have been marked by a focus on issues such as education, agriculture, and taxation, reflecting his commitment to addressing the needs of his constituents.

Mitchell's leadership and dedication have not gone unnoticed. He currently serves as the Republican Majority Whip of the Montana House of Representatives and as the Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. His ability to navigate complex legislative processes and build consensus has earned him respect among his peers and constituents alike.

Beyond his legislative work, Mitchell has been an active ambassador for Turning Point USA, a conservative nonprofit organization that seeks to educate and empower young people to advocate for free markets and limited government. His involvement with the organization underscores his dedication to fostering the next generation of conservative leaders.

Mitchell's political career has been characterized by his ability to connect with voters and address their concerns effectively. In 2022, he successfully secured re-election, further solidifying his position as a trusted representative for his district. His re-election campaign highlighted his achievements and his vision for the future of Montana.
