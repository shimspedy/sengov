Janet Ellis is currently a member of the Montana Senate, running for re-election in Senate District (SD) 41. She has served four sessions in the legislature since 2015. During all legislative sessions, she has served on one of the state budget committees, either Senate Finance & Claims or House Appropriations. During the 2021 Legislature, she also served on State Administration (which oversees pensions, elections, etc.) and Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation.

Janet has lived in Helena for over 30 years. She is married and has one son, who graduated from Helena High School in June 2013, and from college in May 2017. Her son started graduate school in the fall of 2021.

Janet retired in 2018 from her work at Montana Audubon, a science-based, citizen conservation organization dedicated to promoting “appreciation, knowledge and conservation of Montana’s native birds, other wildlife, and natural ecosystems to safeguard biological diversity for current and future generations.” As Audubon’s Senior Director of Policy, Janet coordinated Montana Audubon’s legislative and public policy work on behalf of Montana’s wildlife and wildlife habitat between 1983 and 2018.

Her work at Audubon resulted in Janet receiving several awards, including “Conservationist of the Year” from the Montana Environmental Information Center, Montana Wildlife Federation, and Montana Audubon; a 2016 “Lifetime Award for Conservation and Clean Energy Achievement” from the National Wildlife Federation; and a 2013 “Special Achievement Award” from the Montana Native Plant Society.

Before joining Audubon, Janet worked as a ranger and naturalist for Yellowstone and Zion National Parks, Cedar Breaks National Monument, and Lewis and Clark Caverns State Park. She has a degree in biology from the University of Montana. Among other adventures, Janet has bicycled from Missoula to Denali, Alaska, and from Oregon to the tip of Baja, Mexico. In college, she also spent four months in Churchill, Manitoba, studying polar bears.
