Scott Rosenzweig is a dedicated public servant, entrepreneur, and community leader who represents District 57 in the Montana House of Representatives. Born in Tucson, Arizona, in 1963, Scott's journey has been marked by a commitment to innovation, education, and service. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from Wesleyan University in 1985 and later pursued an MBA at Cornell University, graduating in 1991. These academic achievements laid the foundation for a career that would span multiple industries and continents.

Scott's professional life has been defined by his entrepreneurial spirit and leadership in the global satellite communications industry. Over the course of more than three decades, he has played a pivotal role in the success of several technology start-ups. After moving to Montana in 2005, he joined Orbit One Communications, a Bozeman-based company specializing in cutting-edge technology products. Under his leadership, the company achieved significant milestones, including major sales to the U.S. government and commercial clients. Following the sale of Orbit One to a public company, Scott co-founded Sypes Canyon Communications, another successful start-up that continues to operate today. He is currently a partner in Miranda Solutions Group, a small technology and communications company, and co-owner of several small businesses within his district.

Beyond his professional endeavors, Scott is deeply committed to his community. A resident of Montana for nearly two decades, he has been actively involved in various volunteer initiatives, including business mentoring programs, fundraising events, and local organizations like BridgerCare. His dedication to fostering innovation and supporting local businesses has made him a respected figure in his community.

Scott's personal life is equally rich and fulfilling. A lifelong long-distance runner, he has competed in numerous events and continues to embrace the discipline and perseverance that the sport demands. His global experiences, which include living in Hungary, Israel, and South Africa, have given him a unique perspective on cultural diversity and international relations. Fluent in multiple languages, including Hungarian, Arabic, and Hebrew, Scott brings a worldly understanding to his role as a legislator.

Family is at the heart of Scott's life. He grew up in rural Maryland, where his father worked as a mathematics professor and his mother served as a school teacher and social worker. Today, Scott is a proud parent of three children, all of whom have attended Montana's public schools and universities. His commitment to education and community development is deeply rooted in his own upbringing and family values.

Scott's entry into politics was driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact on the lives of his constituents. In the 2024 election, he ran as a Democratic candidate for the Montana House of Representatives and won a closely contested race for District 57. His victory was a testament to his dedication, resilience, and ability to connect with voters on issues that matter most to them. As a legislator, Scott is focused on promoting economic growth, improving access to healthcare, and ensuring quality education for all Montanans.
