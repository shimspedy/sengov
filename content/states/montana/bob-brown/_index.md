Bob Brown, born on December 11, 1947, is a member of the Republican Party and currently serves in the Montana State Senate, representing District 7. He assumed office on January 4, 2021, and his current term ends on January 6, 2025. Brown ran for election to the Montana State Senate to represent District 7 and won in the general election on November 3, 2020.

Before his current role, Brown served in the Montana House of Representatives. He has also held the position of Secretary of State for Montana and was the Republican nominee for Governor of Montana in 2004. Despite a heated race, he did not win the gubernatorial election.

Throughout his political career, Brown has been assigned to several committees. In the 2023-2024 legislative session, he served on the Fish and Game Committee as Vice Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Natural Resources Committee, and Senate Rules Committee.

In addition to his political roles, Brown has sponsored several pieces of legislation, including bills to revise sex offender level designations, revise FWP information disclosure laws, and establish reciprocity for out of state trappers.
