George Peter Nikolakakos is a dedicated public servant, a decorated military veteran, and a successful businessman who currently serves as a member of the Montana House of Representatives. Representing District 26, he has become a prominent figure in Montana politics, known for his commitment to his constituents and his passion for finding innovative solutions to the challenges facing his community.

Born on November 24, 1979, in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, George grew up with a strong sense of duty and service. He is the eldest of two children born to Peter and Debra Jean Nikolakakos. His upbringing instilled in him the values of hard work, integrity, and perseverance, which have guided him throughout his life.

George's journey of service began shortly after the September 11 attacks, when he enlisted in the United States Air Force. Over the course of two decades, he served with distinction, rising to the rank of Senior Master Sergeant. His military career included deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, where he played a critical role as an Airborne Intelligence Language Analyst. George's linguistic skills, honed during his time in the Air Force, allowed him to maintain fluency in five languages, a testament to his dedication and adaptability. He also served in key roles with the Montana Air National Guard, including as Superintendent of Intelligence for the 120th Air Wing and as a Nuclear Accountability Officer at Malmstrom Air Force Base.

After retiring from the military in 2021, George transitioned to civilian life with the same sense of purpose that had defined his military career. He established a successful real estate business in Montana, leveraging his expertise to contribute to the state's economic growth. His entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to fiscal responsibility earned him recognition as a leader in the housing sector.

George's entry into politics was driven by his desire to serve his community and make a positive impact on the lives of Montanans. In 2022, he ran for the Montana House of Representatives, representing District 26, which includes eastern Great Falls and Malmstrom Air Force Base. His campaign focused on addressing the needs of his constituents, promoting economic opportunity, and upholding the values enshrined in the U.S. and Montana Constitutions. George's dedication to these principles resonated with voters, and he won both the primary and general elections with significant support.

As a legislator, George has been a tireless advocate for his community. He has worked to cut taxes, eliminate unnecessary regulations, and strengthen the state's economy. His efforts have been recognized by organizations such as the Montana Housing Coalition, which named him "Montana Housing Legislator of the Year" in 2023, and the Chamber of Commerce, which honored him as a "Champion of Business." George's leadership extends beyond the legislature, as he actively participates in numerous state and local nonprofit boards, further demonstrating his commitment to public service.

George's personal life is a testament to his values and dedication to family. He married Melissa Lynn Durden on November 22, 2003, in Reno, Nevada, and together they have four children. The Nikolakakos family resides in Great Falls, Montana, where they are proud to be part of the community they serve. Melissa herself has followed in George's footsteps, becoming the Representative for Montana House District 20 in 2025, further exemplifying their shared commitment to public service.

Throughout his career, George Nikolakakos has remained steadfast in his belief that public service is a noble calling. He approaches his role as a legislator with integrity, respect, and a servant's heart, always putting the needs and interests of his constituents above his own. His dedication to finding win-win solutions and his unwavering commitment to the principles that have made Montana and the United States exceptional places to live continue to inspire those around him. George's legacy as a leader, a veteran, and a family man is a testament to the power of service and the enduring impact of a life dedicated to making a difference.
