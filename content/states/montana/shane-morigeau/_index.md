Shane Morigeau is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He was born on September 8, 1984, in Ronan, Montana. Morigeau is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation.

He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Montana School of Forestry and Conservation in 2007, a J.D. from the University of Montana School of Law in 2010, and a master of laws from the University of Arizona in 2011. His career includes working as a prosecutor and attorney with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes.

Morigeau served as a Democratic member of the Montana House of Representatives for District 95 from 2017 until 2021. In 2020, he ran for state auditor but was defeated in the general election. Less than a week after the 2020 general election, incumbent state senator Nate McConnell resigned and endorsed Morigeau as his successor. Morigeau was formally appointed by the Missoula County Board of Commissioners to serve in the Montana Senate.

As of now, he is a member of the Montana Senate from the 48th district. His current term ends on January 4, 2027.
