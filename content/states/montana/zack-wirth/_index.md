Zachary Wirth is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 80 in the Montana House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 3, 2023, and his current term is set to end on January 6, 2025. Wirth was appointed to the state House on January 3, 2023, to fill a vacancy after Representative Becky Beard was appointed to the state Senate.

Born and raised in Montana, Wirth's career experience includes working as a rancher at the Rocking Z Guest Ranch near Wolf Creek, Montana. In addition to his legislative duties, Wirth has been assigned to the Agriculture Committee, House State Administration Committee, and Transportation Committee for the 2023-2024 term.

Before his appointment, Wirth had also participated in the Montana House of Representatives elections in 2016. However, he was defeated by Becky Beard in the District 80 Republican primary. Despite the setback, Wirth continued his political journey, eventually earning his current position in the House of Representatives.
