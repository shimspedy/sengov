Fred Anderson was born on July 16, 1944, in Bozeman, Montana. He is an American educator and politician. He serves as a Republican member of the Montana House of Representatives, where he represents District 20, including parts of Great Falls, Montana.

In terms of education, Anderson earned a Bachelor of Science degree in broadfield science with minors in chemistry and automotive technology from Northern Montana College in 1967. He later earned a MEd in Vocational Administration from Colorado State University in 1979, and a PhD in Administration and Supervision from the same university in 1980.

Anderson served in the Montana Army National Guard and is also a cattle rancher in Montana. He started his career as a teacher at Miles Community College in 1968 and served until 1978. He then became an Assistant Principal in Miles City, Montana in 1979, and a Principal in Great Falls, Montana in 1982.

In 2014, Anderson ran for election to represent the 24th district, but lost the general election to Democrat Jean Price by 23 votes. However, on November 8, 2016, Anderson won the election and became a Republican member of Montana House of Representatives for District 20. He defeated Amy Rapp with 71.03% of the votes. As an incumbent, Anderson won the election on November 6, 2018, and continued serving District 20. He defeated Keaton Sunchild with 68.48% of the votes.

While Anderson was a Principal of Custer County District High School from 1982-2002, James Jensen, an athletic trainer, was allegedly sexually abused students there. In 2019, Anderson faced pressure from a county Republican leader to resign from his legislative position.

Anderson has been recognized for his work with the 2019 Champion of Business award, presented by Montana Chamber of Commerce, and the 2019 Silver Windmill award, presented by Montana Farm Bureau.
