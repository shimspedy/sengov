William Walter "Bill" Mercer, born in 1964 in Billings, Montana, is an American attorney and politician. He is currently serving as a member of the Montana House of Representatives from the 46th district. Mercer's educational background includes a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Montana, a Juris Doctor degree from George Mason University, and a Master of Public Administration from Harvard University.

Mercer's career in law and politics is extensive. From 1994 to April 2001, he served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Montana. On April 20, 2001, he was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve as the United States Attorney for the District of Montana. While remaining as the U.S. Attorney, Mercer served as principal associate deputy attorney general in the United States Department of Justice from 2005 to 2006. He later served as the acting United States Associate Attorney General starting in 2006, though resigned on June 22, 2007, in light of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys by the Bush administration. During his tenure as U.S. Attorney, he helped create Project Safe Childhood, a Department of Justice initiative which actively combats technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and child pornography.

In the Montana House of Representatives, Mercer chairs the House Judicial Committee, Law Enforcement and Justice Committee, and serves as a member on the House Appropriations Committee. Mercer first announced his candidacy to the Montana House of Representatives in 2018. He won the 2018 General Election with 59.2% of the vote. In 2020, he successfully won his reelection bid, receiving 67.7% of the vote in the general election.
