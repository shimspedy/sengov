Caleb Hinkle is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Montana House of Representatives from the 68th district. He was born on July 14, 1992, in Butte, Montana and now resides in Belgrade, Montana. Before his political career, Hinkle served in the United States Army and held the rank of Sergeant in the Montana Army National Guard. He also worked as the Western Montana field representative for Greg Gianforte.

Hinkle was elected to the Montana House of Representatives in November 2020 and assumed office on January 4, 2021. During the 67th Legislative Session, Hinkle introduced House Bill 242 that established the muzzleloader season, making Montana the last state to set aside a special season for muzzleloaders. This idea was inspired by his fascination with history and his father introducing him to movies depicting the use of muzzleloaders during the Civil War and by early fur trappers. In the 2020 election for Montanaâ€™s 68th District House of Representatives, Hinkle, representing the Republican Party, secured 66.7% of the votes. He ran for re-election in 2022 and won the general election on November 8, 2022, with 65.8% of the votes.
