SJ Howell is a member of the Democratic Party serving in the Montana House of Representatives. They represent District 100 and assumed office on January 6, 2025. Their current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born in Billings, Montana, SJ Howell has dedicated their career to advocacy and public service. They earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Montana and currently reside in Missoula. Before entering politics, Howell served as the executive director of Montana Women Vote, a nonprofit organization focused on engaging low-income women in the democratic process as informed voters, policy advocates, and community leaders. Their work in this role highlighted their commitment to social justice and equality, particularly for women and the LGBTQ+ community.

Howell first entered the Montana Legislature in 2023, representing District 95. They made history as one of the first openly transgender individuals elected to the state legislature in Montana. During their initial term, Howell introduced several pieces of legislation, including efforts to expand eligibility for childcare scholarships under Montana's Best Beginnings program. Although their proposals faced challenges in a Republican-dominated legislature, Howell's advocacy underscored their dedication to progressive policies and community welfare.

Due to redistricting, Howell ran for and won the seat for District 100 in the 2024 elections. Their victory was a testament to their strong connection with constituents and their ability to address the needs of their community effectively. As a legislator, Howell has been an outspoken advocate for marginalized groups, often taking a stand on controversial issues to ensure that all voices are heard in the legislative process.

In addition to their legislative work, Howell has been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and has actively opposed bills perceived as discriminatory. Their leadership and resilience have made them a prominent figure in Montana politics, inspiring many to engage in civic activities and fight for equality and justice. Howell's journey reflects a deep commitment to creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all Montanans.
