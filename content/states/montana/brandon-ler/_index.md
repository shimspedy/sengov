Brandon Ler is an American politician from the state of Montana. He is a Republican member of the Montana House of Representatives for district 35. He assumed office on January 4, 2021.

Born in 1985 in Sidney, Montana, U.S., Ler owns and operates a fencing company and served for six years on the Savage School District Board of Education. He is also a rancher.

In February 2023, Ler introduced a bill that would state that misgendering a transgender student or calling them by their dead name —the name they were given at birth — is not considered a discriminatory practice. Ler characterized the bill as an effort to ensure students aren't punished by teachers or school officials for references made out of confusion.

In the 2020 State House of Representatives election for Montana's 35th District, Ler received 1,457 votes (52.60%) in the Republican primary. He was uncontested in the general election, having received 4,760 votes.
