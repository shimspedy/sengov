Becky Edwards is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Montana House of Representatives, representing District 61. Her journey into politics is deeply rooted in her passion for conservation, community engagement, and empowering women. Born and raised on a farm in eastern Iowa, Becky grew up with a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for the environment. Her upbringing instilled in her a sense of responsibility to protect natural resources and advocate for sustainable practices.

After completing her education at Montana State University in Bozeman, Becky chose to make Montana her home. Over the past 26 years, she has built a life in Bozeman, raising her family and contributing to the community in various capacities. Her professional career is a testament to her commitment to making a difference. As the executive director of a conservation nonprofit called Mountain Mamas, Becky has worked tirelessly to elevate women's voices on critical environmental issues. Her leadership has been instrumental in shaping policies that prioritize conservation and sustainability.

In addition to her work with Mountain Mamas, Becky co-owns a marketing firm that specializes in communications for a diverse range of clients, including government agencies, financial institutions, and nonprofit organizations. Her expertise in strategic communication has been a valuable asset in her efforts to bridge the gap between policymakers and the communities they serve.

Becky's adventurous spirit and love for the outdoors have also played a significant role in shaping her perspective. As a former mountaineering guide, she has traveled the world, climbing and skiing in some of the most challenging terrains. These experiences have not only deepened her connection to nature but have also reinforced her belief in the importance of preserving it for future generations.

Her political career began with a desire to influence legislation at both the state and federal levels. Over the past 15 years, Becky has been actively involved in advocating for policies that address pressing issues such as conservation financing, women's healthcare rights, and the protection of Montana's constitution. Her dedication to these causes has earned her the trust and support of her constituents.

In November 2024, Becky Edwards was elected to the Montana House of Representatives, where she continues to champion the values and priorities of her district. Her leadership is characterized by a collaborative approach, a commitment to transparency, and an unwavering dedication to the well-being of her community. Through her work, Becky strives to create a Montana that is not only prosperous but also inclusive and sustainable for generations to come.
