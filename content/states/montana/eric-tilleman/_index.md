Eric Tilleman is a dedicated public servant and educator who currently serves as a member of the Montana House of Representatives, representing District 23. His journey to this position is marked by a deep commitment to education, community service, and leadership.

Born and raised in Chinook, Montana, Eric developed a strong connection to his community and a passion for agriculture from an early age. He pursued his education at Montana State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural education. This academic foundation laid the groundwork for his future endeavors in both teaching and public service.

Eric's professional career began in the classroom, where he spent 16 years teaching agriculture at Cascade High School. During this time, he not only educated students but also inspired them to pursue careers in agriculture and technical fields. His dedication to teaching earned him recognition as the Montana Career and Technical Education Teacher of the Year in 2014, an honor bestowed by the Montana Association for Career and Technical Education. Additionally, he received the Ideas Unlimited award from the Montana Association of Agricultural Educators, further highlighting his innovative approach to education.

Beyond the classroom, Eric took on leadership roles that showcased his commitment to his community. He served as the fire chief for the Cascade Volunteer Fire Department, demonstrating his willingness to step up in times of need. In 2020, he transitioned to a role as an agricultural education specialist in the Montana Office of Public Instruction, where he worked to enhance agricultural education programs across the state. His expertise and leadership were further recognized when he was elected as President of the National Association of Agricultural Educators for the 2023-2024 term.

Eric's journey into politics began with his appointment to the Montana House of Representatives in July 2024, following the resignation of his predecessor. He quickly made an impact, winning the general election later that year with a decisive majority. As a legislator, Eric has been assigned to key committees, including State Administration, Education, and Agriculture, where he continues to advocate for policies that benefit his constituents and the state of Montana.

Throughout his career, Eric Tilleman has remained deeply committed to serving his community, whether through education, emergency services, or legislative work. His dedication, leadership, and passion for making a positive impact have earned him the respect and admiration of those he serves.
