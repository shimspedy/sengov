Luke Muszkiewicz, a member of the Democratic Party, serves in the Montana House of Representatives, representing District 79. He assumed office on January 6, 2025, and his current term is set to conclude on January 4, 2027.

Born and raised in Helena, Montana, Luke has deep roots in the community he represents. He resides in Helena with his wife, Virginia, and their family. Professionally, he works as a software engineer and data analyst, bringing a strong analytical mindset to his legislative duties. Before entering the Montana Legislature, Luke served on the Helena Public Schools Board of Trustees for six years, from 2017 to 2023, including three years as Board Chair. During his tenure, he chaired several committees, such as Budget & Finance, Facilities & Maintenance, and Policy, showcasing his commitment to public education and fiscal responsibility.

Luke's primary motivation for running for office was to advocate for public education. He is deeply committed to addressing the challenges faced by schools in Helena and across Montana, including budget deficits and the need for a fair state funding formula. He believes in upholding the constitutional obligation to provide free quality education to all Montanans and is determined to ensure that the state fulfills its responsibilities in this regard.

In addition to his focus on education, Luke is a staunch advocate for preserving the rights enshrined in the Montana Constitution, including privacy, public land access, and environmental protection. He is also dedicated to addressing critical issues such as Medicaid expansion, property tax relief, and affordable housing. Luke has been vocal about standing against legislative measures that he believes undermine the health, safety, and opportunities of Montanans, including restrictions on reproductive healthcare and the rights of the LGBTQ+ community.

Luke's approach to governance is rooted in collaboration and community engagement. He actively seeks input from the residents of District 79 to understand their priorities and concerns. With a vision for a better Montana, Luke Muszkiewicz remains committed to protecting the quality of life cherished by his constituents while working towards a brighter future for all.
