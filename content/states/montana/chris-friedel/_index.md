The story of my life is deeply rooted in family values and a legacy of entrepreneurship that has shaped my character and ambitions. Born into a bustling household with four boys, I was raised by parents who not only managed their own business but also instilled in me an unwavering work ethic that continues to guide my actions and decisions. This upbringing, centered around hard work and determination, laid the foundation for my aspirations and achievements.

My academic and athletic journey took me to Billings West High School, from where I graduated with not just a diploma, but a scholarship to play football at Montana Tech. Inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of my father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, I aspired to carve out my path as a business owner. Thus, my academic focus was on Small Business Marketing and Financing, a field that promised to equip me with the knowledge and skills necessary to realize my dreams.

Upon completing my college education, I embarked on a new chapter of my life, one that would not have been as fulfilling without my wonderful wife, Leslie. Together for twelve years, Leslie and I have been blessed with two beautiful children, Arabella and Liam, who have brought endless joy and purpose into our lives.

My journey into public service began in 2015 when the residents of Ward 3 in Billings honored me with their trust, electing me to the Billings City Council. During my four-year tenure, I dedicated myself to serving the community with integrity and commitment. My decisions on the Council were guided by principles that reflected the values instilled in me by my upbringing:

- Opposing tax increases to ease the financial burden on our citizens.
- Advocating for practical measures like snow removal on residential streets to improve daily life.
- Supporting the construction of the West End Reservoir to guarantee a reliable water supply for Billings.
- Rejecting pay increases for City Council Members to ensure fiscal responsibility.
- Eliminating wasteful spending from the city budget to optimize resource allocation.
- Championing the repair of neglected streets to enhance the quality of our infrastructure.
- Expanding the 911 Call Center to improve emergency response times.
- Advocating for the hiring of additional police officers and firefighters to ensure the safety and security of our community.

My commitment to public service continued to deepen as I transitioned to the role of State Senator, where I served in the 67th and 68th sessions. My responsibilities expanded to include membership on the Judiciary Committee, chairing the Local Government Committee, and vice-chairing the Highway and Transportation Committee. My tenure was marked by significant legislative achievements, including:

- Passing SB 127 to guarantee the election of all municipal judges by the people.
- Introducing SB 289, which grants tuition waivers to qualified survivors of firefighters and peace officers who die in the line of duty.
- Strengthening the privacy of marital communication through SB 325.
- Maintaining my stance against tax increases to protect the financial well-being of Montanans.
- Enhancing criminal laws to ensure justice and safety.
- Advocating for the rights of gun ownership by removing unnecessary restrictions.
- Streamlining housing laws to address restrictive regulations and red tape.

My political journey is a reflection of my commitment to serve my community, uphold the values taught to me by my family, and work tirelessly towards a better future for all. My story is one of dedication, service, and a deep-rooted belief in the potential of our community and its people.
