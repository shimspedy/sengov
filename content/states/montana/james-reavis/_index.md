James Reavis is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Montana House of Representatives, representing District 47. Born and raised in the vibrant city of Butte, Montana, James grew up in a community that valued hard work, resilience, and a strong sense of unity. His upbringing in a family deeply connected to Montana's heritage shaped his commitment to serving the people of his state.

James's mother operates a cattle ranch outside of Boulder, Montana, while his father is an architect specializing in preserving historic buildings. These influences instilled in him a deep appreciation for Montana's rich history and the importance of preserving its cultural and natural resources.

After earning a law degree from the University of Montana and a Master's in Public Administration, James embarked on a career as a public defender. For over a decade, he worked tirelessly to ensure that the rights and liberties of individuals were protected under the Constitution. His experience in the legal field provided him with a profound understanding of the challenges faced by everyday Montanans, particularly those who are most vulnerable.

In addition to his work as a public defender, James has been actively involved in legislative processes. He has testified before the Montana Legislature in support of common-sense reforms and has contributed to drafting legal language for policies aimed at improving the lives of Montanans. His efforts have led to the passage of legislation that protects children from harm and reduces bureaucratic red tape in state government.

James's journey has not been without personal challenges. He has openly shared his experience with weight loss and the financial burdens associated with healthcare. These experiences have fueled his determination to advocate for affordable healthcare and to address the systemic issues that impact the well-being of Montanans.

In 2024, James ran for election to the Montana House of Representatives, driven by a desire to bring meaningful change to his community. His campaign focused on issues such as affordable housing, quality education, accessible childcare, and economic security. His dedication and vision resonated with voters, leading to his election as the representative for District 47.

As a legislator, James is committed to being an independent voice who listens to his constituents and follows the facts. He strives to improve the standard of living for all Montanans and to ensure that their voices are heard in the legislative process. With his legal expertise, public service experience, and unwavering determination, James Reavis continues to work toward a brighter future for the Treasure State.
