Gregory J. Hertz, born on December 30, 1957, in Malta, Montana, is an American businessman and politician. He is a member of the Republican Party and currently represents District 6 in the Montana State Senate.

Hertz attended the University of Montana, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration. In 1998, he became the majority owner, President, and CEO of Moody's Market, Incorporated, an operator of grocery stores in Polson, Montana.

Hertz's political career began when he won the election and became a Republican member of the Montana House of Representatives for District 11 in 2012. He later represented District 12 from 2015 to 2021. During his tenure, he served as the Majority Whip of the House during the 2015-2016 session and as the Speaker of the Montana House of Representatives from 2019 to 2021.

Due to Montana's rules on term limits, Hertz was unable to run for a 5th term in the House. He was elected in 2021 to a 4-year term for Senate District 6.

Hertz is married to Kate Hertz, and they have three children. They reside in Polson, Montana.
