Debo Powers is a dedicated public servant and educator who has made significant contributions to her community and the state of Montana. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she pursued her education with a strong focus on learning and leadership. She graduated from Florida State University, where she laid the foundation for her career in education and public service.

Debo's professional journey began in the classroom as a public school teacher, where she inspired countless students with her passion for learning. Her commitment to education led her to take on the role of a school principal, a position she held from 1998 to 2011. During her tenure, she demonstrated exceptional leadership skills and a deep dedication to fostering a positive and enriching environment for both students and staff.

In 2019, Debo transitioned from education to politics, driven by her desire to serve her community in a broader capacity. She was appointed to represent District 3 in the Montana House of Representatives, stepping into the role after the resignation of her predecessor. Her district, located in northern Flathead County, stretches from Columbia Falls to the Canadian border, encompassing a region known for its natural beauty and vibrant communities.

Although her initial term was brief, Debo's impact was significant. She ran for a full term in 2020, showcasing her commitment to representing the interests of her constituents.

In 2024, she returned to the political arena and successfully won the election for District 3, defeating her opponent with a narrow but decisive margin. She assumed office in January 2025, ready to bring her experience, energy, and vision to the 69th Montana Legislature.

Beyond her professional achievements, Debo is deeply connected to the land and community she serves. A resident of Polebridge, Montana, she has built a life that reflects her values of sustainability and environmental stewardship. Living in a solar-powered home off the grid, she embodies a commitment to preserving Montana's natural resources. Her love for the outdoors is evident in her volunteer work as a Wilderness Patrol member in Glacier National Park and a Fire Lookout in Flathead National Forest. She has also served on the boards of several conservation organizations, advocating for the protection of public lands and wildlife.

Debo's multifaceted life includes a passion for dance, gardening, and community engagement. She has competed in national dance competitions, taught dance classes, and cultivated a thriving garden that reflects her dedication to self-sufficiency and environmental harmony. Her vibrant personality and tireless work ethic have earned her the respect and admiration of those around her.
