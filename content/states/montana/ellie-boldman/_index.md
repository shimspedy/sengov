Born on June 30, 1975, in Scottsdale, Arizona, Ellie grew up with a strong sense of justice and a passion for making a difference. Her journey into public service began with her academic pursuits, which laid the foundation for her impactful career.

Ellie attended Boise State University, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology with a minor in English in 1997.

During her time in law school, Ellie demonstrated her leadership abilities as the president of the student chapter of the Idaho Trial Lawyers Association and gained valuable experience through internships with the Nez Perce Tribal Court and the Garden City Attorney's Office.

Ellie's professional career began in the legal field, where she worked as an assistant district attorney and later as a licensed attorney at her own law firm.

She served on various committees, including the Human Services and Judiciary Committees, where she worked tirelessly to advance policies that benefited her constituents.

In 2020, Ellie transitioned to the Montana State Senate, representing District 45. Her leadership and dedication to public service continued to shine as she took on new challenges and responsibilities. Throughout her political career, Ellie has been a vocal advocate for women's rights, social justice, and environmental sustainability. She has also been actively involved in national organizations, serving on the boards of the National Conference of State Legislatures and the American Association of University Women.

Beyond her professional achievements, Ellie is a devoted wife and mother. She lives in Missoula, Montana, with her husband, Tyler Smith, and their three children.
