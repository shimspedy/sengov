Melody Cunningham is a Democratic Party member serving in the Montana House of Representatives. She represents District 97 and assumed office on January 6, 2025. Her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Born in Augusta, Maine, Melody Cunningham has had a distinguished career that spans education, medicine, and public service. She earned her bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in 1988 and later pursued her medical degree at the University of Massachusetts, graduating in 1994. Her professional journey began as a high school chemistry and physics teacher, where she worked with students from underserved, inner-city areas. This early experience ignited her passion for advocacy and equity.

Cunningham transitioned into medicine, dedicating over three decades to pediatric care. She initially worked as a pediatric oncologist, providing critical care to children battling cancer. In the latter half of her medical career, she specialized in pediatric hospice and palliative medicine, focusing on providing compassionate end-of-life care and support to children and their families. Her work in this field has been widely recognized for its empathy and impact.

In addition to her medical career, Cunningham has been a vocal advocate for children and families, often amplifying the voices of those who are marginalized or underrepresented. Her decision to enter politics was driven by her commitment to civil and thoughtful decision-making, as well as her desire to bring her extensive experience in advocacy to the legislative arena.

As a legislator, Cunningham is known for her dedication to issues such as healthcare reform, education equity, and social justice. Her approach to governance is rooted in her belief in thoughtful, inclusive policymaking that addresses the needs of all constituents. Residing in Missoula, Montana, she continues to engage actively with her community, ensuring that their voices are heard in the state legislature.
