Paul Tuss is an American Democratic politician serving as a member of the Montana House of Representatives for the 28th district. Born in 1964 or 1965 in Anaconda, Montana, Tuss grew up in nearby Opportunity. He graduated from Anaconda High School and received his bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Montana (UM) in 1988.

Tuss, the youngest of five children of Mary Jane and Walter Tuss, was a member of Alpha Tau Omega, UM Advocates, and the College Democrats, and was named one of the 1986 Outstanding Young Men of America. He met his wife, Pam Hillery, while studying at UM. They were married for 27 years before her death in 2016. The couple had a son named Dolan and a daughter named Caroline.

Tuss worked in economic development in rural northern Montana. He was the executive director of the Bear Paw Development Corporation for over 20 years and chaired organizations like the Montana Board of Regents of Higher Education and the Montana Economic Developers Association. Tuss also served on boards for the Havre Area Chamber of Commerce, the Northern Montana Hospital, the Montana Cooperative Development Center and the Evergreen Chapter of the ALS Association.

Tuss ran for Secretary of State of Montana in 2000, losing in the Democratic primary. In 2018, Tuss challenged Republican incumbent Russel Tempel for his Montana Senate seat representing the 14th district, losing the race by 132 votes. After conceding the race, Tuss said he "certainly [did not] have any interest in running in the near future." In February 2022, Tuss announced his candidacy in the 2022 election to represent the 28th district in the Montana House of Representatives. Tuss was elected to the seat in November, defeating Republican incumbent Ed Hill.
