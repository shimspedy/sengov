Paul Tuss is a dedicated public servant and a prominent figure in Montana's political landscape. Born in Anaconda, Montana, in the mid-1960s, he grew up in the nearby community of Opportunity as the youngest of five children in a close-knit family. His parents, Mary Jane and Walter Tuss, instilled in him the values of hard work, community service, and perseverance.

Paul graduated from Anaconda High School and pursued higher education at the University of Montana, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science in 1988. During his time at the university, he was an active member of Alpha Tau Omega, UM Advocates, and the College Democrats. His leadership and dedication were recognized when he was named one of the Outstanding Young Men of America in 1986.

While at the University of Montana, Paul met Pam Hillery, who would become his wife and lifelong partner. The couple shared 27 years of marriage before Pam's passing in 2016. Together, they raised two children, Dolan and Caroline, and built a life centered on family and community.

Paul's professional career has been marked by a strong commitment to economic development and public service. For over two decades, he served as the executive director of the Bear Paw Development Corporation, where he worked tirelessly to promote economic growth and opportunity in rural northern Montana. His leadership extended to various organizations, including the Montana Board of Regents of Higher Education, the Montana Economic Developers Association, and the Havre Area Chamber of Commerce. He also contributed to the boards of the Northern Montana Hospital, the Montana Cooperative Development Center, and the Evergreen Chapter of the ALS Association.

In addition to his work in economic development, Paul has been an active participant in Montana's political scene. He ran for Secretary of State of Montana in 2000 and served as a state co-chair for Al Gore's presidential campaign that same year. Although he faced setbacks, such as narrowly losing a Montana Senate race in 2018, Paul remained steadfast in his commitment to public service.

In 2022, Paul announced his candidacy for the Montana House of Representatives, representing the 28th district. His campaign focused on addressing the needs of his constituents and fostering bipartisan solutions to the challenges facing Montana. He won the election by a significant margin, marking a major victory for the Democratic Party in the state. Following redistricting, Paul successfully ran for reelection in 2024, this time representing the 27th district.

Throughout his career, Paul Tuss has demonstrated an unwavering dedication to improving the lives of Montanans. His work in economic development, education, and public service reflects his deep commitment to the values of community, integrity, and progress. As a member of the Montana House of Representatives, Paul continues to advocate for policies that promote economic opportunity, education, and the well-being of all Montanans.
