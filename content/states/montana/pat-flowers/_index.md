Pat Flowers moved to Montana from Ohio in 1977 as a college junior to finish his undergraduate degree in forestry, and complete a master’s degree in forest economics at the University of Montana. He went on to a career in forest fire research, forest economics, forest management, and fish, wildlife and parks. He raised two daughters in Montana with his wife, Hedvig, who passed away in 2007. In 2014 he remarried. His wife, Melissa, and he now share four adult daughters. Three of them live and work in Bozeman, and the fourth takes them to Oregon.

Pat was elected to the Montana State Senate in 2018, and served in the 2019 and 2021 Legislative Sessions. In both sessions he was a member of the Senate Finance and Claims, Senate Natural Resources and Senate Fish and Game Committees. During the interim between legislative sessions he served on the Legislative Audit Committee, the Environmental Quality Council and the Legislative Council. He also served as Minority Whip for the Montana Senate Democratic Caucus in the 2021 Legislature.

Pat is running for Senate District 32 to strengthen the reasons why people choose to live, work and recreate in Montana — including a robust public education system, access to affordable health care, and exceptional open access to rivers and public lands. He brings a lifetime of public-service experience working to address Montana’s toughest natural resource issues.

Throughout his public service career, Pat has demonstrated integrity. He has taken on some of the toughest issues in Montana and through it all maintained a commitment to the sound management of resources and the well-being of citizens. Pat has shown great perseverance on issues like elk management where he pushed for solutions that recognized the concerns of private landowners, while focusing on the goal of managing elk as valued Montana wildlife of great importance to sportsmen and women. As a public servant Pat has embraced transparency in government, hosting hundreds of public meetings and forums on difficult issues. He understands the value and need for state government to find solutions in an open setting where Montana citizens can participate.
