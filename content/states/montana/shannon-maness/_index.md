Shannon Maness has a rich and diverse background that reflects his deep connection to Montana and his commitment to public service. Born and raised in Georgia, Shannon grew up in a conservative household where he developed a strong work ethic and a passion for the outdoors. He graduated from the University of Georgia in 1999 with a degree in animal science and a minor in agricultural economics.

Later, he transitioned to managing a recreational ranch and eventually started his own business, Blacktail Appliance Repair, in 2018.

He has served as an elected trustee of the Dillon Elementary School Board and as the finance chairman of the Beaverhead County Republican Central Committee. Additionally, he has been involved with youth hunting programs and local landlord associations. His faith plays a central role in his life, guiding his values and principles.

As a legislator, Shannon Maness is committed to upholding conservative values and working collaboratively with his colleagues to create laws that protect families and foster opportunities for growth.
