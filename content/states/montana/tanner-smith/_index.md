Tanner J. Smith is an American politician who serves in the Montana House of Representatives for District 11. He is from Stevensville, Montana and is a member of the Republican Party.

Smith is the owner of Tanner J. Smith Construction and has served on the board of trustees for the Somers Lakeside School District. He ran for the Montana House of Representatives to succeed Derek Skees, who did not run for reelection in 2022. Smith's motivation for running was the opening of recreational cannabis dispensaries in his district and his desire to further regulate them.

In the Republican Party primary election, Smith defeated Ronalee Skees and Devon Decker. In June 2023, he announced that he would run for the Republican nomination for governor of Montana in the 2024 election, challenging incumbent Greg Gianforte.
