Bruce "Butch" Gillespie, born in 1946, is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He represents the 9th district in the Montana State Senate. Gillespie assumed office on January 7, 2019.

In 2018, Gillespie ran for the open seat in the 9th district after the former Montana State Senator, Llew Jones, was unable to run for re-election due to term limits. Gillespie won the Republican primary with 68.7% of the vote, and went on to win the general election with 73.2% of the vote.

As of June 2020, Gillespie sits on the following committees: Natural Resources, Taxation, Agriculture, Livestock, and Irrigation.
