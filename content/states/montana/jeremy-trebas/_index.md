Jeremy Trebas is a member of the Republican Party and currently serves in the Montana State Senate, representing District 13. He assumed office on January 2, 2023, and his current term ends on January 4, 2027.

Before his tenure in the State Senate, Trebas was a member of the Montana House of Representatives, representing District 25 from 2017 to 2018 and District 26 from 2021 to 2022.

Born in Missoula, Montana, Trebas earned a bachelor's degree in business administration. His career experience includes working as an accountant, a human resources manager with the Great Falls Rescue Mission, and owning a tax preparation and accounting business.

In addition to his political career, Trebas has served on a number of boards and volunteered for organizations such as the City of Great Falls on the Audit Committee, Echoz, and the Great Falls Pachyderm Club.

He has been married to Hannah for 16 years and they have three children, Ryan 13, Kaylyn 12, and Aidan 10. They live near the minor league baseball stadium, North Kiwanis Park and Northside IGA. The family enjoys camping and exploring Montana in their truck and camper, often bringing along their two pups, a schnauzer/border collie mix and a border-doodle.
