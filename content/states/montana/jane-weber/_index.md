Jane Weber is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Montana House of Representatives, representing District 19. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, after winning the 2024 general election. A member of the Democratic Party, Weber's district includes downtown Great Falls, Montana, where she has been an active and influential figure in the community.

Born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Weber pursued her education with a passion for both the arts and the environment. She earned a bachelor's degree in Art Education from Kutztown State College in 1975 and later obtained another bachelor's degree in Forest Science from the University of Montana in 1982. Her academic journey also included post-graduate studies in Outdoor Recreation, reflecting her deep connection to nature and her commitment to environmental stewardship.

Weber's professional career is as diverse as it is impactful. She worked as a forester and played a pivotal role in the development of the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center in Great Falls. Her dedication to this project extended to managing the center for a decade, during which she contributed significantly to its success and its role in educating the public about the region's rich history.

In addition to her work with the Interpretive Center, Weber served as a Cascade County commissioner for ten years. During her tenure, she focused on initiatives that improved the quality of life for residents and addressed critical issues facing the community. Her leadership extended to various non-profit boards, including the Black Eagle Superfund Cleanup Committee, the Mental Health Local Advisory Council, and the City-County Library Board. These roles highlight her commitment to public health, environmental sustainability, and education.

Weber's entry into the Montana House of Representatives marked a new chapter in her public service career. In the 2024 elections, she secured her seat by defeating her opponent, Hannah Trebas, with 55% of the vote. Her victory was a testament to her strong connection with the community and her ability to address the needs and concerns of her constituents. The redistricting process had led the incumbent, Russ Miner, to seek election in a different district, paving the way for Weber's successful campaign.

As a legislator, Weber has been assigned to the House Taxation and House Human Services committees, where she continues to advocate for policies that promote economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection. Her diverse background and extensive experience make her a valuable asset to the Montana Legislature and a dedicated representative for the people of District 19.

Weber's journey from Pennsylvania to Montana, her academic achievements, her professional contributions, and her unwavering commitment to public service paint a picture of a leader who is deeply invested in the well-being of her community and the state she serves. Her story is one of resilience, dedication, and a lifelong passion for making a difference.
