Born and raised in the heart of Montana, Mike grew up in White Sulphur Springs, where he developed a deep connection to the land and the values of hard work, independence, and community. His upbringing in this rugged and beautiful state instilled in him a lifelong passion for Montana's unique way of life.

He has actively supported numerous local organizations, including the Billings Playhouse Parade, Special Olympics, Eagle Mount, Optimist Club, youth sports programs, and the White Sulphur Springs Labor Day Rodeo. His dedication to community service reflects his belief in the importance of fostering strong, supportive communities.

Mike's journey into politics was driven by his desire to serve the people of Montana and contribute to the betterment of his state. He has been an active observer of Montana politics for many years and decided to step forward as a candidate for the Montana House of Representatives. In the 2024 elections, he successfully ran for the District 40 seat, earning the trust and support of his constituents. He officially assumed office on January 6, 2025, and is committed to representing the interests and values of his district.
