Jedediah Hinkle is an American politician and a Republican member of the Montana House of Representatives. He has been serving as a member of the Montana House of Representatives from the 67th district since January 4, 2021. He was preceded by Tom Burnett in this role. Prior to this, he served in the Montana Senate from the 32nd district from January 5, 2015, to January 7, 2019. He was succeeded by Pat Flowers in the Senate.

Hinkle was born in 1980 in Sitka, Alaska. He is married to Kyndall and they have one child. They reside in Belgrade, Montana. Hinkle is a graduate of Montana State University where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree. He works as a taxidermist.

In 2021, Hinkle supported moving same-day voter registration back one day to relieve pressure on elections offices while they counted ballots. He testified to individuals being bused in on election day, creating long lines that wrap around the block and being worked by political organizations. He stated that those who were bussing people to the elections office "were not from our side of the aisle", and such long lines on election night created much stress and strain on the elections department.
