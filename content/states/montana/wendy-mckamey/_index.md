Wendy McKamey, born on December 15, 1946 in Ogden, Utah, is an American politician from Montana. She is a member of the Republican Party. She has served as a member of the Montana Senate since 2023, representing District 12. Prior to this, she sat in the Montana House of Representatives from 2015 to 2023.

McKamey was first elected in 2014, in a race decided by just 16 votes, to represent District 23 in the Montana House of Representatives. In 2016, she was elected to represent District 19 and was re-elected to that position in 2018.

In 2021, McKamey proposed legislation to restrict voting rights in Montana. The legislation prohibited ballot collection, which at the time was common in communities where election infrastructure was limited, such as the Native American community in Montana, which is a Democratic-leaning constituency. The legislation was passed by the Republican-controlled State Legislature.

In 2022, McKamey was elected to the Montana Senate, defeating Democrat Jacob Bachmeier.

Apart from her political career, McKamey is also a rancher and musician. She earned her B.S. in housing and home management from Brigham Young University in 1969. She resides in Great Falls, Montana with her husband Les McKamey, and they have seven children.
