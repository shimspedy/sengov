She successfully ran for re-election in 2022, continuing to advocate for policies that benefit her constituents.

Following redistricting, Linda ran for the newly drawn District 13 seat in 2024. Her campaign emphasized her dedication to reducing property taxes, improving school and county infrastructure, and fostering community collaboration.

As a legislator, Linda has been appointed chair of the House Education Committee, where she continues to champion initiatives that support students, educators, and families.
