Kathy Love is a Republican member of the Montana House of Representatives, representing District 85. She assumed office on January 6, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 4, 2027.

Kathy Love has been a dedicated resident of Montana for over three decades, having moved to Ravalli County in 1990. Her journey to public service is deeply rooted in her love for the community and her commitment to upholding conservative values. Before entering politics, Kathy had a long and fulfilling career as a dental hygienist, practicing for 38 years, with 33 of those years spent serving the people of Montana. She retired from her dental career in December 2023, marking the end of one chapter and the beginning of another as she transitioned into public service.

In addition to her professional career, Kathy is an entrepreneur and firearms instructor. She founded Love2Shoot Firearms Training, a business that initially aimed to provide women with firearms training in a supportive environment. Over time, the business grew significantly, attracting both men and women who sought to learn the basics of firearm safety and concealed carry. Kathy is also an accomplished competitive shooter and serves on the board of the Whittecar Rifle and Pistol Range in Hamilton.

Kathy's dedication to the Second Amendment is evident through her involvement with Women For Gun Rights, formerly known as The DC Project. This organization brings together women from all 50 states to advocate for Second Amendment rights at both the state and national levels. Her advocacy work has allowed her to build connections across the country and stay informed about current events and legislative issues.

Family plays a central role in Kathy's life. She is married to Kurt Love, and together they have three children and seven grandchildren. Although her children live in different parts of the country, Kathy cherishes the opportunities to travel and spend time with them.

As a Christian and a Constitutional Conservative, Kathy Love believes in the original intent of the Constitution and the importance of maintaining the separation of powers among the three branches of government. Her values and principles guide her work in the Montana House of Representatives, where she strives to represent the voices and concerns of her constituents in District 85. Through her dedication and service, Kathy Love continues to make a meaningful impact on her community and the state of Montana.
