Daniel P. Troy is the current state representative for Ohio’s 23rd House District, representing the cities of Eastlake, Mentor-on-the-Lake, Richmond Heights, Wickliffe, Willoughby, Willoughby Hills, Willowick, half of Mentor, the villages of Gates Mills, Lakeline, Mayfield, and Timberlake.

Representative Troy previously served seven terms in the Ohio House, where he built a reputation as a bipartisan lawmaker. He served as Chairman of the Ohio House Ways and Means Committee, the Education Subcommittee of the House Finance and Appropriations Committee, and the Joint House-Senate Education Oversight Committee during that tenure.

Rep. Troy is known for reaching across the aisle to pass landmark legislation to improve the lives of Ohio’s working people and families. He has worked on bills that protect and preserve Ohio’s lakes, wildlife and environment, make it easier for Ohio students to graduate on time and with less debt, and grow the state’s economy by investing in communities and creating a pro-worker, pro-growth business environment. He is considered an expert on issues regarding budgeting and taxation, and received numerous awards for his legislative work in many subject areas.

Rep. Troy returned to the Ohio House for an eighth and ninth term by being elected in 2020 & re-elected in 2022. He remains committed to working on commonsense, bipartisan solutions to expand opportunity, grow jobs and invest in Ohio’s future. His priorities include protecting Lake Erie, building back the state’s economy, and fighting for working people, families and local communities of the 23rd House District.

Prior to his tenure at the Statehouse, Troy served five terms as Lake County Commissioner and was elected by his peers in all 88 counties to serve as President of the County Commissioners Association of Ohio in 2008 and again 2018, the first individual to be elected twice to this office. He has also served as a Willowick City Councilmember and Council President.

Rep. Troy was born in Cleveland and has lived in Lake County since he was eight years old. He is a graduate of Cleveland St. Joseph High School and The University of Dayton (B.A. in Political Science). He is a 50-year building trades union member, and a U.S. Army veteran. He has also enjoyed teaching courses on state, local and national government as a part-time faculty member at Lakeland Community College.
