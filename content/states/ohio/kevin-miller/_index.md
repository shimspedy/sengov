State Representative Kevin Miller was elected in November of 2022 to represent the people of the 69th Ohio House District, which encompasses portions of Fairfield, Perry, and Licking counties.

Representative Miller served with the Ohio State Highway Patrol for more than 20 years. Throughout his law enforcement career, he has served as a state trooper, labor relations management advocate, and post commander. Additionally, he served as the legislative liaison for the patrol’s governmental affairs for over four years, which included tracking and testifying on legislation.

He received his bachelor’s degree at Ohio State University and attended a 10-week course for law enforcement executives at the FBI National Academy.

As a lifelong Republican, Rep. Miller has pushed for policies that drive economic growth and job creation. He values conservative principles such as the right to life, the right to bear arms, and freedom from government overreach.

Rep. Miller married his high school sweetheart Megan, and they have been blessed with two children living in the Buckeye State.
