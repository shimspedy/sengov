State Representative Angie King is serving her first term in the Ohio House of Representatives. She represents the 84th House District which includes Mercer County, northern Darke County and southern Auglaize County.

Representative King is a realtor and small business owner who has been involved in buying, selling, and managing real estate for more than 25 years. Raised on a farm, the eldest of five, King’s character was forged by perseverance and a strong work ethic, shaping her into a dedicated individual with a deep sense of community.

Representative King holds a Bachelor of Science in Organizational Leadership and a Master of Business Administration, both from Wright State University. She is a former board member of the Ohio Housing Trust Fund Advisory Committee, West Ohio Community Action Partnership and Ohio Board of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology. King has a strong record of public and community service. She previously served as a Celina City Council member for 11 years and served as the Mercer County Recorder from 2013 until she was elected to the House.

After discovering her infant daughter was deaf, she became a strong advocate for the deaf and hard of hearing at both the state and national level. That experience has opened doors she never imagined. As a ‘mom-on-a-mission,’ she learned how to impact policy and make a difference in the lives of others. She is proud to have played a part in Ohio’s Universal Newborn Hearing Screening legislation. Her persistent and persuasive advocacy prompted the U.S. Department of Education to update its early intervention language in the Individuals with Disability Education Act (IDEA), ensuring that parents receive the full range of options for their deaf or hearing-impaired children, including cochlear implants.

Representative King champions the values of the district. She has consistently advocated for policies that support individual liberty, strong families, small businesses, and the agricultural sector.

Representative King and her husband, Mark, have been married for more than 30 years. They are blessed with two grown children and four grandchildren. For over three decades, their family, spanning four generations, has been a dedicated part of their local church.
