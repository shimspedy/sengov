Dr. Anita Somani is currently serving her first term as State Representative for Ohio�s 11th House District, which includes the cities of Dublin and Hilliard.

For the last 31 years, Dr. Somani has worked in Columbus as a highly respected healthcare professional, currently as an OBGYN at OhioHealth. She earned her M.D. from the Medical College of Ohio and completed her residency in OB/GYN at Mt. Carmel Medical Center in Columbus. In addition to practicing medicine, she serves as a Co-Chair of the Physicians Action Network and as the State Director for South Asians for America. She is also a board member of the Columbus Medical Association and Planned Parenthood of Central Ohio.

Dr. Somani ran for office because she believes the state of Ohio has gone down the wrong path regarding prominent issues such as health care, increasing abortion restrictions and the loosening of gun laws, all of which disproportionately affect marginalized communities. As a physician and legislator, she looks forward to using her medical background to improve the public health of our state and to create evidence-based legislation that helps everyone in our community. Her priorities include working for quality and affordable health care, sensible gun legislation, and fully investing in public education so that every child has the tools needed to succeed.

Dr. Somani lives in Columbus with her husband where they raised their two children. She is a first-generation immigrant from India, and her father was the first Asian to serve in a Governor�s cabinet. On a personal level, she has completed 10 half marathons and still enjoys running. She is an avid reader, and one of her biggest stress reducers is baking.
