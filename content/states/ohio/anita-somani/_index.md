Dr. Anita Somani is currently serving her first term as State Representative for Ohio’s 11th House District, which includes the cities of Dublin and Hilliard. She is running for re-election in District 8 which encompasses Worthington and parts of Dublin and Columbus.

For the last 32 years, Dr. Somani has worked in Columbus as a highly respected healthcare professional, currently as an OBGYN at OhioHealth.  She earned her M.D. from the Medical College of Ohio and completed her residency in OB/GYN at Mt. Carmel Medical Center in Columbus. She has her certification in Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery( MIGS). Dr. Somani is a past board member of the Columbus Medical Association and Planned Parenthood. She is currently a Board Member of LEAD Ohio. 

Dr. Somani ran for office because she believes the state of Ohio has gone down the wrong path regarding prominent issues such as health care, increasing abortion restrictions and the loosening of gun laws, all of which disproportionately affect marginalized communities. As a physician and legislator, she has used her medical background to improve the public health of our state and to create evidence-based legislation that helps everyone in our community.  She serves on the Health Policy, Health Providers, Families & Aging and Insurance Committees. She is the ranking member on Health Providers. She has sponsored many health related bills including the Reproductive Care Act (HB343), the Protect IVF technology(HB502) and the funding of Crisis Pregnancy Centers(HB565). She strongly believes in the separation of church and state. Public school funding should not go to school vouchers. 

Dr. Somani lives in Columbus with her husband where they raised their son, an engineer and their daughter, an OB/GYN. She is a first-generation immigrant from India, and her father was the first Asian to serve in a Governor’s cabinet. On a personal level, she has completed 10 half marathons and still enjoys running. She is an avid reader and one of her biggest stress reducers is baking.
