Senator Nathan Manning is serving his second term in the Ohio Senate representing the people of the 13th Senate District, which includes all of Lorain County and portions of Erie and Huron counties. He was elected to the Senate after serving two terms in the Ohio House of Representatives. He also previously served as prosecutor for the city of North Ridgeville and currently a partner at the law firm Manning & Manning with his sister, Allison.

After graduating from North Ridgeville High School, Senator Manning received his bachelor’s degree in Political Science from Denison University and earned his Juris Doctor from Capital University Law School.

Senator Manning has spent his time in the legislature focused on several substantial issues that are meaningful to his constituents. In 2022, he led the effort to pass major criminal justice reform legislation that both enhances public safety and provides pathways for second chances. For his work on Senate Bill 288, Senator Manning was named the Alliance of Safety and Justice Champion of the Year, and he also earned the Ohio Community Corrections Association’s President’s Award.

Senator Manning has sponsored legislation to create stroke patient protocols for emergency medical services to ensure all Ohioans can receive life-saving care. During the 131st General Assembly, the Senator worked on “Kevin’s Law,” which expanded emergency prescription refills for life-saving medications. The Senator also helped establish Aortic Aneurysm Awareness Day on February 13 to honor his late father and educate the public on early detection of the condition.

A lifelong resident of Lorain County, Senator Manning is active in his community and involved in several organizations including the North Ridgeville and Lorain County Chambers of Commerce, Lorain County Bar Association and previously served as a board member of the Genesis House in Elyria. -
