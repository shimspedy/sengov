State Senator Al Cutrona is serving in the Ohio Senate following his appointment in 2024. He represents the 33rd Ohio Senate District, which encompasses Mahoning, Columbiana and Carroll counties.

Prior to joining the Senate, Cutrona served in the Ohio House for two terms. During his time as state representative, he accomplished several milestones, including passing the most bills out of the House chamber during his first year. He also chaired the Health Provider Services Committee and sponsored House Bill 2, the $3 billion state capital budget that helped fund several local community projects.

He is a proud graduate of Canfield High School, and he earned his bachelor’s degree in Political Science and History from Youngstown State University (YSU), where he graduated cum laude. During college he was a representative of the Student Government Association and member of the Academic Affairs Committee. He then attended law school and earned his J.D. from Case Western Reserve University School of Law, where he earned a leadership scholarship.

He has held a position as the Chief Operating Officer for a large tri-county infectious disease medical practice. The infectious disease medical practice covers Mahoning, Trumbull and Columbiana counties.

Additionally, he has held several other positions at law offices throughout his professional career. While in law school, he clerked for the Honorable Gene Donofrio of the Ohio Seventh District Court of Appeals and held an externship for the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Ohio in the Civil Division. 

Currently, Cutrona is a practicing attorney with a focus in healthcare, business, and bankruptcy law. 

He is a former Board of Trustees for Organizacion Civica y Cultural Hispana Americana (OCCHA). Cutrona remains active in his community celebrating both his Puerto Rican and Italian heritage and is a member of St. Anthony’s of Padua/Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Youngstown, Ohio.
