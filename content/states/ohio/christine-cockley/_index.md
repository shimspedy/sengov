State Representative Christine Cockley is a proud West Sider serving her first term in the Ohio House of Representatives, representing District 6. Representative Cockley was born and raised in Mansfield, Ohio, and moved to Columbus where she graduated from The Ohio State University. Representative Cockley has her Bachelor of Arts and Master of Public Administration from The Ohio State Universityâ€™s John Glenn College of Public Affairs. She is ready to work alongside her community to accomplish the shared goals and overcome any challenges experienced by those living in District 6 which includes the Columbus Westside, Franklin Township, Prairie Township, Valleyview, and parts of Norwich Township.

Prior to joining the Legislature, Representative Cockley worked in the nonprofit sector. Most recently, she was the Executive Assistant to the President & CEO of YWCA Columbus, a Board Member for Highland Youth Garden, and the Director of Development for Moderation Management, an organization that seeks to support those who wish to change their relationship with alcohol consumption. Having previously worked for U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown and his re-election campaign, Representative Cockley has learned the importance of actively listening to community members and taking decisive action to get concrete results. She is committed to being a strong advocate for her constituents, making sure their voices are heard and their needs are met in the General Assembly. With a background in nonprofit administration and governance, human resources, campaigning, and government affairs, she brings a wealth of experience to her role. 

In the 136th General Assembly, Representative Cockley will prioritize enhancing health care access, lowering the cost of housing, and funding reliable infrastructure. She believes every Ohioan deserves to thrive with safe, secure neighborhoods, affordable housing, a job that pays a living wage, and an education that is second to none. She intends to uphold the values of all Ohioans while working across the aisle where possible to deliver tangible results for District 6. 

In addition to her public service work, Representative Cockley enjoys spending time with her husband, dogs, and chickens as well as gardening, and reading. She lives on the Hilltop, a Columbus Westside neighborhood with her husband.
