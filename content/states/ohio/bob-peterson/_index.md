State Representative Bob Peterson is currently serving his first term as State Representative for the 91st Ohio House District, which includes all of Fayette, Highland and Pike Counties and western Ross County.

As a farmer, business owner and former county official, Bob Peterson has devoted much of his time and attention to solving the challenges facing our communities. He now brings that same attitude and drive to the Ohio House as he works to improve all of Ohio. He previously served as President Pro Tempore of the Ohio Senate during the 133rd and 132nd General Assembly.

Representative Peterson and his brother are the 8th generation of Petersons to farm in the United States. Peterson raises corn, soybeans, wheat and livestock on his family’s farm. He also has been active in the Farm Bureau holding a variety of leadership positions, culminating in his service as the Ohio Farm Bureau President for nearly five years.

In addition to his farming duties, Representative Peterson served as a Fayette County Commissioner for 14 years before being elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 2011. He joined the Ohio Senate in 2012, where his knowledge and leadership have earned him a seat at the table on the issues that matter most to the communities he serves.

Representative Peterson has received numerous awards for his efforts in the Statehouse, including the Watchdog of the Treasury award, the Ohio Farm Bureau Friend of Agriculture, the NFIB Guardian of Small Business and the Nature Conservancy’s commitment to improving Ohio’s water quality award.

Peterson received his bachelor’s degree from The Ohio State University.

Representative Peterson and his wife Lisa are the proud parents of three adult children. They live on their farm in Fayette County. They are active in church, 4-H, FFA, and other community activities.
