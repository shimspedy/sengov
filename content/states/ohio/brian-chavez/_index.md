Senator Brian Chavez serves the people of Washington, Athens, Belmont, Meigs, Morgan, Monroe, Noble, Harrison and Jefferson counties, and part of Guernsey County. He was appointed to represent the people of the 30th Senate District in December of 2023.

Born and raised in New Mexico, Senator Chavez earned a degree in Chemical Engineering and then joined Intel Corporation making computer chips. There he met his wife Christy, an Industrial Engineer and the safety manager of the Intel manufacturing facility. They later decided to change career paths after 14 years and move to Christyâ€™s hometown in Ohio to raise their two boys.

Senator Chavez has been involved in a family oil and gas business that had its beginnings more than 50 years ago. Along with his wife, Chavez is the manager and owner of Reno Oil & Gas, LLC, which manages the operations and field maintenance of more than 400 conventional gas and oil wells. He is also the owner of Chavez Well Service, LLC. Chavez and his wife are the recipients of the Marietta Area Chamber of Commerce Business Leaders of the Year award (2017).

Prior to his appointment to the Senate, Chavez was a member of the Oil and Gas Commission. He was appointed by the governor to the quasi-judicial board designed to resolve disputes between the Ohio Division of Natural Resources and operators of oil and gas wells. Senator Chavez also previously served as a trustee for the Ohio Oil and Gas Association (OOGA) and on the executive committee of that organization for more than a decade. Chavez was on the board of Southeast Ohio Oil and Gas Association (SOOGA) for nearly 10 years and served as its president. Additionally, he is the former Vice-Chair of the Ohio Oil Natural Energy Institute (ONEi), where he was active in the communications and scholarship committees.

Senator Chavez lives in Marietta, Ohio, with his wife Christy, his two sons Bryson and Carson, and their three beloved pets. He is active in his Marietta area community and is a consultant on a weekly Oil and Gas Industry radio show that can be heard on five radio stations.
