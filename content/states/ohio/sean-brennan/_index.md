State Representative Sean Patrick Brennan has dedicated his life to public service. He firmly believes that his story informs his calling to public service and proves that the American Dream survives. After his father abandoned his family, his strong mother modeled the importance of family and the satisfaction of a hard day's work, making their trailer a home and utilizing public assistance only as needed. Sadly, his mother later suffered through an abusive relationship. As a result, Rep. Brennan was blessed when his loving grandmother took him in to help tend the family farm and focus on his studies.

Brennan went on to attend the University of Dayton where he graduated summa cum laude earning a Bachelor's Degree in International Studies concentrating in Russian and Soviet Studies. While there, he fell in love with Deena Denk from Parma, where they currently reside and raised their two beautiful children. He has also completed graduate-level coursework in history, political science, economics, and pedagogy at several colleges and universities and has a Master's Degree in Secondary School Administration from Cleveland State University. Brennan's scholarly activities involve projects on the subjects of the U.S. Constitution, religious freedom in America, and various other American political and historical topics at George Washington's Mount Vernon, James Madison's Montpelier, Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, the University of Oxford in England, George Washington University in Washington, D.C., the Bill of Rights Institute in Arlington, Virginia, and the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University.

Brennan served as an award-winning public school teacher for three decades, as well as a Parma councilman for nearly two decades, including over a decade as the at-large elected President of Council and the Public Housing Board of Ohio's 7th largest city. He is active in civic, professional, and charitable organizations, which include founder and board member of the Andrew Boyko Scholarship Foundation, St. Charles Borromeo Parish lector and adult server, Friends of Parma Libraries life member, founder of the Parma Peanut Butter Drive benefitting All Faiths Pantry, founder and past adviser of the Parma Youth Commission, advisory board member of Big Creek Connects, member of West Creek Conservancy, Parma Historical Society, the City Club of Cleveland, German Central Foundation, National Education Association, Ohio Education Association and Northeast Ohio Education Association.

An avid runner and advocate of healthy living, Brennan has completed 110 marathons, as well as countless other smaller running events. His love of running led to his creation of the annual Parma Run-Walk for Pierogies, which has raised thousands of dollars for local charities. Among other projects, his charitable work led to the creation of the script Parma sign which was subsequently donated to the City of Parma and adorns Anthony Zielinski Park and raising thousands of dollars to assist residents whose incomes were negatively impacted by the pandemic.
