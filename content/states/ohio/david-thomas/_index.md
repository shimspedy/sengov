State Representative David Thomas is serving his first term in the Ohio House of Representatives. He represents the 65th Ohio House District, which includes portions of Ashtabula and Trumbull counties.  In addition to serving as Vice Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, Thomas serves on the Energy, Personal Insurance and Pensions, and Arts, Athletics and Tourism committees. 

A lifelong resident of Ashtabula County, Thomas served on Austinburg Township’s zoning board at the age of 16, easing zoning regulations on business. As a college student at Washington and Lee University in Virginia, he worked in state and federal government positions, including in the Columbus Statehouse, in the United State House of Representatives, and for the Republican National Committee in Washington, D.C. Yet, he chose to return to Ashtabula County after graduation in 2015 because he wanted to play a role in the future success of the community. 

Prior to being elected Ashtabula County Auditor in 2018, Thomas was the Fiscal Officer for Austinburg Township beginning in 2015 and was employed full time at Grand River Academy and received his Master of Business Administration (MBA) at Baldwin Wallace University in 2018.

David is a product of Ashtabula and Trumbull Counties. He has deep roots in Trumbull County as his grandparents and extended family live in the 65th District and he spent much of his childhood and time today on his family’s farm and in Cortland. “I’ve been blessed with a family focused on service,” said Thomas. “My grandma Diana Marchese served Trumbull for 24 years as Recorder, my grandfather Dominic Marchese has been a Township Trustee and leader in agriculture, my other grandfather Ron Thomas gave his career to Delphi and Packard helping many workers in that plant and my grandmother Rosann Thomas devoted herself to their church and family.”

He was active in 4H in his youth and contributes much of his success to his community upbringing and family walk with God. 

Thomas was a coalition leader for the Ohioans for Payday Loan Reform and 2016 Ashtabula County LEADERship Graduate.

He also served as a Past President of the Geneva Rotary Club, After School Discovery, Ashtabula County Continued Education Support Services (ACCESS), Ashtabula County Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO), Past President of the Conneaut Lions Club, and is a member of the Paul Demshar Foundation and Jefferson Church of the Nazarene. He is a recipient of the 2017 Top 5 Under 45 Award for Ashtabula County and 2019 and 2022 Partner of the Year from the Ashtabula County Board of REALTORS.
