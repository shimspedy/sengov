State Representative Dave Dobos is currently serving his first term as State Representative for the 10th Ohio House District, which encompasses portions of the west, southwest, and south sides of Columbus, Grove City, Urbancrest, and most of Franklin Township.  He intends to concentrate his legislative efforts on issues related to economic growth, workforce development, and quality K-12 education.

A graduate of West High School, Dobos used his education and training to start a small business.  His current company, among other services, provides SAT and ACT preparation for high school students and has helped ready thousands of students for a bright future in Ohio and beyond.

Rep. Dobos is very active in his community. He has held leadership roles in multiple organizations, including being elected twice to the Columbus City School Board, where he served as President.  During his time there, he helped enact innovative policies and budgets that increased graduation rates by 12%, tripled the number of students enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) classes, increased test scores, ended forced busing with student school assignments based on access and choice, and eliminated many central office administrators.

In addition to his service on the school board, he has served as president of the Hilltop Business Association, Hilltop Historical Society, and West High School Alumni Association.

Dobos also attended MIT, where he served as class president and was a student athlete.  He received the Karl Taylor Compton Prize for his outstanding contributions to the MIT Community. He has also served on the Board of Directors for the MIT Alumni Association.

Rep. Dobos lives in Columbus, and has two adult sons, Joseph and Alex.  In his free time, Dobos enjoys classical music and plays the violin.
