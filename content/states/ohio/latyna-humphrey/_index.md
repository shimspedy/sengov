Representative Latyna M. Humphrey was born in Columbus, Ohio and attended Columbus East High School. She earned an Associate of Arts degree from Columbus State Community College and attended Franklin University and sought a Bachelor of Science in applied psychology from Franklin University.

She has dedicated her career to uplifting people in poverty and making our community more equitable for everyone. Community service is not new to Rep. Humphrey as she helped with aid during the Flint Water Crisis. There, she volunteered to help with data entry for the American Red Cross and served at local food kitchens. This experience led her to get involved here in Columbus with local organizations such as the YWCA, YMCA, Central Ohio Young Black Democrats, NAACP-Columbus and the Franklin County Democratic Party where she serves as Secretary of the Central Committee.

In 2019, Rep. Humphrey became the Community Outreach Coordinator for Franklin County Auditor, Michael Stinziano. Later, she joined the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas as Bailiff to the Honorable Judge Carl A. Aveni, II. In addition, Rep. Humphrey is a two-time author and has been featured in multiple national publications and was guest speaker at Columbia University, The Ohio State University, the National Society of Leadership and Success, Brooklyn College, Hampton University and many others.
