State Representative Joe Miller is a proud resident of Lorain County. Having graduated from Marion L. Steele High School in Amherst, he attended Lorain County Community College for two years while working full time before transferring to Bowling Green State University to complete his Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education. Since then, he went on to obtain two graduate degrees from Ashland University, a Masters of Education and a Master of Arts in American History and Government.

Before entering the General Assembly, Representative Miller worked in both the public and private sectors. After a short time teaching and coaching in Texas, he returned to Ohio and joined a design build firm and became an Associate Director of Planning. It was this and time spent as a general manager in a print production office that gave him valuable insight into the challenges that face businesses here in Ohio.

September 11th  inspired Rep Miller to return to the classroom where he has taught courses at both the high school and college level. In addition to being an active USGTF Professional Golf Instructor and OHSAA Basketball Official, Representative Miller enjoys volunteering in his community and church. He and his wife Kelly, who is a fellow educator, currently reside in Amherst with their two sons, Joseph and Jordan and bulldog, Heisman.

Before being elected to the 133rd GA, he served on the Amherst Board of Zoning Appeals and as an At-Large Councilman for six years. In his freetime, he can be found at his boys' sporting events or on family vacations.

State Representative Joe Miller is a passionate advocate for quality education, jobs for hardworking Ohioans, opportunities for green energy expansion, and assistance to our veterans.

As a former educator, Representative Miller understands the vital role that schools have in inspiring our future generations of leaders, innovators, and creative thinkers. In order to invest in our children’s future, he believes we must implement a new school funding model that is both constitutional and equitable, while also allowing our local stakeholders, school boards, teachers, and parents to have a say in their child’s education.

Throughout his first term as State Representative of the 56th Ohio House District, he introduced and supported legislation to bring money and jobs back to Lorain County, increase incentives for renewable green energy, provide assistance and recognition to our veterans and nation’s heroes, and restore local control in the Lorain City School District. Through investment in our children, renewable energy, and innovative technology, Representative Miller believes in the potential of Ohio to lead the nation in job creation and sustainability, while being a great place to work and raise a family.
