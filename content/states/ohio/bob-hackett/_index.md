Senator Bob Hackett currently represents all of Clark, Clinton and Greene Counties. Bob is a lifelong resident of the district where he attended London High School and served as Captain of the undefeated football team. This achievement earned Bob All-League and All-State Honors, which led to his recent induction into the London High School Sports Hall of Fame. Bob continued his education at Columbia University, where he received his B.A. in Economics; earned All-Ivy Honors in football and was awarded top scholar of the football team. Following college, Bob returned to the district and worked in agriculture for six years and then began his career in the financial services industry – becoming the founder of Central Ohio Financial Management Group LLC, where he has remained for the past twenty six years.

Having served as a Madison County Commissioner and now in the Ohio Senate, he has enacted safeguards to preserve rural traditions which are important to the region. As a County Commissioner, Bob was successful in incorporating zoning system changes, which created a comprehensive plan which preserves agriculture. This plan is highly praised throughout the state and currently serves as a role model for other counties.  In addition, Bob worked to successfully attract new industry to the region and further created solutions which avoided increases in local taxes. Bob was a driving force behind the County Employee Benefits Consortium of Ohio (CEBCO), which through competitive bargaining has saved participating and non-participating counties thousands of dollars toward their healthcare costs.   

As a State Senator serving his first term, Bob’s priorities are to stimulate the economic growth of our state, exercise fiscal responsibility, lessen the tax burden on our citizens and maintain jobs. Currently, Bob serves as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Insurance; and as a member of the Agriculture and Natural Resources, Financial Institutions and Technology, Veterans and Public Safety, and Rules and Reference Committees. Furthermore, Bob has achieved a perfect attendance voting record.

Bob has served in numerous leadership roles, including positions with the Madison County Hospital; Choctaw Lake Property Owners Association; Madison County Farmland Preservation Task Force; the Entrepreneurship Institute of Ohio; Watchdog of the Treasury and is currently a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).  Bob supports many community organizations, including The Mercator Club; The Madison County Hospital Foundation; Madison County Historical Society; Madison County Friends of the Park; Madison County Chapter of National Association of Mental Illness (NAMI) and A Friend’s House – a local domestic violence shelter.

Bob’s election to the Ohio Senate is a culmination of his political and professional experiences.  Bob is a member of Saint Patrick’s Parish in London, and most importantly to him are his wife of more than 25 years, Sue, their son, Seth, daughter-in-law Lauren and his granddaughter, Preslee.
