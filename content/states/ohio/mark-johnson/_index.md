State Representative Mark Johnson is currently serving his second term as State Representative for the 92nd Ohio house district, which includes all of Hocking and Vinton Counties, southern Perry County, and Ross County from Chillicothe east.

Rep. Johnson formerly was the Business Manager for the Tri-State Building and Construction Trades Council. Prior to serving as Business Manager, he served as Construction Superintendent for a large Columbus-area contractor, where he remained for 17 years. Fun fact: Rep. Johnson was actually a working carpenter for the Vern Riffe Center, where he and his colleagues at the House now work.

Rep. Johnson is proud to reside in Ohio’s first capitol, Chillicothe. He appreciates the rich history of his hometown. He and his wife Kelli attend St. Mary’s church, where they both serve as co-chairs of the Social Concerns Committee. Rep. Johnson is also an active member of the Knights of Columbus, the First Capitol Rotary, and a lifelong Building Trades member. He also serves as a member of both the Chillicothe and Hocking County Chambers of Commerce. Rep. Johnson is a proud grandson of a West Virginia coal miner, and in his spare time, he enjoys taking his Harley Davidson out for road trips.
