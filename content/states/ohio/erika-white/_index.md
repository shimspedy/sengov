Erika White is a committed worker and advocate for both the working and middle class and a devoted mother who understands the necessity of government that prioritizes the voices and addresses the needs of all its citizens. 

While working at AT&T, formally known as Ohio Bell, Erika served as both the Vice President & President of her local chapter, CWA 4319. During this time, she also served as a member of the CWA National Executive Board-Diversity Board At-Large Member where she advocated for workers both locally and nationally, demonstrating trust and leadership among her peers. As Vice President of the Greater Northwest Ohio (GNWO) AFL-CIO, Erika works tirelessly to promote workers' rights, championing fair wages and safe working conditions.  Her commitment to civic engagement was highlighted in 2024 when she was elected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.

Erika has been actively involved in organizations that focus on improving public health and advancing worker equity. As both the Chair and Vice Chair of the Healthy Lucas County Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), she has been at the forefront of initiatives that enhance the health and well-being of her community. Her role on the Lucas County Mental Health & Recovery Services Executive Board highlights her strong commitment to addressing mental health and ensuring that individuals are able to reach their fullest potential. As the Health Chair for the Toledo NAACP, Rep. White worked to dismantle health disparities that affect marginalized communities.

Erika is focused on creating a balanced economy that not only stimulates sustainable economic growth to all sectors but also supports Ohio workers equitably. She is passionately dedicated to building an Ohio where every individual, regardless of their background, socioeconomic status, or personal challenges, has access to the American Dream, just as she was fortunate enough to experience. She actively advocates for quality healthcare where every person has the opportunity to access the medical care they need—be it preventative services, emergency care, or ongoing treatment—without the burden of financial strain, thereby fostering a healthier and more equitable Ohio for all.

"The chance to change anyone's life is simply creating a harbor where opportunity meets hard work. For me, that opportunity was my union, and that hard work was taught by my mother and fostered through public education. If we want better outcomes, we must equitably invest resources that create realistic opportunities for all Ohioans."
