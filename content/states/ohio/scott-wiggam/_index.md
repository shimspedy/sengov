Representative Scott Wiggam is currently serving his fourth term as state representative for the 77th Ohio House District, which encompasses all of Wayne County.

As a three-term Wayne County Commissioner, he worked toward a limited, more effective local government, reducing local government spending while increasing services.  He fulfilled his promises to the people of Wayne County through economic development initiatives, pro-agricultural policies, and conservative values.

Prior to his tenure as commissioner, Representative Wiggam owned and operated a restaurant with 20 employees. He earned a bachelor’s degree from Asbury College and a master’s degree in Political Science from the University of Akron.   During Scott’s four year, active duty tour in the United States Air Force, he was honored with an Air Force Commendation Medal for meritorious service.

Representative Wiggam and his wife Katie reside in Wooster. They have three children together.
