Representative Lauren McNally is a practical and selfless leader, representing Ohio’s 59th district which includes parts of Mahoning and Columbiana counties. The district also includes a substantial amount of the City of Youngstown, where Representative McNally served as the 5th Ward Councilwoman from 2016-2022, concentrating on economic development, neighborhood improvements and infrastructure investment. She is a graduate of Ursuline High School, and continued her education at The Ohio State University and Miami University, earning degrees in Political Science and Journalism. She has worked around the country as a journalist for various local NPR stations and other print media outlets as well as various consulting firms as a Marketing Specialist.

Alongside her family, Representative McNally is often quick to step up and give her time generously to lighten the load and enrich the lives of others. A mother of four, she is active in her community, having served on several community boards including the American Red Cross and Women’s Junior League of Youngstown. Her husband, Breen McNally, is a staff representative for AFSCME Ohio Council 8. His father, Jerome McNally, also served the 5th Ward on Youngstown City Council and in other various public positions for two decades.

Representative McNally’s family values stem from a strong sense of duty and a legacy of service to others.  Her Grandfathers were both World War II veterans. Her maternal grandfather is famed longtime Principal and legendary high school football coach at Ursuline High School, Tom Carey, while her paternal grandfather was a lifelong union millworker and Romanian native who helped several others immigrate to the United States. Representative McNally knows firsthand how educators and good union wages and benefits can strengthen communities.

No matter your family’s interests or makeup, Representative McNally wants you to thrive. Education initiatives, traditional or alternative, as well as workforce initiatives that create opportunities for Mahoning Valley, were strong motivators in her decision to run for the statehouse. She intends to find practical solutions to these and other issues, such as public corruption and local government funding, while representing us in Columbus. Representative McNally will be a hardworking and accessible lawmaker whose office is open to you.
