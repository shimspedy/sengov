Representative Lauren McNally is a committed and results-driven leader, proudly serving Ohio’s 58th District, which includes much of Mahoning County and the entire City of Youngstown. Before joining the Ohio House, she represented Youngstown’s 5th Ward on City Council from 2016 to 2022, where she focused on economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and infrastructure improvements.

A graduate of Ursuline High School, Representative McNally earned degrees in Political Science and Journalism from The Ohio State University and Miami University. She built a diverse career as a journalist, reporting for NPR stations and print media across the country, and later worked as a Marketing Specialist for various consulting firms.

Beyond public service, Representative McNally is deeply involved in her community. A devoted mother of four, she understands the importance of strong families and thriving neighborhoods. She has served on several local boards, including the American Red Cross and the Junior League of Youngstown. Her husband, Breen McNally, advocates for workers' rights as a staff representative for AFSCME Ohio Council 8, following a family tradition of public service—his father, Jerome McNally, was a longtime Youngstown City Councilman.

Public service runs deep in Representative McNally’s roots. Her grandfathers were both World War II veterans, and her maternal grandfather, Tom Carey, was a legendary high school principal and football coach at Ursuline High School. Her paternal grandfather, a Romanian immigrant and lifelong union millworker, dedicated himself to helping others build better lives in the United States. These experiences instilled in her a deep respect for education, organized labor, and community strength.

Representative McNally is passionate about ensuring all families—no matter their background—have the tools they need to succeed. She is a strong advocate for education and workforce initiatives that create meaningful opportunities for the Mahoning Valley. Addressing public corruption and securing fair funding for local governments are also central to her legislative priorities.

Now in her second term, she continues to serve as the Ranking Member of the Commerce & Labor Committee, where she remains a steadfast voice for workers’ rights and employee protections.

Representative McNally is a hardworking, accessible lawmaker who is always ready to listen and fight for the people she serves. Her office is open to you.
