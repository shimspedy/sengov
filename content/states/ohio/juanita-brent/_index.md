Representative Brent is in her third term as a legislator and is honored to continue representing and fighting for the people of District 22.

In the 133rd General Assembly, Representative Brent authored House Bill 285, Establish Driver's License Reinstatement Fee Debt Reduction Program. This bill became law in 2020, and now helps thousands of Ohioans have a pathway to removing suspended driver's licenses.

Currently, she serves as Ranking Member of the Agriculture Committee, while also sitting on Energy and Natural Resources, Commerce and Labor, Homeland Security, and Transportation Committees. In addition, she is the First Vice-President of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, which is the oldest Black Caucus in the nation.

In all of these spaces, she works to introduce legislation that prioritizes justice and equity including: adult-use cannabis, the C.R.O.W.N (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) Act, the Kinship Care Bill of Rights, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, Juneteenth as a paid holiday, and many more.

Prior to becoming a legislator, Representative Brent sat on the board of trustees for the Harvard Community Services Center and the Lee-Harvard Community Development Corporation. She brings this experience of building and organizing strong communities to her work in Columbus.

In her free time, she enjoys visiting family and taking vacations by herself.
