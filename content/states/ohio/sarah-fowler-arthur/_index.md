State Representative Sarah Fowler Arthur is currently serving her second term in the Ohio House of Representatives. She represents the 99th House District, which encompasses northern Ashtabula County and northern Geauga County.

Prior to being elected to the House, Fowler Arthur has served on the Ohio State Board of Education since 2013. Sarah has supported parental direction of children’s education and local control of Ohio’s public schools throughout her tenure. She is the first homeschool graduate in the nation to be elected to a State Board of Education.

Sarah has served on more than a dozen State Board of Education committees and several workgroups, which has given her a wide range of education policy experience. She was the State Board’s 2015 appointee to the National Association of State Boards of Education workgroup on Governmental Affairs that focused on federal education law and policy. Sarah has also served as vice-chairman for three committees (2014-2018) and was the chairman of the Teaching, Leading, and Learning Committee from 2019-2020.

A small business owner, Sarah started her first business when she was just eleven years old, operating “Sarah’s Eggs” for thirteen years. A former independent consultant with Lilla Rose, Norwex, Plexus, and Young Living, she enjoys providing quality products and services to her customers. In 2018, Sarah started her newest entrepreneurial endeavor, Badger Run Berries, LLC, a developing u-pick blueberry farm in Rock Creek.

In her spare time, Sarah has taught hands-on skills such as canning and sewing to small classes of adults and children in both the United States and Mexico. Since 2015, she has enjoyed teaching beginning and intermediate piano to over fifty students ages five to eighteen. In addition to pursuing her entrepreneurial interests, Sarah was Director of Sales and Marketing for Fowler Enterprises, Inc until her marriage in April 2020.

Sarah and her husband currently reside in Geneva-on-the-Lake where they co-produce the international YouTube channel 'Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur.'  She enjoys reading, writing, gardening, camping and hiking. Sarah credits her parents and grandparents for instilling in her the valuable life lessons of hard work, respect, loyalty and love for God and others.
