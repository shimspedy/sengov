State Senator Steve Wilson is currently serving his second term in the Ohio Senate, representing all or part of Warren and Hamilton counties. Wilson was previously appointed in 2017 to fill a vacancy in the 7th Senate District.

An Ohio native and long-time Warren County resident, Senator Steve Wilson has built a career of dedicated service to both his community and his profession. From the time he was honorably discharged as a Naval Officer in 1975, Senator Wilson focused his efforts on an entry-level position at Lebanon Citizens National Bank (LCNB) and public service in his community. Over four decades later, Wilson is the retired CEO of LCNB Corp. and LCNB National Bank. To this day, he continues to proudly serve as Chairman of the board.

Senator Wilson has always sought to give back to the community, making it a better place to live, work and raise a family. He believes that quality education and schools, as well as responsible community planning and creating good-paying jobs, are the tenets to growing a strong living and working environment for all Ohioans.

Known for his thoughtful approach to achieving effective policy change, Wilson isnâ€™t afraid to tackle the complex issues. His willingness to listen and immerse himself in learning all sides of an issue has served him well in the Ohio Senate, as is evidenced by the various positions he has held.

Senator Wilson and his wife, Jill, live in Maineville. They have four children and five grandchildren and are active members of the Otterbein United Methodist Church.
