During her time in state government, Manning has had the opportunity to utilize her extensive experience as an educator, as well as her understanding of local governments and small businesses, to champion and support numerous bills and initiatives. In the Senate, she served as Vice Chair of the Finance Committee, responsible for vetting the operating budget, which allocates funding for the state, including for schools and various projects in communities across Ohio.
