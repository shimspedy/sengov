Mike has long respected the laws of the state of Ohio' both how they are made, and how they are enforced. After graduating cum laude with a Bachelor's Degree in business and political science from Walsh College, he earned his law degree from Cleveland Marshall College of Law.

Upon graduation from law school, Mike served as Assistant Ohio Attorney General under Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze, Jr. He provided legal representation to the Director of Health and appeared before many administrative agencies and state and federal courts.

Between 1989 and 1999, Mike served as a hearing officer for the Ohio Department of Health, presiding over nearly 300 cases of resident abuse and rights violations in nursing homes. He also started a private practice that continues today, representing consumers.

Mike has turned the bulk of his attention, though, to public service. He represented the people of Lakewood as Councilman at Large between 1998 and 2002. He also served as chairman of the Council's Rules and Ordinances Committee, and he was a member of the Finance, Housing and Public Works Committees.

At the Statehouse, Mike has advocated for greater consumer protection, affordable prescription drugs and utility costs, preserving the environment, economic opportunities for working families and the poor, universal health care and the development of Ohio's renewable energy resources. He played a key role in crafting the 2007-2008 state budget that passed with just one dissenting vote.

The Ohio Environmental Council recognized him as its 2004 Environmental Legislator of the Year. He has also received a Special Award of Recognition from the Ohio Primary Care Association for his advocacy for Ohio's community health centers, the 2007 Legislative Champion of Children Award from the American Academy of Pediatrics and Voices for Ohio Children, and the 2007 Legislator of the Year award from the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers.

Back in the 13th House District, Mike serves on the Lakewood Chamber of Commerce, the Lakewood Democratic Club and the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party. He is a former member of the Board of Trustees of the Barton Senior Center and Westerly Senior Apartments in Lakewood and the Lakewood Jaycees, where he served as president in 1999. Mike was honored by the citizens of Ohio's 10th Congressional District to serve as an alternate delegate to the 2000 Democratic Convention in Los Angeles.

Mike previously served four terms in the Ohio House before moving on to serve as State Senator for Ohio's 23rd District in 2010. He returns to the House motivated to work across the aisle ensuring children and families have access to affordable healthcare and live in a clean and safe environment.
