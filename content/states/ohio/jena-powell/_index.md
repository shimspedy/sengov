State Representative Jena Powell is serving her third term in the Ohio House of Representatives. She represents the 80th District, which encompasses Miami County and the southern portion of Darke County.

Powell is from southern Darke County where her family has been farming for generations. After graduating with a degree in Business from Liberty University, Powell started a business in the district. Powell founded and leads the Ohio House Pro-Life Caucus and advocates for policies that will promote healthy families, small businesses, and thriving communities in Ohio. In 2019, Representative Powell was named to the prestigious Forbes 30 Under 30 list for Law & Policy.

Representative Powell is dedicated to ensuring that more of Ohioâ€™s young people choose to build their lives and pursue opportunities in communities like the 80th District.
