State Representative Kevin Ritter is currently serving his first term in the Ohio House of Representatives. He represents the 94th House District, which consists of Washington and Meigs Counties, as well as ten of the fourteen townships in Athens County.

Rep. Ritter attended Central Michigan University on a baseball scholarship and graduated in 1990 with a double major in History and Political Science. He remained at CMU and completed an M.A. degree in Political Science in 1992.

After three years of working in private business in Washington (DC), Kevin attended Western Michigan University to pursue a PhD. in Modern European History. Shortly before graduation he founded a successful sports marketing company – Coast to Coast Athletics – and he left the University.

Rep. Ritter moved to Washington County, Ohio in 2000 with his wife, Khadine. For the next 20 years he ran his business and taught History and American Government at Ohio Valley University, Marietta College, Washington State College, and Veritas Classical Academy, a PreK – 12th school he co-founded.

A popular public speaker, he has given hundreds of public lectures on a variety of topics all around the region. In the fall of 2018, Ritter was elected as a Washington County Commissioner, a position he held until taking office as the new State Representative for the 94th House District in January 2025.

Rep. Ritter and his wife have two children, Liam and Anna.
