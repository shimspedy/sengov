During his time in public office, navigating the many strong opinions of others has been one of his strengths to build consensus, reach decisions and create progress.

Rep.Dell'Aquila has demonstrated the qualifications, experience and a collegial approach needed to advance the concerns of his constituents and help Ohio continue building a future of opportunity, prosperity, and safety.

Rep.

In addition, he will strive to protect our rights, especially those of our most vulnerable citizens, such as senior and disabled Ohioans, as well as promoting greater transparency and efficiency in government.

His father was an autoworker and very active in the United Auto Workers until his retirement. His mother set annual real estate sales records before forming her own successful brokerage firm. His sister is a medical geneticist.
