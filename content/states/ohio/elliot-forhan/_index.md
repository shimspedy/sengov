State Representative Elliot Forhan is serving his first term in the Ohio House of Representatives, representing House District 21. The district is on the East Side of Cuyahoga County and includes the cities of Euclid, South Euclid, Lyndhurst, Beachwood and Highland Heights and an eastern part of each of the Cleveland neighborhoods of North and South Collinwood and Euclid Park.

Rep. Forhan plans to work to obtain for his district concrete, tangible improvements and to enact the priorities that reflect his values. Those priorities include defending Roe and fighting for Ohio women, enacting common-sense gun safety and ending gerrymandering.

In his professional career, Rep. Forhan maintains a law office in South Euclid as a solo practitioner, representing companies in commercial transactions and tenants in disputes with their landlords. He does volunteer work for the Cleveland Housing Organizing Project and the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland. He is a co-founder and the general counsel of a nonprofit organization that focuses on patent law, and he advises the Ohio Public Banking Coalition.

Rep. Forhan obtained his law degree from Yale University and his college degree in mathematics and political science from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. He lives in South Euclid. He applied to join the Ohio Army National Guard and expects to enlist soon. His interests include deer-hunting, playing chess and following college football.
