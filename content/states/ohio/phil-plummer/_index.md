He joined the Montgomery County Sheriffâ€™s Office as a corrections officer in 1988, where he was responsible for the supervision, security and safety of the prisoners in his charge.

Just one short year later in March 2005, he was promoted to the high rank of Chief Deputy (Second in Command).  On July 7th, 2008 Phil Plummer was gratefully appointed as Sheriff of Montgomery County.
