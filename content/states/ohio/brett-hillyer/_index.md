A lifelong resident of Ohio, Hillyer earned a bachelor’s degree in accounting from the University of Akron and a Juris Doctor Degree from Ohio Northern University. He began private practice in 2011 at the Law Firm of Connolly, Hillyer & Ong and, in 2016, became an agent for Ohio Bar Title and Commonwealth Title.

In 2013, Hillyer was elected Uhrichsville City Law Director & Prosecutor. As Law Director, Hillyer managed Tuscarawas County’s only functioning land bank, which has successfully acquired and sold abandoned properties and salvaged blighted properties to raise property values and clean up neighborhoods with minimal costs to taxpayers.

In addition to his law practice, Hillyer advises the villages of West Lafayette, Freeport, and Roswell. Hillyer further lends his time to the Dennison Rotary, The Tuscarawas County Business Factory, and the Uhrichsville Clay Museum.
