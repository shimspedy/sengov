Meredith Craig is serving in her first term as State Representative for Ohio House District 77, representing all of Wayne County. Born and raised in Wayne County, Meredith is a proud Wayne Township resident. She graduated from Smithville High School and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Political Science from Malone University.

Meredith’s career in public service began after being accepted into the Legislative Service Commission fellowship, where she gained valuable experience working in the Ohio Senate. She later served as senior legislative aide to Representative Ron Amstutz, who previously represented the district she now serves, and held the role of Speaker Pro Tempore.

In 2015, Meredith graduated from the prestigious Jo Ann Davidson Leadership Institute, further enhancing her leadership skills and expanding her influence in the political sphere.

Her professional experience also spans across both the Kasich and DeWine administrations, where she worked in the Ohio Department of Insurance. Most recently, Meredith advocated for Ohio’s businesses as part of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.

A committed community leader, Meredith is a Wooster Rotarian and actively involved in her local church, Hillside Baptist Church in Rittman. She is married to Ricky Craig, a deputy sheriff for Wayne County, and together they continue to support their community.
