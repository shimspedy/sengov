Born and raised in the greater Collinwood and Glenville communities, Terrence is a proud graduate of St. Peter Chanel High School. He earned his bachelor's degree in Political Science from Cleveland State University and is currently enrolled at Cleveland State University's College of Law, seeking his Juris Doctorate degree.

Although busy juggling school and elected official business, he vows to be a true and trusted ally in the Statehouse for his community. From rebuilding crumbling infrastructure, to ensuring students receive a quality education, to increasing Ohio's local government fund, Terrence believes we can once again lead the nation in innovation and sustainability.

In District 20 and across Ohio, he wants to reverse the impact constituents have felt of a state legislature that continues to cut community resources. He has worked hard to pass legislation to help working class families and underrepresented groups. In topics ranging from maternal and infant health, common sense gun legislation, criminal justice reform and fair treatment for those with disabilities.
