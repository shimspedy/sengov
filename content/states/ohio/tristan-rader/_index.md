Tristan Rader serves as State Representative for Ohio’s 13th District, representing Cleveland’s West Side and Lakewood. A dedicated advocate for sustainability, economic justice, and social equity, Tristan’s journey into public service began with grassroots activism and a deep commitment to addressing systemic barriers faced by Ohioans. From his early work at the Greater Cleveland Food Bank, where he connected thousands to critical resources and successfully lobbied for increased state funding, to his tenure on Lakewood City Council, he has always focused on meeting community needs through bold, innovative solutions.

Elected to the Lakewood City Council in 2017, Tristan quickly established himself as a leader who delivers results. He spearheaded Lakewood’s 100% clean energy commitment, initiated the city’s first Climate Action Plan, and raised the minimum wage for city employees. Under his leadership, Lakewood became the first Ohio suburb to commit to renewable energy, demonstrating his ability to combine visionary policies with practical outcomes. He also championed transparency reforms, affordable housing initiatives, and the creation of new public parks, ensuring that government serves the needs of all residents.

Tristan’s passion for renewable energy extended statewide during his time as the Ohio Director for Solar United Neighbors. In this role, he empowered thousands of residents to adopt solar power, managed community solar programs, and worked to advance clean energy policies that benefit everyday Ohioans. His efforts have transformed the clean energy landscape across Ohio, providing a blueprint for sustainable growth.

Tristan holds a Bachelor of Business from Kent State University, a Master of Public Administration from Cleveland State University, and a Certificate in Renewable Energy Development from Yale University. His academic background, coupled with years of experience in social services, government, and renewable energy, equips him with the tools to craft thoughtful, evidence-based solutions to Ohio’s most pressing challenges.

With a commitment to building a just and sustainable future, Tristan Rader continues to work tirelessly to create a brighter, fairer Ohio for all.
