State Representative Darnell T. Brewer is currently serving his first term in the Ohio House of Representatives representing House District 18, which includes portions of Cleveland, including the communities of Garfield Heights and Maples Heights.

He has been serving as a Social Service Coordinator for over 15 years.  Throughout the years, he has held positions as an Assistant Administrator, parent liaison, WAVE Mediation training and providers, and truancy officer within the Cleveland Public Schools. He has also provided case management in community re-entry, through C.A.T.S. (Community Assessment and Treatment Services) for formerly incarcerated individuals. In addition, he has advocated and provided case management for single fathers, drawing on his own experience as a single father.

His educational background includes a BA, in Urban Studies, a Minor in Communications and a Certificate in Nonprofit Management from Cleveland State University. Furthermore, he received a Master of Legal Studies from Cleveland State University School of Law. To better serve his community, he received certification as a Community Health Worker, Ohio Certified Prevention Specialist II, and numerous other designations.

As an advocate, he has, and will continue, to fight tirelessly to ensure equitable treatment and opportunities relating to health and health equity, criminal and environmental justice, voting and educational rights, and economic empowerment. Darnell has served on the Executive Committee of several Civic and Community Organizations including the Cleveland Chapter of the NAACP, National Association of Community Health Workers, Carl Stokes Brigade, Southern Christian Leadership Council and National Action Network and several other prominent organizations.

Across Ohio, there is a shortage of available and affordable housing. Therefore, he pledges to fight for all families who sacrifice necessities like healthy food and healthcare to pay rent and experience residential insecurities such as evictions. As a Community Health Worker (CHW), he will advocate with and for CHWs to empower others directly through health initiatives and the promotion of individual health outcomes. As a business owner in District 18, he will work vigorously to help develop and grow Ohio's small, minority-owned, and socially economically disadvantaged businesses. In the years to come, he aims to prioritize combating poverty, increasing funding for public transportation, and continuing to shine a light on preventing maternal/infant mortality and morbidity.
