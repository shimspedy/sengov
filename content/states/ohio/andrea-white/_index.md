State Representative Andrea White is serving her second term in the Ohio House of Representatives. She represents the 36th House District, which includes Kettering, Moraine, Oakwood, Belmont and portions of Dayton in Montgomery County.

A long-time resident in the 36th District, White graduated from Centerville High School and received her bachelor’s degree from Wright State University. She served as the Clerk of Court for Kettering Municipal Court from 2004 until she was elected to the House. While Clerk of Court, Representative White focused on reinventing processes, leveraging technology and returning millions in revenues and cost savings to improve how government serves its citizens.   She also worked on criminal justice issues locally and statewide as legislative co-chair and president of the Ohio Association of Municipal/County Court Clerks.

Along with her public service, Representative White brings deep experience in the private sector where she owned a small business providing communications and process improvement consulting solutions for corporations, small businesses, arts, healthcare and other non-profit organizations for over 15 years. She also served as a project coordinator for a statewide organization to increase inclusion and eliminate barriers for Ohioans with developmental disabilities, worked in early intervention and worked as a hospital communications professional.  

Representative White’s desire to serve and bring change for the good extends to her leadership in the community.  White has been a leader in helping to launch initiatives to address teen alcohol and drug prevention, addiction, hunger and criminal justice issues.  She helped found the South Suburban Coalition and served as long-time chair and board member for Kettering’s Partners for Healthy Youth. She has also been active in the region’s effort to combat the opioid epidemic and substance use, serving on the Montgomery County Community Overdose Action Team, the Montgomery County Drug-Free Coalition and the Montgomery County Prevention Coalition.

Representative White and her husband John reside in Kettering, where they raised their family and attend a local church. They have three daughters, two sons-in-law, and four grandchildren.
