State Representative Jon Cross is currently serving his third and final term representing Ohio's 83rd District, encompassing Hancock, Hardin, and parts of Logan counties in Northwest Ohio. Elected by his peers at the onset of the 135th General Assembly, Cross assumed the role of Assistant Majority Floor Leader within House Leadership. Additionally, he has been appointed to serve on the Ohio House Energy and Natural Resources, Finance, and Government Oversight Committees.

Cross is deeply dedicated to fostering a safer, more robust, and business-friendly environment in Ohio. Throughout his tenure, he has emerged as a leading advocate for economic growth, workforce development, and educational initiatives geared toward ensuring Ohio's competitiveness on the national stage.

His legislative record reflects a commitment to action. Over the past six years, Cross has authored thirteen bills that have been enacted into law. He has achieved acquiring a record level of state funding for his district, totaling over $123 million to-date, and allocated towards crucial areas such as local school funding, safety grants, community projects, transportation enhancements, and infrastructure initiatives. Notably, he played a pivotal role in past operating budget, securing historic income tax cuts for all Ohioans and spearheaded initiatives like the $50 million pole replacement program to improve Ohio’s rural broadband expansion and the $750 million “All Ohio Future Fund” aimed at fortifying the state's economic landscape and site readiness for future economic projects.

Cross's influence extends to the realm of higher education, where he has chaired the Ohio House Finance Subcommittee on Higher Education during the 134th General Assembly and served as a Commissioner to the Midwestern Higher Education Compact. Recognizing the pivotal role of education in driving economic progress, he has championed collaborative efforts between educational institutions and the business community. His advocacy has led to increased funding for programs like Ohio's TechCred initiative, designed to equip students with skills for in-demand careers, and bolstered STEM scholarships to nurture innovation and research.

Building upon his legislative successes for higher education and the recruitment and retention of college graduates to remain in Ohio, Cross introduced the GROW (Graduating and Retaining Ohio’s Workforce) Ohio Act, a visionary piece of legislation aimed at revitalizing Ohio's population and future workforce through strategic incentives in collaboration with higher education and business entities. Portions of this bill were integrated into the following operating budget, reflecting Cross's pragmatic approach to policymaking.

In the arena of economic development, Cross has been a leading voice for enhancing Ohio's business climate. He has championed tax reforms to support small businesses and attracted major investments, collaborating with entities like JobsOhio to secure game-changing projects such as Intel, Honda, and Ford's manufacturing facilities.

Beyond his legislative endeavors, Cross remains deeply invested in enhancing the quality of life in Northwest Ohio. He has secured substantial funding for rural broadband expansion, infrastructure improvements, and flood mitigation projects, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to his constituents' well-being.

Prior to his tenure in the Ohio House of Representatives, Cross served as the chief executive officer and economic development director for the Hardin County Chamber & Business Alliance. His diverse professional background spans the public and private sectors, encompassing experiences in business, economic and workforce development, government, higher education, and real estate development.

A proud graduate of Kenton High School and The Ohio State University, Cross resides with his wife, Christina, a practicing attorney, and their two sons, Carson and Connor in Findlay, Ohio.
