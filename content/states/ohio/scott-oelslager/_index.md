State Representative Scott Oelslager is serving his third term in the Ohio House of Representatives, after serving multiple terms in both the Senate and House previously. He represents the 48th House District, which includes portions of Stark County.

Prior to embarking on his legislative career, Oelslager worked as an aide to former Ohio Congressman Ralph Regula, and later served as director of public relations for Malone College. He was appointed to the Ohio Senate in 1985, where the people of Stark County subsequently returned him for four additional terms. In 2002, Oelslager was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Civil and Commercial Law Committee. Because of his strong leadership and experience, Stark County voters once again elected him to represent them in the Ohio Senate in 2010. Following the redistricting of the state in 2010, Oelslager was elected in 2014 by the newly formed 29th Senate District.
