State Representative Jamie Callender is currently serving his third term in the Ohio House of Representatives. He represents the 57th House District, which includes the majority of Lake County.

Representative Callender has an extensive record of service to Lake County, volunteering with a variety of organizations and serving on several boards, including the Lake County Historical Society. He served as a trustee on the Mentor Public Library Board, where he worked to improve the library, making it more efficient and increasing circulation.

Callender previously served four two-year terms in the Ohio House of Representatives, earning accolades for his work ethic, his Republican leadership and his advocacy for Lake County. He received the NRA’s Defender of the 2nd Amendment Award for his efforts to protect our constitutional rights and was a two-time winner of the Watchdog of the Treasury Award.

He was also widely regarded for his leadership for Ohio’s schools. His efforts included work to improve academic achievement and improve school accountability while lessoning the reliance on property taxes. He worked to increase parental involvement in the education of their children and worked to give low income families more options in the education of their children.

After growing up in Concord Township and graduating from Mentor High School, Rep. Callender received his undergraduate degree from Cleveland State University and earned his law degree from Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. Callender continues to practice law at a small law office in Lake County and has taught at Kent State University for more than 12 years.
