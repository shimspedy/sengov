State Representative Justin Pizzulli was recently appointed State Representative for the 90th Ohio House District, which encompasses all of Scioto and Adams Counties, as well as parts of Brown County.  His priorities are protecting the sanctity of life, protecting Ohioansâ€™ second amendment rights, and promoting economic growth and prosperity.

Outside of his role as State Representative, Rep. Pizzulli works as a realtor in Wheelersburg and as a Class 1 Commercial Freight Conductor in Portsmouth. He also has a packed resume of campaign and management experience. His previous experience and current careers allow him to bring a unique perspective to the table as an elected official and better represent the people of the 90th House District.

Rep. Pizzulli lives in Franklin Furnace and in his free time, he is probably enjoying a movie.
