Senator George Lang is currently serving his first term in the Ohio Senate representing the people of the 4th Senate District, which covers the majority of Butler County. He previously served two terms in the Ohio House of Representatives.

Senator Lang graduated from Southeast Missouri State University in 1985 with a major in Communications and a double minor in Marketing and Speech. Since moving to West Chester in 1990, he has been an active member of the community, including more than two decades in public service. After serving seven years on the West Chester Board of Zoning Appeals, he ran for and won the election for township trustee in 2003, where he served until being appointed to the House.

Following eight years spent in various sales and managerial positions at Procter & Gamble, Senator Lang left to start his own business in the financial services industry and has started numerous businesses since. Today, more than 100 people are employed by businesses he helped to create.

In 2018, Senator Lang and several of his Senate and House colleagues created the Business First Caucus to help small businesses in Ohio thrive and become more successful. Since then, the Business First Caucus has  grown to be the largest bi-partisan, bicameral legislative Caucus with a vast network of supporters including entrepreneurs and public and private organizations throughout the state.

Lang and his high school sweetheart, Debbie, have been married for 36 years. They have two daughters, Amy and Alicia, and live in West Chester.
