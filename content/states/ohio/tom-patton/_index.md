A lifelong resident of Cuyahoga County, Senator Tom Patton grew up as one of nine kids on the near west side of Cleveland. The son of a Cleveland police officer and the father of a Cleveland Heights police officer who tragically died in the line of duty, Patton has taken up many legislative initiatives pertaining to police, firefighters, and first responders. Senator Patton has nearly two decades of experience in the Ohio General Assembly. Though his legislative responsibilities in Columbus have grown over the years, community and family come first for Patton.

Patton first served in the Ohio Senate in 2008. During his time in the Senate, he served as Majority Floor Leader, Vice Chairman of the Senate Transportation and Commerce and Labor Committee and was a member of multiple other committees including Finance. In addition to his standing committees, he served as co-chair of the Ohio Senate Autism Caucus, and as a member of the Ohio Athletic Commission, the ODOT Transportation Futures Steering Committee, the Ohio Turnpike Commission, and the Legislative Service Commission.

During the 131st General Assembly, Patton sponsored Senate Bill 27 which ensures that a firefighter who is disabled as a result of cancer under certain circumstances is presumed for purposes of the laws governing workers' compensation and the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund to have incurred the cancer while performing official duties as a firefighter.

In his effort to attract and retain good jobs in the Cleveland area, Senator Patton has worked to expand access to higher education, invest in high-tech research and development, and lower taxes. He has supported income tax cuts for Ohioans and small business tax cuts, measures that have been included in the state's biennial budget.

With Cleveland’s economy in mind, Senator Patton was a champion for enacting a film tax credit to ensure Northeast Ohio can be competitive with other states in attracting the $60 billion film industry and the jobs that come with it. Working with local officials, Patton was also the primary sponsor of the bill that authorized use of a “land bank” as a new tool to help counties contend with the foreclosure crisis and curb urban blight.

Over the years, Senator Patton has been recognized and honored by a diverse group of organizations and advocates. He was named an Honorary D.A.R.E. Officer by the D.A.R.E. Association of Ohio and has been recognized by the Autism Society of Ohio for his work to increase awareness of autism. He has also been named a ‘Watchdog of the Treasury’ multiple times for his commitment to fiscal responsibility. In addition, he has earned the Ohio Land Bank Association Lifetime Achievement Award, Moms for Ohio Public Service Award, the FOP Distinguished Public Servant Award, as well as twice the FOP Legislator of the Year Award, the Ohio Public Images Award, the Ohio Alpaca Breeders Association Legislator Award, the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council Legislator of the Year for Protecting Consumer Choice Award, Legislator of the Year by the Ohio Professional Society of Engineers, ADAMHS Board of Cuyahoga County Legislator of the Year Award, National Security Leadership Award, and the Irish Good Fellow of the Year Award.

Patton is an active member of St. Colman’s parish and serves as chair of the church’s finance committee.  He serves on the Incarnate Word Academy and Holy Name High School endowment boards, is a Cleveland Police Historical Society trustee, and has been a longstanding member of the Strongsville Chamber of Commerce, Bluecoats, Knights of Columbus, and VFW Post 3345.

A widower, he raised his family of five daughters and one son in Strongsville and has been blessed with ten grandchildren. The 24th Senate District encompasses portions of western Cuyahoga County, including Patton's hometown of Strongsville.
