State Representative Rachel Baker is currently serving her first term in the Ohio House of Representatives representing House District 27, which includes the eastern side of Hamilton County and portions of Cincinnati.

Rep. Baker ran for office to use her problem-solving skills to make decisions that are backed by evidence when addressing the issues facing Ohioans. She is particularly interested in improving access to quality healthcare, increasing support for mental health care, promoting preventive care and population health, advocating for adequate funding of Ohio’s public schools, and increasing good-paying jobs for working families to promote Ohioans’ ability to live happy and healthy lives.  

Rep. Baker holds a bachelor’s in nursing from the University of Cincinnati, a master’s in social work from the University of Michigan, and a Ph.D. in nursing from the University of Cincinnati. In her professional career, she is a nurse researcher providing leadership and strategic planning related to a healthcare system’s nursing evidence-based practice and research activities. She provides mentorship to direct care nurses in translating evidence to practice, in designing and conducting nursing research, and in disseminating inquiry work through national presentations and publications. Additionally, she serves as an adjunct instructor for graduate nursing students at several universities. She has authored 25 peer-reviewed journal articles and has presented locally, nationally, and internationally. She volunteers as a court-appointed special advocate providing support for children experiencing abuse and neglect.

Rep. Baker lives in Anderson Township with her three children. Her family is active in their community by volunteering, playing in school orchestras, soccer teams, cross-country teams, track teams, and swim teams.
