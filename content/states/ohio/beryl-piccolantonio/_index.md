Her passion for ensuring that every student in Ohio has the ability to pursue their dreams by receiving a high-quality education and her love for the Gahanna community motivated her to run for this position. As a dedicated public servant, parent, and a longtime resident of Gahanna, Rep. Brown Piccolantonio felt that joining the school board was a way to give back to her beloved community. In her first meeting as an active school board member, she was asked to lead the Board as president and held that role through the entirety of her tenure on the board.  Rep.
