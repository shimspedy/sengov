State Representative Dani Isaacsohn is currently serving his first term representing Ohio’s 24th House District. The district includes much of the City of Cincinnati: Westwood, Price Hill, Fairmount, the West End, Over-the-Rhine, Mt. Auburn, CUF, Walnut Hills, Downtown, Mt. Adams, the East End, Columbia-Tusculum, and Mt. Washington.

The son of immigrants, Rep. Isaacsohn was raised to believe that the unique privilege of growing up in the United States comes with a responsibility to try and be of service to others.

In the Statehouse, Rep. Isaacsohn is committed to fighting for better childcare for parents, more investments in both mental health services and extracurricular activities for young people, and making sure that seniors have what they need to age with dignity. He also knows that we have to tackle racial and income inequality head-on in order to make lasting progress.

Rep. Isaacsohn believes that we have to change the culture of our politics if we want to build a better future. This process starts by empowering the voices of people in the communities he serves and creating real partnerships between constituents and elected representatives.

That same passion is what drove him to start a successful small business, Cohear, which brings community members and decision makers together to solve problems and improve local policy. Through his work at Cohear, he has spent countless evenings organizing, listening to, and learning from the ideas of thousands of people about what would make their lives better. In addition, he has worked with dozens of government agencies and major institutions.

Rep. Isaacsohn is a former community and political organizer for multiple campaigns across the country, including the Obama and Clinton campaigns. He is also a longtime mentor and “Big Brother” through the Cincinnati Youth Collaborative, and has served on a number of local and national non-profit boards. Rep. Isaacsohn graduated from Walnut Hills High School, received a Bachelor’s Degree from Georgetown University, a Master’s from Cambridge University, and a J.D. from Yale Law School.
