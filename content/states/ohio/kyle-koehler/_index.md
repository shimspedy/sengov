Senator Kyle Koehler Is serving his first term in the Ohio Senate. He serves the people of the 10th Senate District which encompasses Clark, Greene, and Clinton Counties. 

A life-long resident of Clark County, State Senator Kyle Koehler graduated from Springfield Catholic Central in 1980 and Wright State University in 1984 with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science degree in Computer Science. 

Senator Koehler spent seven years working for government contractors at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and for the Navy as a Senior Software Engineer. During that time, he worked on everything from applying artificial intelligence to signal analysis for the Foreign Technology Division to developing human interface system for the Navy's ES-3A program. While in those positions, Koehler held a Top-Secret SCI clearance with the NSA.

Koehler returned to his family business as a Vice President in charge of Design and Development in 1990. K.K. Tool is the quintessential family business where six brothers and sisters all work together (with the rest of their employees) to make K.K. Tool Company a growing success.

Kyle and his wife, Kathrin, have been married for 36 years. They have raised and home educated their five adult children and have celebrated the marriages of four of their children (Jessica, Julia, Jordan and Joel). Their 25 year old son, Jacob, is currently in seminary. The Koehler's have been blessed with seven grandchildren.

He is actively involved with his church, Heritage Fellowship Church in Springfield and a lifelong supporter of Young Life Christian ministries. Besides supporting numerous non-profits in his district, Kyle and his wife have been financially active in the adoption of over 20 children in their church community.

Senator Koehler served eight years in the Ohio House of Representatives from 2015 to 2022.  During that time, Representative Koehler worked on and passed numerous laws including the reform of Payday Lending (HB123 of the 132nd GA) and the reform of Occupational Licensing (HB263 of the 133rd GA). In 2020, he was successful in repealing Duty To Retreat from state law by amending his bill, HB796, into a Senate bill before it was signed into law by the Governor.  During his time in the Ohio House, Koehler served as Chair of the House Agriculture and Rural Development Committee and was a member of several other committees including, Education, Workforce Development, Federalism, Labor and Commerce and Technology and Innovation. 

During the 136th General Assembly, Senator Koehler is serving as Chair of the Senate Workforce Development Committee, Vice Chair of both the Agriculture & Natural Resources Committee and Sunset Review Committee, as well as a member of the Education, Higher Education, and Local Government committees.  

At the age of 63, Kyle still raises, trains, and competes in speed competitions on the horses he raises on their farm in Northwest Clark County.  His family continues to use their hobby farm to collect, produce and bottle maple syrup during the months of February and March each year.
