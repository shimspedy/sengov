State Senator Susan Manchester is serving her first term in the Ohio Senate representing the 12th Senate District, which includes all of Allen, Auglaize, Champaign, Mercer, and Shelby counties, as well as portions of Darke and Logan counties.

Growing up on the family farm in Waynesfield, Ohio, Manchester graduated from The Ohio State University in 2010 with degrees in Psychology and Political Science. She worked in Washington, D.C. for Congressman Jim Jordan, where she focused on policies such as agriculture, health care, business and education. Upon returning to Ohio in 2016, Manchester took a position with a non-profit organization focused on mentoring kids.

Senator Manchester was first elected to the General Assembly in 2018 and served three terms in the Ohio House of Representatives. During her time in the Ohio House, she chaired the House Families, Aging, and Human Services Committee. Manchester also served as the Co-Vice Chair of the Ohio Legislative Children Caucus, where she fought for the protection of Ohio’s children. 

Manchester has championed legislation that became law to address several needs in her community. The senator established the Ohio Youth and Family Ombudsman Office through the Department of Jobs and Family Services to provide a layer of security and accountability for Ohio’s children. She created the Beginning Farmer Tax Credit Program, which helps assist one generation of farmers to the next. Manchester also worked to criminalize the use or manipulation of a controlled substance addiction as a method of human trafficking.

Senator Manchester resides in her hometown with her husband Isaac.
