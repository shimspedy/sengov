Raymond A. Hull (D) has served the residents of District 6 in Providence and North Providence since first being elected in November 2010. Representative Hull was appointed Deputy Speaker in January 2023. He is a member of the House Finance Committee, the House State Government and Elections Committee, and the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. He is the chairman of the Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Commission.

During the 2023 legislative session, Deputy Speaker Hull introduced a new law which requires motorists to slow down or leave a buffer lane when nonemergency vehicles are parked on the shoulder of highways. He was the primary sponsor on another new law which requires default notices to lessees of self-service storage facilities to be sent to the lessee’s last known address, and would require an advertisement of the sale of personal property to be published once on a publicly accessible website.

He also sponsored a bill which provides that adjunct faculty members at any state college or university who teach at least 50% of the hours regularly worked by full-time faculty in a semester would be eligible for the same medical benefits as other state employees.

In 2022, Deputy Speaker Hull was the main sponsor of a new law which develops dual language immersion programs in public schools. He was the sponsor of legislation which would require all public utilities to maintain a customer service facility within the state to perform services such as addressing customer inquiries and accepting bill payments, and he also introduced legislation requiring professionals authorized to prescribe opioid drugs discuss addiction risks with the patient or the patient’s parent or guardian if the patient is under 18 years of age.

In 2021, he chaired the House COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force.

Deputy Speaker Hull graduated from La Salle Academy in 1981. He attended the University of Rhode Island and Roger Williams University, where he obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice in 1992. He received his Master’s degree in the Administration of Justice from Anna Maria College in 1999.

Deputy Speaker Hull is currently the commanding officer of the Housing Unit in the Providence Police Department, where he has served for 28 years. He is the father of Andres and Karina, and resides in Providence.
