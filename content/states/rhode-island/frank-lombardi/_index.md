Frank S. Lombardi is a Democrat representing District 26 (Cranston) in the Rhode Island Senate.

First elected to the Senate in 2012, he has advanced legislation to protect children and workers, support families and small businesses, and promote government reform and transparency.

He has sponsored legislation, since signed into law, barring third-party delivery services from listing a business without that business's consent; prohibiting employers from making deductions from an employee's wages without written authorization from the worker; requiring court-appointed special advocate volunteers for abused children pass background checks; ensuring an adult trained in recognizing concussion symptoms is present during all youth sports events; adding dyslexia screening as a required portion of elementary literacy programs; and barring the sale of puppies that are not fully weaned.

He has introduced legislation to allow families to visit relatives in nursing homes during emergencies and permit homeowners to build accessory dwellings for family members. He has also sponsored 38 Studios transparency legislation and called for a joint legislative commission to study line-item veto authority and runoff elections for governor when no candidate receives a majority vote.

A longtime youth soccer official, Sen. Lombardi has been inducted into the Rhode Island Soccer Coaches Association Hall of Fame. The organization also named its Referee of the Year award – which he had won eight times – in his honor.

Sen. Lombardi was born on July 11, 1962. He and his wife, Antonelia, have twin daughters, Cassandra and Christina.

He earned his B.A. in business from Providence College and a J.D. from the Northeastern University School of Law. He is also a graduate of Classical High School in Providence.

An attorney and owner of Frank S. Lombardi Law Associates at 370 Atwood Ave. in Cranston, he has practiced law for nearly three decades. He also served as a Probate Clerk/Judge for the City of Providence from 1994-2004.

Sen. Lombardi is a parishioner of the Holy Apostles Church; a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association and the Rhode Island Association for Justice; President of the Rhode Island Soccer Officials Association; a former member of the Board of Directors for the Justinian Law Society; former Vice President of the Probate Judges Association; a former member of the Board of Trustees for Saint Mary's Academy Bay View; and a former Board Member for Saint Rocco's School.​
