Walter S. Felag, Jr. is a Democrat representing District 10 (Bristol, Tiverton, Warren) in the Rhode Island Senate.

Prior to being elected to the General Assembly, Sen. Felag served on the Warren Town Council for two decades, from 1978 to 1998. He was the council's president from 1986 to 1998. He first won election to the Senate in 1998.

Sen. Felag has been active in veterans' issues, sponsoring bills focused on employment rights and housing discrimination protections for those who have served. He also supported legislation to exempt military pensions from income tax and sponsored a proposal to create a “U.S. Bronze Star Medal" specialty license plate.

He has sponsored legislation to close a loophole in the state's sexual assault statute; require that litter prevention and recycling awareness be taught in Rhode Island's schools; expand Home Community Care Services Program eligibility to people with Alzheimer's or dementia; ensure customers have access to affordable prescription options; create new rules for PFAS in drinking water; exempt reusable bags from the state's sales tax; increase the amount of beer breweries can sell directly to customers; and end the practice of budget “scoops" from quasi-public agencies.

Sen. Felag has been honored with an AARP Capitol Caregiver Award and with the Rhode Island Farm Bureau's “Navigator" award. He has also been recognized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

Sen. Felag was born on Feb. 15, 1954. He and his wife, Elaine, have two children, Jake and Zeke.

A 1972 graduate of Warren High School, he earned his B.A. in math from Providence College in 1976. He is a senior computer software engineer for SEACORP.
