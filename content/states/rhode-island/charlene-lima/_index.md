Charlene M. Lima (D) represents District 14 in Cranston and Providence. First elected in November 1992, Representative Lima is a member of the House Small Business Committee.

During the 2023 legislative session, Representative Lima introduced legislation which requires persons or entities receiving government funds to disclose the names of their contractors and subcontractors. She also introduced bills that ban the sale of cosmetics developed and manufactured using animal testing and a bill which creates a mandatory jail sentence of ten years for two or more people who break into a business with the intent to steal.

In 2022, Representative Lima introduced a bill that creates custody procedures for pets in divorce cases, citing that that in a divorce proceeding, pets were often viewed as property and used as leverage over the other party without regard to the pet’s well-being. She also introduced legislation which would provide that any person 18 years of age or older may possess a stun gun and provide that those persons who are issued a license to carry a firearm may also carry a stun gun.


She has also been recognized with the Fogarty Award for supporting programs to help disabled Rhode Islanders, the ATAP Legislative Award for her law to improve phone services for disabled Rhode Islanders, the ​​National Federation of the Blind Distinguished Service Award for her law helping disabled citizens, a Defenders of Animal Award, a National Humane Society of the United States award for Legislator of the Year, the Attorney General’s Justice Award for Consumer Protection, and the Public Service Award from the RI Health Care Association.

Representative Lima has a long history of public service. In the past, she has served on the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Juvenile Justice Task Force, the Secretary of the State's Panel for Election Law Reform, and the District Representative Committee.  

A retired educator, she taught for the Providence School Department and was a member of the American Federation of Teachers and the Providence Teacher’s Union. She has also been involved with the Rhode Island Society to Prevent Blindness and the Women’s Auxiliary of the St. Mary’s Feast Society.

Representative Lima was born on August 18, 1953, and is married to Frank Fiorenzano. She earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Rhode Island in 1975, following her graduation from Classical High School in Providence in 1971.
