Bridget G. Valverde has been a Democratic Senator for Rhode Island's 35th District since January 1, 2019. Her election marked a significant shift in the district, historically held by Republicans, when she secured the seat on November 6, 2018. This victory coincided with a nationwide surge of American women gaining seats in Congress and state legislatures.

Born on October 23, 1982, Valverde is an alumna of George Washington University and has been an active participant in Democratic causes, from local campaigns in Connecticut to advocacy in Rhode Island. Before her Senate career, she was notably involved with the Rhode Island Democratic Party Women's Caucus and championed various causes, including reproductive rights.

Representing North Kingstown, South Kingstown, Narragansett, and East Greenwich, Senator Valverde has taken roles on key Senate Committees focusing on Environment, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services. Her election to the previously Republican-dominated 35th District was a notable part of the 2018 midterms, where she won against the Republican candidate by a significant margin, marking a notable shift in local politics. Her victory, seen as part of a broader trend of increasing female political representation, was fueled by a surge in women's activism and political engagement following the 2016 presidential election.
