Dawn Euer is a Democrat representing District 13 (Newport, Jamestown) in the Rhode Island Senate.

As an activist and organizer, Euer helped lead the fight for marriage equality in Rhode Island before winning election to the Senate in a 2017 special election.

During her time in the legislature, she has advocated on issues related to the environment, economic justice, women's rights and more.

She was the lead sponsor of 2021's historic Act on Climate, which is the most comprehensive climate legislation in Rhode Island history. As the representative of a district on the front lines of climate change, she continues to advocate for substantial investments in renewable energy and resiliency.

She was part of the effort to codify safe and legal abortion access into state law through the Reproductive Privacy Act. She was also the Senate sponsor of the Student Loan Bill of Rights in 2019 and of a measure safeguarding women's access to contraception through insurance.

Sen. Euer has additionally introduced legislation barring high-capacity magazines for firearms; removing the spousal exemption from the state's rape law; requiring registration of short-term rentals listed on third-party platforms; seeking the creation of an independent redistricting commission; and prohibiting evictions during a state of emergency.

In 2022, Sen. Euer was named USA TODAY's Women of the Year honoree for Rhode Island. The awards recognize women across the country who have made a significant impact.

In 2021, in recognition of her work on the Act on Climate, Sen. Euer was honored as an Environmental Champion by Clean Water Action. She recently attended COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, taking part in numerous panels about state leadership on climate action.

Also in 2021, Sen. Euer was honored with a Humane State Legislator Award from the Humane Society of the United States. The award recognized her work on Rhode Island's 2019 puppy mill law and her support of legislation seeking to phase-out fur sales.

Additionally, Sen. Euer was named Rhode Island Lawyers Weekly Attorney of the Year in 2021, the Audubon Society of Rhode Island's Legislator of the Year in 2019, and the 2021 recipient of U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's Service Recognition Award, which included a congressional statement for the record.

Born on June 14, 1979, Sen. Euer is a 2007 graduate of the University of Minnesota. She went on to earn a J.D. from Roger Williams University of Law in 2010. She is currently a candidate for a master's degree in marine affairs at the University of Rhode Island. She works as an attorney in private practice at the Law Office of Dawn Euer.

She is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association Board of Delegates and a Board Member of Higher Ground International. She was previously a Supervising Attorney of the Roger William's University School of Law Pro Bono Collaborative. She currently serves as General Counsel for the Capital Good Fund.

She has also previously served on the boards of the Environmental Justice League of RI and Bike Newport and on Newport's Energy & Environment Commission, advising the City Council on renewables, sustainable planning and other environmental matters.
