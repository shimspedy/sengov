Joseph J. Solomon Jr. (D) was first elected in November 2014 as the State Representative from District 22, Warwick. Representative Solomon is the chair of the House Corporations Committee and is a member of the House Oversight Committee and the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee.

During the 2023 session, he sponsored legislation that allows nursing home residents more money to pay for their monthly personal needs. That bill became part of the adopted state budget. He also sponsored a law that increased the amount of costs for repairs that a tenant may deduct from their rent.

Rerpresentative Solomon sponsored legislation that created a special commission to study the reasons for the state’s diminishing quahog catch. He currently serves as co-chairman of that commission.

In 2022, he introduced a law designed to help curb the theft of catalytic converters. He also introduced legislation to construct safety barriers on Rhode Island bay bridges to deter suicide attempts. That proposal made its way into the 2022-23 state budget, which includes funding to study the feasibility of the project.

A strong advocate for the elderly, Representative Solomon sponsored a new law in 2021 that requires financial institutions to report suspected financial exploitation of seniors to the Office of Healthy Aging.

In 2019, he sponsored a law to create the Rhode Island Small Business Development Fund, which is designed to encourage the formation of private capital investment in small business by federally licensed investment companies.

During the 2018 session, he sponsored a law to allow existing sexual education curriculum to incorporate age-appropriate elements of effective and evidence-based programs on the law and meaning of consent in the context of existing family life courses.

In 2017, Representative Solomon introduced an animal-protection law which requires that the sheltering and nourishment of dogs conform to the industry standards established by the Tufts Animal Care and Conditions Scale. He also successfully introduced a Justice Reinvestment reform bill that allows those individuals with prior convictions for possession with intent to deliver or crimes of violence to be eligible for the drug court program in Superior Court.

Representative Solomon has received the Golden Paw Award from Animal Rescue Rhode Island for his advocacy for animals. He was also presented with the Humane Heroes Award by Defenders of Animals. Additionally, he was recognized by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine for his efforts in sponsoring legislation to ban the ongoing, lethal use of animals​​​ in medical training.

An attorney and business owner, he is licensed to practice law in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, as well as the U.S. District Courts in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. He is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association.

Born September 4, 1983, Representative Solomon graduated in 2001 from Bishop Hendricken High School, received his Bachelor’s degree in accounting from Providence College in 2005, and obtained his Juris Doctorate degree from New England Law Boston in 2008.
