Representative Edward T. Cardillo Jr. (D) was first elected in November 2020 to the seat in House District 42 in Johnston and Cranston. He serves as a member of the House Labor Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the House Small Business Committee.

During the 2023 legislative session, he sponsored a new law that requires officials to disclose default judgments of credit card debt — part of ongoing efforts of the General Assembly to increase transparency in the legislative process.

In 2022, a bill he introduced legislation to remove the $8 fee for vehicle owners who acquire a newly redesigned license plate effectively became law when the proposal was included in the state budget. He also cosponsored a new law that requires annual weapons qualifications for correctional officers and a law designed to help curb the theft of catalytic converters.

An employee of J. DeMarco Landscape Inc. and a former mechanic, Representative Cardillo formerly served on the Johnston Housing Authority. He is also a member of the House District 42 Democratic Committee​ and previously served on the Johnston Democratic Town Committee.

He graduated from Cranston High School West in 1973.

Born December 11, 1954, he and his wife Patricia live in Johnston and have two daughters, Brianna and Lauren​.​
