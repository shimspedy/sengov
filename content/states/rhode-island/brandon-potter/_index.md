Brandon Potter was first elected in 2020 to represent the peop​le of District 16, which encomapasses the Garden City, Eden Park, and Stadium neighborhoods in Cranston. Representative Potter currently serves on the House Corporations Committee, the House Committee on Labor, the House Committee on Special Legislation, and as Second Vice Chair of the House Committee on Health and Human Services.

Representative Potter sponsored legislation enacted in 2022 requiring construction projects worth more than $10 million that receive state tax credits through the Rebuild RI or historic preservation programs to pay their construction workers the prevailing wage. He was the sponsor of legislation, later included in the state budget bill, seeking an investment of $250 million in school construction, which voters approved in 2022. He sponsored legislation passed in 2022 to increase transparency around affordable housing development, sponsored a law that permanently requires the state to analyze overdose deaths to help identify ways to reduce their prevalence, and sponsored a low to reduce the time health insurance companies are allowed to ​clawback payments to behavioral and mental health care providers.​

Representative Potter also cosponsored laws to authorize a pilot program to prevent drug overdoses through the establishment of harm reduction centers, prohibit housing discrimination based on source of income, and raise the minimum wage to $15/hour. Another bill he sponsored would add a new tax bracket for the richest 1 percent of Rhode Islanders as an equitable means to generate much-needed state revenue.​

Born August 6, 1984, he grew up in Cranston and went to Cranston West High School. He attended Community College of Rhode Island and graduated magna cum laude from Rhode Island College. He has nearly a decade of experience in the automobile industry, and is currently studying at Roger Williams University School of Law.
