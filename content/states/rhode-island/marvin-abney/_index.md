He also introduced a new law​​​ which would increase the percentage set aside for affordable units in qualifying projects, and, in turn, increase the number of allowable units per acre for all housing projects subject to inclusionary zoning.

Born on November ​​​10, 1949, he attended Dunbar High School in Texarkana, Texas, and in 2018 was honored by the Texarkana Independent School District as a Distinguished Alumnus.

He earned his bachelor’s degree in public administration at Stephen F. Austin State University in 1975, a master’s of management degree from Webster University in 1982, a master’s of business administration from the University of Rhode Island in 2000, and a certificate of advanced graduate study in educational leadership from Johnson & Wales University in 2005.
