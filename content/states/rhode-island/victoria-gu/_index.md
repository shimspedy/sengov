Victoria Gu is a Democrat representing District 38 (Westerly, Charlestown, South Kingstown) in the Rhode Island Senate.

Sen. Gu was elected to the Senate in November 2022. She has a lengthy history of community service and advocacy and previously served as chair of Charlestown's Climate Resiliency Commission.

In her first year in the Senate, she advocated for housing affordability, protecting the environment, improving public education and supporting small businesses.

Sen. Gu sponsored a law that puts Rhode Island on track to become the first state to adopt the 2024 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for new and renovated buildings. The codes will include, for the first time, electric readiness and will promote energy efficiency. She also sponsored a law to protect seniors from gift card fraud and helped secure more funding for emergency rescue services.

She cosponsored many other laws, including ones that will help replace lead water lines, ban single-use Styrofoam takeout containers at restaurants, reform the Coastal Resources Management Council, combat childhood lead poisoning, increase funding for mental health services in schools and promote electric charging stations.

She also advocated for laws to tackle the cost of housing throughout the state and sponsored a bill to promote Accessory Dwelling Units.

The daughter of immigrants from China, Sen. Gu grew up in South Kingstown. She is a graduate of South Kingstown High School and Harvard University. She works as a software engineer and data analyst, and now resides in Charlestown.
