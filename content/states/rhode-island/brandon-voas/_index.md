Rep. Brandon Voas (D-Dist. 57, Cumberland, Central Falls) was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives in November 2022. He is a member of the House Corporations Committee and the House Education Committee.

During his first legislative session in 2023, Representative Voas saw two pieces of legislation he sponsored become law. The first bill provides significant relief for Rhode Island’s small businesses by creating a $50,000 exemption for all businesses subject to the tangible tax. The exemption completely wipes out the tangible tax — viewed as an administrative burden for small businesses and for the municipalities that collect it — for 75 percent of Rhode Island businesses.

The second piece of legislation would require lead hazard mitigation for pre-1978 rental dwelling units by removing the exemption from owner occupied two- or three-unit homes, allowing the state to enforce the Lead Hazard Mitigation Act.

A lifelong resident of Cumberland, he is a graduate of Cumberland High School. He also attended the Community College of Rhode Island where he graduated with a degree in Liberal Arts.

He currently works as the Parts Director for Nucar Volkswagen. He was born on October 4, 1993.​
