Evan P. Shanley (D) was first elected in November 2016 to the seat in House District 24, Warwick. He is the chairman of the House State Government and Elections Committee and is a member of the House Innovation, Internet and Technology Committee; the House Municipal Government and Housing Committee; and the House Rules Committee.

A strong advocate for fair, secure and transparent elections, he introduced new laws during the 2023 session that change certain deadlines for declarations of candidacy and party disaffiliation, as well as changing the date of special primary elections to streamline the electoral process.

In 2022, Representative Shanley introduced a new law that allows for the early certification of mail ballots as well as establishing a new and more comprehensive mail ballot voter signature verification process. He also championed the “Let RI Vote Act,” which expands voter access while ensuring the integrity of Rhode Island elections.

In 2021, he sponsored a law to ensure that all students who wish to pursue a career and technical education have access to high quality programs both within and outside of their community of residence.

In 2020, Representative Shanley introduced a law that amends the state’s emergency mail ballot procedures in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislation adds an additional option for securing a mail ballot by permitting emergency mail ballot applications to be processed at local boards of canvassers in person on electronic poll pads, which allows voters to cast their ballot and place the ballot themselves into a state-approved voting machine at the local board of canvassers. Voters have up to 20 days before the election to vote in this manner.

He also introduced a resolution that created a special legislative commission to study privacy protection on the Internet. The 11-member Rhode Island Online Data Transparency and Privacy Protection Commission studied and made recommendations on legislation for protecting individuals from disclosures of information.

Representative Shanley graduated from Toll Gate High School in 2005 and earned a bachelor’s degree in political science and history from Providence College in 2009. He earned his juris doctor from Catholic University in 2012. He practices law with the firm Gursky/Wiens.​

Born Oct. 17, 1986, he and his wife, Meredith (Garrity), reside in Warwick with their son, Maxwell, and daughter, Lucille.​​​
