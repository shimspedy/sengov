Representative Carol Hagan McEntee (D-Dist. 33, South Kingstown and Narragansett) was first elected in June 2015, after winning a special election to fill the vacant District 33 seat. She is the chair of the House Small Business Committee and is the first vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee. Representative McEntee is also a member of the House Labor Committee and the House Environment and Natural Resources Committee.

During the 2023 legislative session, Representative McEntee was the main sponsor of a new law that extends the “Take it Outside." outdoor dining initative in the state.​ She also sponsored legislation which would eliminate the statute of limitations for second degree sexual assault in criminal proceedings.

Also in 2023, Representative McEntee was named the co-chair of the Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study and Provide Recommendations to Protect Our Environment and Natural Resources from Plastic Bottle Waste and she was honored by Clean Water Action as an “Environmental Champion” for her work promoting environmental protection and sustainability.

In 2022, Representative McEntee was the prime sponsor on several new laws. She introduced The Plastic Waste Reduction Act, which is designed to reduce the use of plastic checkout bags by retail establishments by offering recyclable bag options and providing penalties for violations.

She also introduced the new law which establishes criminal penalties for a wanton or reckless act or omission of a parent, guardian or any other person who has custody or control of a child, where those acts or omissions result in substantial risk of serious bodily injury to the child or sexual abuse of a child in their care. She also was the main sponsor of the new “Take it Outside” law which allows restaurants to continue approved outdoor dining that was established during the pandemic.

Representative McEntee was honored by the Partnership to Reduce Cancer in Rhode Island with the House Champion Partnership Award. She was recognized for sponsoring and shepherding the Genetic Counselors Licensing Act into law during the 2022 legislative session. The law ensures minimum standards for genetic counselors in the areas of academic training, certification, clinical experience and the delivery of high-quality genetic counseling services.​


Representative McEntee was also honored by the Rhode Island Hospitality Association as the organization’s 2022 Hospitality Ambassador of the Year for her advocacy in the “Take it Outside” initiative and the legislation she sponsored which reduced unemployment taxes for Rhode Island’s small businesses.​

In 2019, Representative McEntee championed the enactment of a bill she sponsored that extends the civil statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse. She was honored by Day One with the advocacy organization’s Spotlight Award due to her sponsorship of the new law.

Representative McEntee served as a member of the South Kingstown Town Council from 2008 until June 2015. She is an attorney at law, licensed in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

A graduate of the University of Rhode Island, Representative McEntee has lived in Wakefield and Bonnet Shores for more than 30 years. She is married to Mike McEntee, a former State Representative, and they have three children: Meg, Mickey and Rory, who is a member of the South Kingstown Town Council.
