Kathleen A. Fogarty (D) was first elected in November 2014 to the seat in House District 35, South Kingstown. She is the chair of the House Special Legislation Committee and is a member of the House Environment and Natural Resources Committee, the House Health and Human Services Committee and the House Municipal Government and Housing Committee.

During the 2023 session, she sponsored a law that mandates insurance coverage for any screenings deemed medically necessary for any person who has received notice of dense breast tissue in accordance with applicable American College of Radiology guidelines.

The 2022 session saw many of Representative Fogarty’s initiatives signed into law, including bills protecting the environment, mental health access, and elderly rights. She sponsored a new law to improve the safety of dams throughout the state by requiring the State Building Code Standards Committee to take into account the effect of climate change on inundation areas below dams. She introduced a law that addresses the shortage of mental health counselors by creating a two-tiered licensing structure. She also sponsored a law that makes it easier for senior citizens to apply for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.​

A longtime advocate for the University of Rhode Island, Representative Fogarty championed a $50 million bond to fund repairs and construct new facilities at the University of Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay Campus to help URI reach its true potential in oceanographic education and research. She also introduced a new law that allows university trustee members to remotely participate in meetings.​

During the 2021 session, she sponsored a new law that helps commercial fisheries by allowing for the direct dockside sale of fish.

In 2017, Chairwoman Fogarty introduced a law that bans the use of hand-held mobile devices while operating a motor vehicle. The new law took effect on June 1, 2018.

In 2016, she introduced legislation that requires elementary schools to have at least 20 minutes of free play recess during the school day. The new law defines free play as being in an unstructured environment supervised by appropriate school personnel.

Prior to her election to the House of Representatives, she was a member of the South Kingstown Town Council from 2002 to 2012, serving as the council president from 2008 to 2010 and as the vice president from 2004 to 2008.

Born July 29, 1965, she and her husband, Brendan J. Fogarty, have two children, Brendan and Lauren.
