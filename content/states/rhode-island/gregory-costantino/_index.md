Gregory J. Costantino (D) was first elected to represent District 44 – serving the people of Lincoln, Smithfield and Johnston – in November 2012. He is the second vice chair of the House Small Business Committee.

During the 2023 session, he introduced a law that enables Rhode Islanders over the age of 21 to access existing table games remotely via a computer or a mobile app. Players will have to be located within the state of Rhode Island.​​​​

In 2022, he championed a bond referendum, which was later approved by voters, that calls for moving all elementary students into a new school and constructing an early childhood center. It also renovates the Nicholas A. Ferri Middle School and Johnston Senior High School.

During the 2018 session, Representative Costantino sponsored a law that requires the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles to send motorists notice to renew their registrations even when they owe back taxes. The longstanding practice had changed when the DMV installed a new computer system.


Since the beginning of his tenure, Representative Costantino has supported a wide range of legislation aimed at increasing government efficiency and boosting commerce. This includes 2014 legislation to impose higher standards of accountability and transparency on quasi-public corporations.

During his time in the House, Representative Costantino has shown a particular concern for veterans and public safety officials. In 2015, he sponsored legislation that increases the tax exemption for war veterans in the town of Smithfield from $4,000 to $10,000. In that same session, he co-sponsored a bill that prohibits employers from firing an employee who failed to report to work when responding to an emergency while serving as a volunteer firefighter.

The state representative was born on August 11, 1960, graduated from La Salle Academy in 1978 and attended Providence College.

Married to Lisa (Ronci), they are the parents of three children, Sofia, Camille and Gregory, and live in Lincoln.​
