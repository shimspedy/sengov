Rep. Jacquelyn Baginski (D-Dist. 17, Cranston) was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives in November 2020. She was named the chair of the House Innovation, Internet and Technology Committee in January 2023, and she is a member of the House Finance Committee and the House State Government and Election​s Committee.

In 2023, she was named as the Legislator of the Year by the Mental Health Association of R.I. and was recognized by the Hospital Association of Rhode Island with the 2023 Francis R. Dietz Award for Public Service. She was honored by both organizations for her leadership on securing funding in the FY 2023 state budget for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. The budget item was based on legislation Representative Baginski introduced earlier in the legislative session.

During the 2023 session, Representative Baginski sponsored a new law which allows sports wagering on in-state collegiate teams when they are participating in tournaments that consist of four or more teams, such as the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.

In 2022, Representative Baginski introduced a new law which allows the repurposing of vacant schools for affordable housing. She also was the main sponsor of the law which will permanently allow restaurants and brewpubs to sell wine, beer and mixed drinks with takeout food orders.

Born on November 10, 1985, she is a graduate of the Moses Brown School in Providence and of George Washington University in 2008.

She is the director of sales and marketing for Professional Ambulance and she is the director of Dardan Consulting. She also teaches CPR to children.
