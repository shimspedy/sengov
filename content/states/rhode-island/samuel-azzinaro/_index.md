Samuel A. Azzinaro (D) has served the residents of District 37 in Westerly since first being elected in November 2008. He is the chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and also serves as a member of the House Health and Human Services Committee, the House Rules Committee and the House Special Legislation Committee.

During the 2023 legislative session, Chairman Azzinaro sponsored a new law which explicitly gives members of the United States National Guard the same tax benefits available to other qualifying military veterans. The law allows National Guard veterans to qualify for the same property tax exemptions as active duty personnel, provided that the veteran meets the service requirements outlined in the statute.

He also introduced a bill which would require employers to post basic information on veterans' benefits and services within their businesses for their employees.

In 2022, Chairman Azzinaro’s bill which makes “stolen valor” a crime was signed into law. The law makes it a crime to fraudulently represent oneself as an active or veteran member of the military or armed forces for the purpose of obtaining money, property or other tangible benefits. He was also responsible for the inclusion of funding for a mobile Division of Motor Vehicles unit within the FY 2023 state budget to serve the town of Westerly.


He was also instrumental in creating the Westerly Higher Education and Job Skills Center. He helped to develop the concept for the center, obtain the funding, and secured partnerships with colleges and businesses to train individuals in high skilled manufacturing jobs.

Representative Azzinaro previously served for 12 years on the Westerly Town Council, including four years as its president.

He served in the National Guard for four years, and was a member of the Army Reserve for four years, including two years of active duty. He was a Staff Sergeant E6.

Representative Azzinaro was born on January 29, 1943. The father of five is a retired textile worker, business owner and carpenter, and resides in Westerly with his wife, Carol. They are the parents of five children, Tami Algiere, Amy Azzinaro, Lori Gulluscio, Samuel J. Azzinaro and Mary Azzinaro-Banks; and are the grandparents of 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
