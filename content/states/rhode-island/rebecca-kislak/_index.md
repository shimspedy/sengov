Representative Rebecca Kislak (D) was first elected to represent District 4 in Providence in November 2018. She is the second vice chair of the House Education Committee and is a member of the House Environment and Natural Resources Committee, the House Health and Human Services Committee, and the House Innovation, Internet and Technology Committee.

Representative Kislak has been​ an outspoken supporter of Providence’s public schools, health equity, and economic justice. In 2021, Representative Kislak sponsored a law creating a permanent commission to promote and continually improve genocide and Holocaust education in schools. She successfully advocated for the Rhode Island Parentage Act, legislation that made Rhode Island law more inclusive to recognize the many ways people become families, and sponsored a subsequent streamlining of adoption laws to better protect families with children born through assisted reproduction. In 2022, she led a successful effort to restrict the use of neonicotinoids in pesticides, and she continues to work on an effort to join the majority of states in adopting national standards for e-bikes and legislation to improve the legal infrastructure for bicycle transportation. In 2023, she introduced the Green Buildings Act, which aims to create energy performance standards based on the size of buildings, and cosponsored a new law that now protects many of the consumer-protection aspects of the federal Affordable Care Act in Rhode Island by enacting them at the state level.

Representative Kislak is an attorney with years of experience in law and policy. She is a Law and Policy Consultant with MLPB, was a founding attorney of the Medical-Legal Partnership at Community Legal Aid in Worcester, and director of the Rhode Island Medical-Legal Partnership at Rhode Island Legal Services. She also served as Policy Director and Counsel at the Rhode Island Health Center Association, and has worked as a consultant for health care and non-profit organizations. She teaches health policy courses as an adjunct professor at Rhode Island College and Brown University.​​

She earned a bachelor’s degree from Brown University in 1995 and graduated from Georgetown University Law Center in 2000. She is married to Dr. Joanna Brown.
