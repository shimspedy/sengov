Brianna E. Henries was elected on November 3, 2020 to represent the people of District 64 in East Providence. She is a member of the House Labor Committee and the House Special Legislation Committee.

A lifelong Rhode Islander who represents a working-class district and who has experienced homelessness herself, her focus at the State House is on lifting people out of poverty and ensuring that income doesn't determine a person's basic human rights. Her legislative work focuses on expanding housing availability, particularly for those with low incomes; raising the minimum wage; giving marginalized communities the opportunity to thrive, ensuring that affordable health care is available and accessible to all, changing school funding so that Zip codes do not determine the quality of a student's education, and advocating for small business entrepreneurs, especially those in the beauty industry.

In her first term in the House, the General Assembly adopted her legislation requiring that newborn health screenings include tests for all conditions for which there is a medical benefit to early detection and treatment, as well as her bill granting an income tax exemption for artists within the East Providence art district. She was a cosponsor of the 2022 laws prohibiting tip theft by employers and establishing trauma-informed practices in schools statewide. She was the sponsor of the 2023 legislation that designated Juneteenth as a state holiday.

Born February 27, 1991, Representative Henries is a 2009 Classical High School graduate. A makeup artist by trade, she is involved in several small business ventures, including bridal services and freelance makeup, branding and social media management. She volunteers writing and assisting with productions at Valiant Arts Studio in Pawtucket.

She and her fiancé live in East Providence with their dog, Cooper.
