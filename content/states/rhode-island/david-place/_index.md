David J. Place was unanimously elected to serve as the Minority Whip, the second-highest ranking leadership position within the delegation, in June, 2022.

Whip Place was re-elected to the House of Representatives in November 2020, representing the residents of District 47, which includes Burrillville and Glocester. He serves on six House standing committees, which include the Judiciary Committee; the Innovation, Internet and Technology Committee; the Conduct Committee; the Rules Committee; the Health and Human Services Committee; and the Veterans' Affairs Committee​.

Place firmly protects local interests when balancing the needs of other cities and towns across the Ocean State, especially when it comes to the distribution of state resources. During his freshman year in the General Assembly (2019) he supported legislation that reduced taxes, bettered core-government functions and endorsed initiatives that promoted a more robust economic climate in Rhode Island.

Place served on the Burrillville Town Council from 2010 to 2018 and was also a member of the Harrisville Fire District Operations Committee from 2015 to 2018.

Place served 10 years as a U.S. Army staff sergeant, assigned as a tank commander on an M1A1 Abrams.  He was deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom II and was decorated for leadership and heroism while in combat.

Upon returning home, Place graduated from Rhode Island College with a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting. A former machinist, Place is a full-time stay-at-home dad.

Place resides in Harrisville and is married to Erin Todisco-Place. They are the parents of daughters, Michelle and Amalia and son, Warren.​
