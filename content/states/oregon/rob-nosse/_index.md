Rob Nosse is currently the state representative for HD 42, which consists of inner SE and a little sliver of NE Portland.  He has been the state representative for this area of Portland since 2014. He has recently served on the Ways and Means Committee, where he is the sub-committee co-chair for human services, and he also serves as Vice Chair of the House Behavioral Health Care Committee.  With those two roles Representative Nosse was able to steer over one billion dollars in federal and state marijuana revenues into a series of behavioral health bills and budgets, one of the largest investments in behavioral and mental health in decades during the 2021 and 2022 sessions.  He was recently apointed serve as the chair of the House Health Care Committee.  He is also one of two Majority Whips, a role that is responsible for working with other members of the Democratic Caucus to check in on bills and priorities to make sure that there is support for passage when final votes come.

Rob lives in SE Portland with his husband Jim.  He is an activist/advocate at heart.  He has worked his entire working life trying to make positive social change for students and working families that improves their lives.  He started out as a student organizer in the 80s and 90s with the Oregon Student Association trying to support public higher education.  More recently, Rob worked at the Oregon Nurses Association where, for almost twenty years, he advocated for working people and nurses as a union representative.  He is happy to say that while collective bargaining is sometimes a contentious process, he believes in the end he had mostly good working relationships with the employers -- hospitals and county health departments, even when things were contentious.  He is the proud father of two Portland Public Schools alumni, and the grandfather of three prospective PPS students.

Rob has been an activist on LGBTQ+ rights since he moved here to work for the Oregon Student Association in 1992 (he grew up in Ohio).  He successfully brought students from every part of the state together to fight Ballot Measure 9, a discriminatory right-wing measure to establish a strong anti-gay culture in Oregon.  Before joinging the legislature, he served as a board member of Basic Rights Oregon Equality PAC helping elect pro-LGBTQ+ candidates to elected office and worked to bring marriage equality to our state.  

Rob is honored to be your State Representative. Please contact him with your questions, comments & concerns at rep.robnosse@oregonlegislature.gov and (503) 986-1442.
