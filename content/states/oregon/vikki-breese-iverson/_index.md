Vikki Breese-Iverson is an American politician and businesswoman who served as the minority leader of the Oregon House of Representatives. A member of the Republican party, she represents the 59th district, which includes Prineville in Central Oregon.

Born in 1973 or 1974 in Prineville, Oregon, Breese-Iverson is a 5th generation rural Oregonian. She and her husband Bryan are raising their two boys on the same ranch she grew up on and they are deeply involved in their community. They own and operate several small businesses, including his advertising agency, her real estate agency, a coffee shop, and a wholesale all-natural beef company.

Breese-Iverson joined the 80th Oregon Legislative Assembly after being appointed on August 8, 2019 to replace Mike McLane. She owns a real estate business in Prineville. She had previously worked for former Oregon State Senator Ted Ferrioli and former Oregon State House Speaker Karen Minnis.

She won re-election in 2020 by a large margin, 73.5% of the vote. Breese-Iverson has cast doubt on the validity of the 2020 presidential election results. On December 11, 2020, Breese-Iverson and 11 other state Republican officials signed a letter requesting Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum join Texas and other states contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election in Texas v. Pennsylvania.

In 2021, Breese-Iverson sent a letter to Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, requesting a "full forensic audit" of Oregon's 2020 elections. In November 2021, she signed a letter along with other Republicans around the nation calling for an audit of the 2020 election in all states.

On November 30, 2021, Breese-Iverson became the House minority leader, after Christine Drazan stepped down from the office to run for governor. She served in this role until September 2023 when she stepped-down due to rumors of her being unseated. She was replaced by Jeff Helfrich.

Following the Standoff at Eagle Pass, Breese-Iverson signed a letter in support of Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision in the conflict.
