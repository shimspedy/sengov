During his career as an editorial photographer, Mark was sent around the world to capture images of exciting adventures and beautiful locations. Decades ago, he was seeing undeniable signs of increasing drought, bleaching coral reefs, melting glaciers, significant weather disturbances, and other indicators of climate change across the globe. In spite of very clear warnings from the scientific community, he saw governments and businesses doing virtually nothing to address the impending threat.

Climate change was the core reason Mark first ran for Milwaukie City Council and it remains his top motivator to this day. During his eight years as Mayor of that city he championed causes ranging from urban tree canopy protections, to advancing racial justice in the city bureaucracy, to building out bike and pedestrian infrastructure, and more.

Mark is one of the few renters currently serving in the Oregon State Legislature and he is of modest means. These perspectives inform his policy positions and he strives to keep poor and working-class families centered in his lawmaking at all times.
