Jeffrey Allen Helfrich, born in April 1968, is a dedicated public servant and the Minority Leader of the Oregon House of Representatives. As a member of the Republican party, he represents the 52nd district, which covers all of Hood River County and parts of Clackamas, Multnomah, and Wasco counties.

Helfrich's journey of public service began with his time in the United States Air Force, where he served as an airman during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. After his military service, he joined the Portland Police Bureau and served for 25 years, retiring with the rank of sergeant.

In addition to his military and law enforcement service, Helfrich has also been active in local government. He served on the Cascade Locks City Council from his appointment in 2011 until November 2012. He was again appointed in February 2013 and served until June 2015, when he resigned and moved to Hood River.

Helfrich's political career at the state level began when he was appointed to serve the remainder of the term of the incumbent Oregon State Representative Mark Johnson, who resigned in November 2017. Helfrich ran for a full two-year term in 2018, but was defeated by Democrat Anna Williams. In 2020, he lost a rematch with Williams. However, in 2022, Williams retired and Helfrich defeated Darcy Long to reclaim the seat.

In September 2023, Helfrich was elected minority leader of the Oregon House of Representatives, replacing Vikki Breese-Iverson who stepped down a week prior. This position holds one of the most competitive seats in the House.

Helfrich was born in Denver, Colorado, and now resides in Hood River, Oregon, with his wife Shawna and their two young children. Throughout his career, Helfrich has always prioritized the needs of families and communities. He is committed to meeting the district's needs and achieving its education, economic, housing, environmental, and emergency services goals.
