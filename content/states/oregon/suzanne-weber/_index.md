Suzanne Weber is an American politician serving as the senator from Oregon's 16th Senate district. She won in the general election on November 8, 2022, and assumed office on January 9, 2023. She is a member of the Republican party. Oregon senators serve four-year terms.

Weber moved to Tillamook, Oregon in 1970 to escape the cold weather of the Midwest. She taught first through third grade children for 30 years. She has also operated two small businesses and served on the Tillamook City Council before being appointed as mayor. As Tillamook Mayor, she focused on economic development issues that are critical to the rural communities in Senate District 16.

In November 2020, Weber won the seat for Oregon's 32nd House district after incumbent Democrat Tiffiny Mitchell decided not to run for re-election. She defeated Democrat Debbie Boothe-Schmidt in the 2020 election, winning 54.1% to 45.7% with 0.2% of the vote being for write-in candidates.

In November 2022, Weber beat Democratic newcomer Melissa Busch to replace former Democratic Senator Betsy Johnson, who resigned to run for governor. In May 2023, Senator Weber joined other republican senators in protest against House Bill 2002, which aimed to protect reproductive rights and gender affirming care. The walkout paralyzed the state government by denying the legislature a quorum, resulting in gridlock.

On May 18, Weber reached the 10 unexcused absence threshold set by measure 113, disqualifying her from running for re-election after her current term ends. Weber and 4 other Senators filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade in response, arguing that the measure's wording allowed them to serve one additional term before being barred from re-election. On February 1, 2024, the Court unanimously ruled against the Republican Senators, confirming Weber's disqualification after her current term ends in January 2027.

Following the Standoff at Eagle Pass, Weber signed a letter in support of Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision in the conflict.
