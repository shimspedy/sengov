John D. Lively, born on November 30, 1946, in La Grande, Oregon, is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Oregon House of Representatives. He has been representing District 12 since January 14, 2013.

Lively was born in LaGrande and lived in Wallowa until he was a junior in high school. Due to limited economic opportunities in Wallowa, his family moved to Springfield where his dad started working at Alexander's Department Store. He graduated from Thurston High School, Lane Community College, and the University of Oregon. His college education was interrupted by the Vietnam War, during which he spent four years in the Army Security Agency. After his service, he graduated from the University of Oregon and married Tresa Brotherton. They have been married for 50 years and raised their daughters in Springfield. Now, their four grandchildren are also being raised there.

Lively's career includes being the Mayor of Springfield and many years working in economic development. He has also worked for manufacturing companies and contact center management. His work in the private sector has provided him with firsthand knowledge of the challenges of maintaining good wages and benefits for people. This experience has been invaluable in his ability to understand differing perspectives and approaches to problem-solving.

He has been serving in the State Legislature since 2013. His years of service have reinforced that only by working together can we improve. Springfield is a community that listens, works across the aisle, and is never afraid to ask the tough questions. Lively always does his best to reflect this in his work at the State Legislature. He believes in local control and understands that one size does not fit all. It's why elected officials and decision-makers in the region have his direct line.

Lively's volunteer service includes Lane Workforce Partnership, United Way, Western Rivers Girl Scout Council, Strong Schools for Springfield, and many more. Each has helped him gain knowledge about the community and what he can do to help. He believes that service to his community is the way to make a difference.
