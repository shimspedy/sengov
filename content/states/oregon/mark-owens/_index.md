Representative Mark Owens is the Republican state representative for Oregon's House District 60. He is a local farmer, small business owner, Crane School Board Member, and former Harney County Commissioner.

During the 2023 interim, Mark is Vice-Chair of the House Interim Committee On Agriculture, Land Use, Natural Resources, and Water. He also serves on the Joint Emergency Board, and on the House Interim Committee On Climate, Energy, and Environment, and as an alternate on the House Interim Committee on Conduct and the Joint Committee. He also serves as House Republican Deputy Leader.

Eastern Oregon has been Mark's home for over 32 years, but his history in the community goes back much farther. Although he grew up in Boring, Oregon, Mark spent his summers as a teenager working on a ranch in Harney County before moving here as a young adult, meeting his wife, and making frontier Oregon their home. He currently owns and operates an alfalfa farm and custom haying business in Harney County.

When not working on his farm, running his small businesses, or serving in public capacities, Mark enjoys traveling with his family, visiting his daughter in college, watching his son play sports, and fishing.

House District 60 encompasses all of Baker, Grant, Harney, Lake and Malheur Counties, and parts of Deschutes County.
