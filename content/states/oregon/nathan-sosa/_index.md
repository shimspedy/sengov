Nathan was raised by a single mom in a working-class family. They never had much money. For many years, they didn’t even own a car. At sixteen years old, he started bagging groceries to help support his mom and little brother. He then worked two jobs to put himself through college as well as law school. These experiences instilled in him a dedication to family, a commitment to hard work, and an understanding of the challenges faced by those who live paycheck-to-paycheck.  

Nathan became a lawyer to help people. Over the past thirteen years, he’s devoted his legal career to protecting the rights of those who have been harmed.  

Nathan has also spent countless hours volunteering in the community. He has served as chair of the Oregon Government Ethics Commission, president of the Hillsboro Schools Foundation, member of the Hillsboro 2035 Community Plan Oversight Committee, ambassador with the Washington County Chamber of Commerce, and a youth mentor with Portland State University as well as Lewis and Clark Law School. He’s honored to continue his public service as a state representative.
