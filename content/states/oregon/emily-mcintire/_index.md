Emily was born and raised in Jackson County. She spent her first years in Trail, OR and has lived the last 30 years in Eagle Point. Emily is married to her husband, Ryan, and they have 2 kids. Emily is actively engaged in her local church and centers her life around Jesus. "My goal is to love people the way Jesus does."

Politics was never in Emily's purview, but as her youngest was starting school, they decided to attend their local public school. This began Emily's journey with running for her local school board and becoming passionate about advocating for community driven practices and priorities in her district. She is in her 2nd term on the school board and continues to advocate for local control to serve her community.

Over the past year Emily has immersed herself in District 56. Spending significant time in Klamath County, working to understand agriculture and water issues. Talking to local officials, constituents, and pretty much anyone who would talk to her. People are her priority and advocating for their needs, their freedoms, is her heart.

"It's about people not politics. I am here for you and invite you to reach out to me with any questions, comments, or concerns."

Emily is honored to be your representative and looks forward to serving you!â€‹
