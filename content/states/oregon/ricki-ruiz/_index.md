Representative Ricki Ruiz, one of Oregon's youngest state legislators, proudly represents House District 50, encompassing Gresham and East Portland. Born in Portland and raised in Gresham by immigrant parents, Ricki attended Reynolds School District, becoming the first in his family to graduate high school.

He earned his B.S. in Social Entrepreneurship from Portland Community College & Warner Pacific University in 2016. As a college student, Ricki co-founded the Rockwood Initiative, securing over $100,000 to build futsal courts in the community. Elected as the youngest school board member in Reynolds School District in 2017, Ricki is now dedicated to serving the constituents of House District 50 and advancing policies in education, housing, immigration, climate, racial justice, healthcare, and the economy. As the Co-Chair of the Oregon BIPOC Caucus, Ricki successfully secured several budget allocations, including $5 million for Individual Development Accounts and funding for initiatives like Water Equity, Employment Related Day Care, Albina Vision Trust, and others.

He currently serves as the Vice-Chair of the House Committee On Higher Education and is a member of the Joint Committee On Ways and Means Subcommittee On Education and the House Committee On Economic Development and Small Business.â€‹
