Jami Cate is a lifelong resident of Lebanon, and a 5th generation farmer in Linn County. Working alongside her family, she raises grass seed and looks forward to the long hours spent running combines every summer. Jami also has a seed cleaning warehouse where she processes her farm’s seed in preparation for shipping across the country, and around the world.

A graduate of Oregon State University, Jami is a proud “Beaver Believer.” Between her degree in Crop and Soil Science and career on the farm, Jami is a strong advocate for the importance of the agriculture industry to Oregon’s overall economy.

While not on the farm, Jami has dedicated much of her free time to volunteering and being active in her community. She has served on the board of directors for groups like the Lebanon Strawberry Festival, Lebanon Museum Foundation, and Lebanon Community Foundation.

Jami loves that so much of House District 11 is covered in trees, and not just for the economic value its timber products bring to her communities, but also for the abundant recreation opportunities it offers to residents. As an avid hiker and mountain climber, Jami enjoys spending her down time in our district’s vast wilderness.

Running for State Representative and heading to Salem may seem an unexpected shift for this volunteering-farmer, but Jami is beyond honored to have the opportunity to represent the communities of House District 11 and looks forward to being a voice for our rural way of life in Salem.
