Oregon State Representative Annessa Hartman (she/her) is a member of the Haudenosaunee, Cayuga Nation, Snipe Clan, and the third Indigenous person elected to the Oregon House of Representatives.

Representative Hartman serves House District 40, including Oregon City, Gladstone, and Unincorporated Clackamas County. Representative Hartman’s legislative focus includes supporting working families, human services, and infrastructure, which stems from her experiences as the child of a single, working mother, being a military brat, and being a Gladstone City Councilor.

Transparency, accessibility, and amplifying historically unheard voices are guiding values that have impacted her work to diligently view policy from an equitable lens, empowering others to speak their stories to local leadership.

Representative Hartman’s background in events and hospitality has enabled her to utilize her strengths in planning, goal setting, collaboration, and communication. Hospitality can be a thankless calling-like leadership that builds small wins and eventually leads to monumental change with diligence, focus, and humility.​
