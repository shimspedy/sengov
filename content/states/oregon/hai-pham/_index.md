Representative Hai Pham is a Democrat serving District 36, which includes South Hillsboro and West Beaverton. He is humbled by the opportunity to serve the constituents of Hillsboro, Beaverton, and Washington County. As someone who immigrated to this country as an infant and refugee, he never thought he would be serving in public office.

Hai Pham's story dates back to 1980 when he came to the U.S. with his family as a one-year-old refugee from Vietnam. A year prior, his parents escaped on a boat into the open ocean, not knowing if they were going to survive the journey. He was born, not long after, in a modest grass hut in a refugee camp in Malaysia. Determined to get to the United States, his parents were eventually sponsored by a church and immigrated to Corvallis. From that moment on, Oregon has been his home.

Growing up, his family didn't have much, so he focused on studying hard in school and made his way through Oregon State University. He then completed his dental degree and specialty training at Oregon Health & Sciences University and Doernbecher. Just before his residency, he was diagnosed with Leukemia and wasted away for months because he could not afford the copays for his cancer treatment. This only furthered his passion for health system reforms as he struggled to pay medical bills and survive.

Thanks to the pioneering research of Dr. Brian Drucker's team at OHSU's Knight Cancer Institute, he has been able to lead a fulfilling life as a cancer survivor. His life experiences have also helped shape him as a healthcare provider - he started his dental practice to provide care for the underserved children of Washington County, and since then, he has expanded the practice to serve children from all around the state.

He loves Oregon and brings his experiences as a parent, healthcare provider, and business owner to the legislature to serve the people of House District 36 and build a better future for us all. His office is here to help, so please don't hesitate to reach out.
