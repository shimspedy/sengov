Andrea Valderrama is a Peruvian–American politician who is currently serving as the Oregon state representative in Oregon's 47th district. She was appointed to the seat after incumbent Democrat Diego Hernandez resigned. Prior to her time in the Oregon House of Representatives, she was the chair of the David Douglas School Board and a former staffer to Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. On January 16, 2022, Valderrama was chosen as the Deputy Majority Whip in the House.

Valderrama represents Outer East Portland (HD 47). The district sits on the traditional lands of the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas Bands of the Chinook and many other tribes who made their home along the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. She has lived in House District 47 for nearly a decade and is committed to building a better future for all children and families. As a mother and someone who knows from direct experience how difficult the COVID-19 crisis has been, she is determined to fight to ensure communities get the relief they need. She will not stop working until the opportunities to thrive are accessible and truly equitable for all Oregonians.

She leads with her values of racial, economic, disability​ and gender justice and continues this legislative session to advocate for affordable housing, access to quality education, comprehensive and accessible healthcare services, equitable economic recovery, community safety, and climate resiliency. When she took office in April 2021, she helped bring women into the majority of the House of Representatives for the first time in Oregon’s history.

In addition to serving as Representative for House District 47, she works as the Strategic Planning and Initiatives Director at the ACLU of Oregon. She is proud to have an extensive background in grassroots organizing, coalition building, and policy and budget advocacy. She holds a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Oregon and a Master of Public Administration from Portland State University. Her office values are centered within Incan communal values and principles and include ayni (reciprocity), yachay (knowing), munay (love), llank'ay (work).
