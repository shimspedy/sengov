Courtney Neron is an American politician from Oregon. A Democrat, she represents District 26 in the Oregon House of Representatives. This district is located in northern Oregon and includes portions of Clackamas County and Washington County. She was first elected in 2018.

Neron was born in Tigard, Oregon and attended the University of Oregon. She taught high school French and Spanish. Neron was named as the replacement candidate for the district on July 28, 2018, after Ryan Spiker dropped out after winning the Democratic primary. In the general election, Neron defeated her Republican opponent, incumbent representative Rich Vial, securing 50.8% of the vote to become the new Representative for the district. With her election she became the first Democrat to represent the district in 18 years, the last being Kathy Lowe, who served in the Legislature from 2000 to 2002. She sits on the House Education Committee, the House Committee on Early Childhood, and the House Committee on Housing, during the 81st session.

Neron lives in Wilsonville with her two children. She attended Tigard schools, graduated from the University of Oregon with a French degree and Pacific University with a Masters in Teaching. After student teaching in Yamhill-Carlton and Tigard-Tualatin School Districts, she taught French and Spanish at Tualatin High School, Reading and Special Education in Milton-Freewaterâ€‹, and ultimately returned to her alma mater Tigard High School to teach world languages once again. Her own children attend Wilsonville schools and she is grateful for their teachers and our communities who invest in public education through local bonds and levies.

In her seat in the House of Representatives, Neron wants to ensure that our public schools have stable funding from cradle to career and adequate state resources to tackle our most pressing classroom challenges. In her first term, she helped pass the Student Success Act, bringing critically needed investments into our schools to lower class size, increase behavioral health supports and strategically target learning disparities. She will continue to work hard to fund the education that our students and teachers deserve. She will work toward safer communities, logical transportation solutions and necessary environmental protections.
