Kayse Jama is an American politician currently serving as a Democratic member of the Oregon State Senate, representing Oregon's 24th Senate district, which includes parts of Clackamas and Multnomah Counties. He was appointed by the Clackamas and Multnomah County Board of Commissioners to replace Shemia Fagan, who was elected Oregon Secretary of State in 2021.

Jama was born into a nomadic family in Somalia. At eight years old, he moved to the capital, Mogadishu, to begin his education. Jama graduated from high school just as the civil war erupted, and he lived as a refugee for several years before arriving in San Diego in 1998. He settled in Portland, Oregon, shortly thereafter.

In the United States, Jama began working at the Lutheran Community Services Northwest helping new refugees adapt to life. He received a bachelor's degree in sociology from Marylhurst University.

In 2021, Jama stepped down as Executive Director of Unite Oregon after being appointed to the Oregon State Senate. He replaced State Senator Shemia Fagan, who was elected to serve as Oregon Secretary of State. Jama represents Senate District 24 which comprises East Portland and North Clackamas. He is the first Muslim to serve in the Oregon State Legislature and the first former refugee to serve in the Oregon State Senate.

From 2005 to 2007, he trained immigrant and refugee community leaders in five Western states—Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Utah and Idaho—under a prestigious New Voices Fellowship at Western States Center.

In 2002, Kayse Jama co-founded the Center for Intercultural Organizing, now Unite Oregon, after witnessing racial incidents in Portland following the September 11 attacks in 2001. Jama served as the director of the statewide nonprofit organization until 2021. While at Unite Oregon, Jama led community organizing and ballot measure campaigns to reduce the influence of money in politics, end police profiling, reform Oregon's hate crime laws, and expand drug treatment.

Jama is the chair of the Senate Committee On Housing and Development, and he serves on the Senate Committee On Labor and Business, and the Joint Committee On Ways and Means Subcommittee On Transportation and Economic Development.
