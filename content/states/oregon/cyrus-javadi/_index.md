Cyrus Javadi is an American Republican politician currently serving the 32nd district in the Oregon House of Representatives. He was elected on November 8, 2022, running against Democrat Logan Laity.

Born in Provo, Utah, Cyrus moved to New England during his childhood. As a teenager, he moved back to Utah to attend high school and college. He earned a degree in accounting and did financial and tax work. After earning his dental degree in 2008, he moved to Astoria to begin his career at a local dentistâ€™s office.

In 2023, Cyrus assumed office as a member of the Oregon House of Representatives from the 32nd district. His predecessor was Suzanne Weber. Cyrus's career took a turn when he moved to Astoria and started working at a local dentist's office. The economy made him move to Texas, but he eventually moved back and came back to Oregon, this time in Tillamook. He is the Dental Director for the Tillamook County Health Department.

Cyrus is a longtime Oregon resident, first moving to the coast in 2008, originally living in Astoria and now residing in Tillamook. He earned his Bachelor's degree in accounting and worked in the financial industry, before pursuing his passion for healthcare and earning his Doctorate in dental surgery. He currently operates a private dental practice in Tillamook.

In his free time, Cyrus enjoys wearing his pilot hat and flying around the beautiful State of Oregon. He's an avid golfer, pianist, painter, and dedicated husband and father to his blended family of nine children. He has served as a Commissioner for the Port of Tillamook, the Dental Director for the Tillamook County Health Department, the Secretary for the Oregon Dental Association, and a member of the ODA Board of Trustees.

Cyrus Javadi lives in Tillamook, Oregon. He is of Iranian descent.
