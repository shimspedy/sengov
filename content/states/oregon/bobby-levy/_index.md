Bobby Levy was born in​ La Grande, Oregon and raised in Umatilla County. Spending her entire life in Eastern Oregon, Bobby understands why the rural way of life should be valued and protected. The fourth of six children, Bobby grew up hunting, fishing and camping and feels fortunate to have spent her time in a place so rich with outdoor beauty and bounty.

Never one to settle, Bobby follows the mantra of always asking herself "what next?" After her kids were in grade school, Bobby pursued higher education. First getting a Master's in business administration from Portland State University, then a Master's in teacher education from Eastern Oregon University. Bobby has had many careers ranging from licensed insurance agent, adjunct professor at BMCC,  farmer/rancher and large breed guardian dog breeder.

While teaching at BMCC, she was appointed to serve as commissioner on Oregon Department and Wildlife.  During her eight year term, she served two years as vice chair and one as chair.  It was during this time that it was becoming evident the divide between rural and urban Oregon was growing.  Bobby and her friends decided to found the non-profit Eastern Oregon Women's Coalition to advocate for rural Oregon issues. Since 2006, Bobby has been inviting legislators and industry leaders to Eastern Oregon to participate in tours and learn about industry practices, agricultural technology, and predator populations. In 2019, Eastern Oregon Women's Coalition hosted the first successful Eastern Oregon Economic Summit, bringing Oregonians from all over the state to learn about housing, water, forestry, and economic development in Eastern Oregon.

Bobby is member of the National Women in Agriculture as well as Oregon Women in Agriculture and the Umatilla County Women in Agriculture chapter. Bobby knows that the only way to preserve the rural way of life is to reach across the aisle and find common ground. ​

Bobby and her husband Bob live on their farm in Echo.  She and her husband relax by spending time with their sheep and guardian dogs.  Together they have 4 children and 14 grandchildren, who also keep them busy.
