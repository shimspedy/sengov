Anna works on a 4th generation family farm just outside of Salem. She focuses on human resources, contract management, inventory management, and agriculture advocacy efforts. She also served as a Legislative Policy Analyst for HD23 during the 2020 and 2021 Legislative Sessions.

Anna holds an MBA in International Business and a bachelorâ€™s degree in Political Science. The bulk of her professional career was spent working for large international companies in supply chain and business relations. However, her original undergraduate focus was on state and local politics. Her first career after graduating with her degree in Political Science was as a lobbyist in Salem. Her work for the family farm brought her back to advocating for various issues and ultimately to where she is today.

Anna currently serves on multiple regional and national boards including the Pacific NW Canola Association (OR, WA, ID, MT), and the US Canola Association. She is also a past member of the Perrydale School Board, Polk County Farm Bureau, Oregon 4H Board of Trustees, and past President of the Willamette Valley Oilseed Producers Association.

Anna is married to Jason and has two children - Robby, who graduated this year from Western Oregon University will be working at Wells High School in Portland and continuing to work on the Wells varsity football staff.  Megan, who graduated from Amity High School this year, is attending Eastern Oregon University and studying Ag Entrepreneurship and Economics.

Anna has been serving as the State Representative from HD 23 since 2021.
