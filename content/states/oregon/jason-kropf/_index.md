Jason Kropf represents House District 54 in the Oregon State Legislature. Elected in November 2020, Jason is currently in his second term of office. During his time as a legislator, he has worked on a range of policy issues, helping to promote affordable housing production, respond to the climate crisis, invest in child care and education, foster safer communities and more.​

Jason brings more than two decades of experience as a lawyer to the Capitol. Early in his career, he served as a public defender, working in both Portland and Bend. Prior to joining the Legislature, Jason worked as a Deputy District Attorney for Deschutes County. In June 2022, he was appointed Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, a role that builds on his experience with the justice system.


Jason’s commitment to the community follows him beyond his work as an attorney and legislator. He has served on the Board of Directors for the Bend Parks and Recreation District, Board of Directors for the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) of Central Oregon and on the City of Bend’s Accessibility Advisory Committee.


Jason and his family live in Bend, Oregon, where they enjoy exploring the great outdoors. Raised in a military and union family, Jason is the fourth generation of his family to call Oregon home. He is a proud product of Oregon public schools, graduating from Molalla Union High School, Oregon State University and the University of Oregon School of Law.​
