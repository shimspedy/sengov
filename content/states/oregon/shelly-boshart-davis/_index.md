Shelly Boshart Davis is rooted in Linn County and Oregon’s agriculture community. She grew up on a family farm in the Tangent and Shedd area. She attended Oregon State University where she earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration.

She has spent the last twelve years alongside her parents and siblings, helping grow the family farm and trucking business. Today, the farm has a global reach, shipping Oregon agricultural products to farmers as far as Japan and South Korea.

Shelly advocates for her community and industry as an active volunteer. She serves on the Government Affairs Committee for the Albany Chamber of Commerce, and previously sat on the local United Way board. In 2016, she was appointed to the Linn County Budget Committee.

She is involved with the Linn County Farm Bureau, Oregon Women for Agriculture, Oregon Trucking Association, and Oregon Seed Council. Nationally, she has served as president for the U.S. Forage Export Council, and she sits on the advisory committee for the Agriculture Transportation Coalition.

Shelly is passionate about agricultural education, sitting on the board for the nonprofit association, Oregon Aglink, and volunteering with three local schools through the Adopt-A-Farmer program.

Shelly and her husband, Geoff, have three daughters who are active in 4-H and FFA. They prefer to spend as much time as possible in the barn taking care of their animals, including raising hogs to show at the Linn County Fair.
