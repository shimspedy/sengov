David Gomberg is now in his sixth term representing House District 10 in the Oregon Legislature. The district stretches from Lincoln City to Junction City and from Florence to Philomath covering Lincoln County and portions of Western Lane and Benton Counties.

Representative Gomberg serves as co-vice chair of the full Ways and Means budgeting committee and co-chair of the subcommittee on Transportation and Economic Development. He is a member of the Emergency Board, the Governor’s Commission on Senior Services, the Oregon Innovation Council, the Seismic Safety Commission, and the Ocean Science Trust.

His most recent legislative efforts have focused on infrastructure investments, wildfire recovery, and emergency response. He reversed the Governor’s cuts to veteran programs. He doubled funding for the Small Business Development Network. He helped reduce the cost of prescription drugs. He led bipartisan efforts to support rural economic development. And in the past two years, Gomberg brought home funding for ports, parks, water systems, and fire stations across the district totaling over $70 million.

For more than 35 years, Representative Gomberg owned and operated a small business. He describes himself as a professional kite flier. His company designed and manufactured kites, produced large show kites, and operated web pages and retail stores. He has performed for Walt Disney, the Super Bowl, the London Millennium Celebration, and in 40 different countries. In 2005, he was inducted into the Kite Hall of Fame.
