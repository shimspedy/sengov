Rep. McLain is a 5th generation Oregonian, raised on farms in the Willamette Valley. When she was young, Susan got involved in 4-H and raised sheep, swine, and beef cattle with her brothers and sisters.
A graduate of Western Oregon University (formerly O.C.E), Susan spent over 40 years teaching and coaching speech and debate in Hillsboro. In 2011, she was honored to receive a Crystal Apple award for outstanding local teachers from the Hillsboro Chamber of Commerce. Susan recently received a national award for longevity and excellence as Glencoe High School’s Speech and Debate coach.

Susan raised her family in Forest Grove, where she still lives today. The unique balance between her rural upbringing and her family’s proximity to a metropolitan area was the reason she decided to run for a position as Metro Regional Government Councilor in 1990. Susan was elected to serve on the Metro Council four terms in a row.

Susan has always worked to be a good listener and make sure the public has input on issues of land use and planning, transportation, and solid waste. It was – and always will be – important to her to make sure that she is helping facilitate a government that is transparent, accountable, and responsive to the needs of Oregon voters.
