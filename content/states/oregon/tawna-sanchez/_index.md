Tawna Dee Sanchez was born on August 23, 1961. She is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Oregon House of Representatives. She represents the 43rd district, which covers parts of north-central Portland.

Sanchez was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. She claims Shoshone, Bannock, and Ute descent and was the second Native American elected to serve in the Oregon legislature (following Jackie Taylor) and the first to represent Portland. Sanchez graduated with a bachelor's degree from Marylhurst University and with a master's degree from Portland State University.

She has worked with the Native American Youth and Family Center for much of her life. Sanchez has served on the Oregon Child Welfare Advisory Commission and the Oregon Family Services Review Commission. She won election to the House in 2016, narrowly defeating Roberta Phillip-Robbins in the Democratic primary and running unopposed in the general election.

As of 2023, Sanchez is the co-chair of the Oregon legislature's joint Ways and Means committee, along with Senator Elizabeth Steiner. She has been a leader fighting for the rights of women, indigenous people, and the most vulnerable. As the Director of Family Services at the Native American Youth and Family Center (NAYA), Tawna helped create the Early College Academy, expanded early childhood services, affordable housing development, elder support, and assisted in building a nationally recognized domestic violence wrap-around service model.

Over time, Tawna has helped raise 18 foster kids, and has been active in state policy making â€“ serving on the Family Services Review Commission and the Child Welfare Advisory Committee. As a state representative, Tawna remains committed to standing up for social justice on the side of the oppressed, and pushing to make our systems more equitable.
