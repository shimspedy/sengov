Cedric is a dentist, business owner, and an Oregon State Senator for District 6.  Now completing his second session as State Representative, Cedric serves as the Vice-Chair for the House Committee for Health Care and is also a member of both the House Early Childhood and Family Supports; and Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Services.

Cedric Hayden grew up in rural Fall Creek, Oregon, a member of what is now a sixth generation Covered Wagon pioneer family. In fact, his great-grandmother was the first female mayor of Burns, Oregon. Long before he was born, his father and mother had dedicated themselves to full time oral public health services in a number of third world countries.  When he was born in 1968, he and his brothers were immersed in the lifestyle of public service.  

In 1994, he graduated from the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry after attending undergraduate school in Walla Walla, Washington and joined the family dental practice.  He resides in Fall Creek, Oregon with his wife Julie and their five children. In his spare time he enjoys being at home with his family and taking care of his horses. Cedric has on several occasions been honored as an outstanding quarter horse breeder.

In 1994-2009 Cedric created Oregon's first statewide oral health network, together with his brothers providing dental service in 35 out of the 36 Oregon counties.
An outdoorsman, in 2001-2007 Cedric completed the worlds "Seven Summits" and "Grand Slam", by summiting the highest mountain on each of the seven continents, and skiing to the North and South Poles.
In 2007-Cedric founded Caring Hands Worldwide, an international public health charity for the uninsured and poverty stricken.
Cedric and his wife Julie began this dental charity in late 2007 as a safety net for children and adults that don't have insurance or the ability to visit a dentist. Their efforts have expanded to running pro bono mobile dental clinics in rural Oregon, as well as Micronesia in the South Pacific, Zambia, Africa, and Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.  

When not occupied with Legislative duties, Cedric is a businessman operating several businesses, including a charter air service based in Creswell, Oregon, a horse and cattle ranch in Fall Creek, and a heavy equipment business specializing in combating wildland fire, and has a hospital based dental practice treating special needs dental patients.

The geography of Senate District 6 is diverse, spanning much of Eastern Lane and Douglas Counties, including the incorporated towns of Drain, West fir, Oakland, Oakridge, Cottage Grove, Yoncalla, Elkton, Sutherlin, Lowell, and parts of Roseburg, as well as many built up unincorporated areas.  It is a beautiful rural area with magnificent scenery, waterfalls, lakes and covered bridges that Cedric feels fortunate to represent.
