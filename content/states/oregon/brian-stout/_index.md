Stout was the 2020 Republican nominee to represent the 31st district in the Oregon House of Representatives. He lost the general election to incumbent Brad Witt by 511 votes. Stout ran for the same seat in 2022, defeating the Democratic nominee, Anthony Sorace. Stout was sworn in on January 9, 2023. He served on the Committee on Business and Labor and the Committee on Economic Development and Small Businesses.

On November 7, 2022, a Columbia County Circuit Court judge granted a five-year protective order against Brian Stout when a woman filed a petition alleging sexual abuse. On January 16, 2023, Stout was removed from his committee assignments. On April 28, 2023, after a three-day hearing, the Columbia County Circuit Court judge ruled against Stout's request to dismiss the restraining order. On May 9, 2023, House Speaker Dan Rayfield called on Stout to resign. On February 8, 2024, Stout announced that he would not be running for re-election.
