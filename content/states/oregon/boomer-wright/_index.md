Representative Boomer (Duane) Wright currently lives in Reedsport, Oregon with his wife Susan, dog named Wynston and cat named Marvin. Boomer and Susan have been married for 27 years.

Representative Wright was born the only child of Hollie and Loretta Wright. Boomer grew up in Lorane, Oregon after moving from California at 10 years of age.  After graduatiâ€‹ng from Crow High School, Boomer received his Bachelor's Degree in Education from Oregon College of Education in 1972. While in college, he met his first wife Andrea, who pasted away in 1991. He and Andrea moved to Florence, Oregon in 1972, when starting his first teaching job at Siuslaw Elementary. He and Andrea had two children, Kelli and Byron. While the children were young, Boomer finished his Master's Degree in Education and Certification as an Administrator in 1982 from the University of Oregon. Boomer was Vice Principal for Siuslaw Middle School for the school year 1981-1982; Principal for Rhododendron Elementary 1982-1988; Principal for Siuslaw Middle School 1988-1994; Principal of Siuslaw Primary 1994-1999; Superintendent of Mapleton School District from 1999-2002.

Boomer then accepted a job as General Manager of Sea Lion Caves for 5 years. Since his retirement from the Caves, he has substitute taught at various local high schools of House District 9. He enjoys being with the students and learning as much from them as they learn from him.
