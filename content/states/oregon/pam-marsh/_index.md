Pam Marsh was first elected to House District 5 in Southern Oregon in November 2016. Pam is currently serving as Chair of the House Committee on Energy and Environment and as a member of the House Committee on Agriculture and Natural Resources and House Committee on Revenue.

In the 2017 and 2018 Legislative Sessions, she served as Vice-Chair of the House Committee on Economic Development and Trade, and as a member of the House Revenue Committee, the Joint Committee on Tax Credits, the Joint Ways and Means Subcommittee on General Government, and the House Energy and Environment Committee.

Prior to joining the Oregon Legislature, Pam served the City of Ashland as a City Councilor for four years, and as a member and chair of the city Planning Commission and a member of the Ashland Charter Review Committee.

From 2006-2012 Pam worked as Deputy Director of a local nonprofit providing drug and alcohol prevention and treatment.  She served as Executive Director of Ashland Emergency Food Bank from 2012 until December 2016.

Pam has lived in Southern Oregon since 1994, when she and her husband, Diarmuid McGuire, moved their four children from Palo Alto, California, to the mountains above Ashland.  In Palo Alto, Pam worked for a state legislator, managed a cities association, and served in a variety of governmental and nonprofit volunteer positions.

For a decade Pam was actively involved in management and operation of Green Springs Inn and Cabins. Her family continues to own the business, now managed by her husband and son.

Pam ran for the Legislature because she knows from firsthand experience that government matters. Thoughtful, targeted and leveraged policies are necessary to protect our most vulnerable residents, lift our families, and assist residents as they create healthy, self-sustaining communities.
