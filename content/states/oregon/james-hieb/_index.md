James Hieb is an American politician who is a member of the Oregon House of Representatives for the 51st district. He was sworn into office on February 8th as the replacement for former House Representative Christine Drazan (R-Canby).

Hieb is a husband and father, with all aspects of his life revolving around this absolute. He has structured his life in a way that his family is always a priority. For work, he is the Director at Building Blocks Early Learning Center where he cares for over a hundred children a day. He employs around twenty full-time employees, at any one time, between their two facilities. He is also business partners with his mother and his wife, who support him in his desire to serve as a Representative of their community.

His desire to serve is not new. His service to their community began at the age of seventeen when he swore an oath to their nation and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He subsequently deployed to Fallujah Iraq, as an infantryman, on two separate combat tours. He fought in the largest battle since the Tet Offensive in Vietnam, known as Operation Phantom Fury, serving under both General Mattis and General Kelly.

After receiving an Honorable Discharge, he moved back home to Clackamas County, where he has been a legal resident for his entire life. It was 2008, his wife and he had their first child, and his job constructing homes ended, he used this opportunity to attend college part-time, while working for Building Blocks and Hoffman Family Farms.

In 2014 his father passed away and he began to work with his mom full time at Building Blocks ELC, while it was still an in-home preschool and childcare. They decided that it was time to expand and settled on a commercial building to lease. Since then, they have grown their program from sixteen children to over one hundred twenty kids. Over this time period, his role has taken many forms. He does everything from work in the classroom, address parents' concerns, set policy, work with the State and ESD providing services for children, securing business capital, permitting, incorporation and forecasting for the future.

He is currently on the Canby Housing Needs Committee, Vice Chair of the Canby Planning Commission, on his second term. He is the Vice Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars post #6057, where heâ€™s also served as a Trustee and Adjutant. He is active with the American Legion post 122, where he is a regular volunteer. He has served the community in many capacities and looks forward to the opportunity to serve them as a House Representative.
