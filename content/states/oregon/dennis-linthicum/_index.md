Dennis Linthicum is an American politician serving in the Oregon Senate. He is a member of the Republican Party and has been serving in the senate since 2017.

Born in 1956 in California, Linthicum graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1978. He furthered his education by receiving a master's degree in Christian Apologetics from Biola University in 2009.

Linthicum began his career as a software developer in California, working for Hughes Aircraft. He later served as the senior vice president of management information systems at Lange Financial and again at Pacific Mutual Life Insurance.

In 2008, Linthicum was elected as a Klamath County Commissioner. During his tenure, he was involved in a recall petition to remove all of the commissioners over funding issues. However, the recall backers did not gather enough signatures on petitions to qualify the issue for the ballot.

In 2016, Linthicum ran as a conservative insurgent for the 2nd U.S. Congressional District seat held by U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, R-Hood River. Despite losing the primary vote to Walden, Linthicum won election to the Oregon Senate in 2014.

During the 2019 legislative session, Linthicum was among 11 Republican state senators who walked out to deny the Democratic-majority Senate the minimum of 20 senators required to establish a quorum to do any business. The walkout's aim was to prevent a vote on a cap-and-trade bill that supporters said would lower greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to combat climate change.

Linthicum was re-elected to a second four-year term in November 2020. On December 11, 2020, Linthicum and 11 other state Republican officials signed a letter requesting Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum join Texas and other states contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election in Texas v. Pennsylvania.
