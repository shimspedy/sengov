Hoa H. Nguyen is an American politician serving as a member of the Oregon House of Representatives for the 48th district. She was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 9, 2023.

Born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, Hoa is the daughter of Vietnamese immigrants. At the age of 15, she relocated to Portland, Oregon, where she graduated from St. Mary's Academy in 2003. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology from Portland State University in 2008.

Hoa has a rich career history in education and community service. From 2008 to 2010, she worked as an extended day coordinator for the Metropolitan Family Service and Neighborhood House. She later worked as a school attendance case manager and school program manager for Neighborhood House. From 2015 to 2022, she served as a school attendance coach for Portland Public Schools. In August 2022, she joined the Clackamas Education Service District as a student and community engagement specialist.

In addition to her professional career, Hoa has been the Director on the David Douglas School Board. As the daughter of Vietnamese refugees and an educator, she understands the disparities many families are facing. She also knows the power of strong communities working together to solve our toughest problems.

As a representative, Hoa works for all families to have the opportunity to thrive. She fights to fund our schools, increase access to childcare, and invest in robust workforce programs. She advocates for equitable affordable housing solutions that match our district's unique make-up of urban and rural communities. North Clackamas and East Portland are among the fastest growing areas of Oregon. Hoa champions policies that reduce disparities while fostering healthy and vibrant neighborhoods. She listens to the concerns of her constituents and is their voice at the Capitol.

Former State Representative Jeff Reardon, HD 48, has expressed confidence in Hoa's ability to understand and advocate for the needs of the community. As a bilingual, bicultural educator, Hoa brings a perspective that is missing and is greatly needed in Salem.
