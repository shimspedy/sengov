Zach is a father, husband, educator, and lifelong Oregonian. He grew up in Ashland and attended Ashland High School, then earned a bachelor's and master's degree from the University of Winchester in England, and subsequently earned a Master of Education degree from Portland State University.

Beginning in 2004, Zach began his teaching career in and around House District 49, variously teaching language arts, math, and special education at Gresham High School, Corbett High School, Reynolds High School, and Mt. Hood Community College.

Zach served as a City Councilor in Troutdale from 2017 to 2020. Prior to his election, he was a member of the Troutdale Citizens' Advisory Committee and the Troutdale Budget Committee, and he's also helped organize Troutdale's annual Summerfest. When Covid restrictions ease, he looks forward to returning to volunteer work with his daughter at the Multnomah County Animal Shelter in Troutdale.
