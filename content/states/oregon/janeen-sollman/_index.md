Janeen A. Sollman is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Oregon State Senate from the 15th district. She has been a resident of Senate District 15 for 29 years and has raised her family there. She has two grown sons, Jordan and Matthew, and has been married to her husband, Tony, for 31 years.

Before her tenure in the Senate, she served as a member of the Oregon House of Representatives from 2017 to 2022. She was elected in 2016 as the House District 30 Representative. Prior to that, she served on the Hillsboro School Board from 2009 until 2017 and was the board chair from 2011 until 2013.

In her professional life, she works for Vernier Software & Technology, a Washington County educational technology company that provides opportunities for STEM education across the state and internationally. She has been at Vernier for 25 years and loves the work she does.

In addition to her political and professional roles, Sollman is also involved in civic engagement. She has been a Meals on Wheels volunteer for over 10 years, delivering meals and calling homebound seniors each week to do well-check visits. She also serves on the Advisory Board of the local Hillsboro Center.

Throughout her career, Sollman has been a proponent for career exposure at a young age. Her two sons took different pathways through their education, one through the university system to become a special education teacher, and the other through the trade pathway now has a very strong career, with room to grow. She believes that both occupations are great careers, and that the state must do everything it can to promote students finding their path and encouraging them to pursue it.

Sollman prides herself on being accessible and encourages others to get involved in the legislative process. She is dedicated to serving her community and is proud to represent Senate District 15.
