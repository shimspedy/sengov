Chris Gorsek, born on January 28, 1958, in Portland, Oregon, is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Oregon State Senate. He has been representing District 25 since January 11, 2021.

Gorsek earned his Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts from the University of Oregon, followed by a PhD from Portland State University. His academic pursuits laid a strong foundation for his future career in public service.

Before his political career, Gorsek served as a police officer with the Portland Police Bureau, patrolling neighborhoods on the east side of Portland. His experience in law enforcement provided him with valuable insights into the community he would later represent.

In addition to his law enforcement career, Gorsek is an educator. He has been teaching geography and law enforcement at Mount Hood Community College since 1996. His role as an educator allows him to directly impact the lives of students and shape future generations.

Gorsek's political career has been marked by several significant elections. In 2012, he challenged incumbent Republican Representative Matt Wand for the District 49 seat. Gorsek was unopposed for the Democratic Primary, winning with a significant number of votes. He went on to win the General election against Representative Wand.

In 2000, Gorsek ran for the Senate District 11 seat, which was left open due to term limits. Although he was unopposed for the Democratic Primary, he lost the General election to Republican nominee John Minnis.

Throughout his political career, Gorsek has used his diverse experiences to improve, reform, and strengthen his communities and district. His work as a senator is driven by his roles as an educator, a father, a grandfather, and a former police officer.

Gorsek currently resides in Gresham with his wife Jackie and their family, after living in Troutdale for 20 years.
