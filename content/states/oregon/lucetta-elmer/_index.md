Lucetta Elmer is an American politician and businesswoman serving as a member of the Oregon House of Representatives for the 24th district. She was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on January 9, 2023.

Born and raised in McMinnville, Oregon, Lucetta is an Oregon native. She grew up on a small farm in Yamhill County just between Willamina and Sheridan. It was there on the farm that her earnest work ethic was formed. She tends not to shy away from hard labor or difficult tasks.

Lucetta had her first taste of small business experience when she was 15 and began to do payroll for her dad's timber business. After high school, she went on to earn her Bachelor of Science in Education from Linfield University. It wasn't long before she started her own school, marrying her two passions: business and education.

She married her high school sweetheart, Denny Elmer, and they began a lifelong journey of small business development and community involvement. In their 30 years of marriage, they have had four beautiful children. Each of them has a passion for entrepreneurship, and they are all now actively pursuing their own entrepreneurial dreams.

Lucetta wants her legislative work to be approached not only with her constituents in mind, but also the next generation of Oregonians and entrepreneurs. When not working on various business opportunities, she has held a seat on numerous civic committees, from the McMinnville Chamber of Commerce to the McMinnville Downtown Association.

In addition to her political career, Lucetta is the owner and managing partner of Douglas on Third, a boutique hotel. She also owns and operates Union Block Coffee. She looks forward to this new endeavor of public service, and is always wanting to learn how she can best serve her constituents in this process.
