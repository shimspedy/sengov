Virgle Osborne is currently serving his first term as State Representative to the voters of House District 2 which includes the communities of Roseburg, Sutherlin, Glide, Elkton, Drain, Yoncalla, and many others; and houses much of the beautiful Umpqua National Forest. Virgle has deep southern Oregon roots, growing up in a small town in Douglas County. He has dedicated many years of his life to public service, first serving on the Winston Planning Commission in the early 2000s. He also served on the Douglas County Planning Commission and was voted into the Oregon State Parks and Recreation Department’s OHV Oversight Committee and Sub-Grant Committee.

Virgle volunteers for the Douglas County Sheriff’s Department Search and Rescue Team and has served as Chairman of the Douglas County Search and Rescue non-profit. In 2019, Virgle created Champagne Creek Ranch, a non-profit that serves our first responders as well as kids and adults who are physically unable to get out and enjoy the outdoors by creating an easily accessible outdoor experience.

Outside of public service, Virgle owns and operates a small business that was established in 2014. He also works as a Senior Account Manager at a long-standing business in Roseburg.
