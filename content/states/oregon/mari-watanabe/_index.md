Mari Watanabe, a member of the Democratic Party, serves in the Oregon House of Representatives, representing District 34. She assumed office on January 19, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 11, 2027.

Mari Watanabe's journey to public service is marked by her dedication to diversity and community engagement. Before her appointment to the Oregon House of Representatives, she served as the executive director of Partners in Diversity, a Portland-based organization, from 2010 to 2023. Her leadership in this role focused on fostering inclusivity and equity within workplaces across Oregon. Additionally, she was the first executive director of the Japanese American Museum of Oregon, beginning her tenure there in 2008. Her work at the museum highlighted her commitment to preserving and celebrating cultural heritage.

Watanabe's appointment to the Oregon House of Representatives was a historic moment, as she became the first female Japanese American to serve in this capacity. Her appointment was made by the Multnomah County and Washington County Boards of Commissioners on January 15, 2025, following the vacancy left by Lisa Reynolds. This milestone reflects her trailblazing spirit and the trust placed in her by her community.

In addition to her legislative role, Watanabe is also a member of the Portland Community College Board of Directors, representing Zone 4. She assumed this position on October 23, 2023, and her term will conclude on June 30, 2025. Her involvement in education governance underscores her commitment to empowering individuals through learning and development.

Mari Watanabe's career is a testament to her unwavering dedication to public service, cultural preservation, and community empowerment. Her leadership continues to inspire and pave the way for future generations in Oregon and beyond.
