Eric Werner Reschke (born 1965) is an American businessman and Republican politician currently serving in the Oregon House of Representatives. He represents the 55th district, which covers parts of Jackson and Klamath counties, including parts of Klamath Falls.

Reschke was born in Los Angeles, California in 1965, grew up in Beaverton, Oregon, and graduated from Sunset High School in 1983. He graduated from Oregon State University in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Business Administration. After graduation, he worked for Georgia-Pacific, Tektronix, and Xerox in the Portland metropolitan area before moving to Klamath County in 2001.

Reschke was a board member of the Klamath County Chamber of Commerce from 2012 until 2016 and was elected to the Oregon State House in 2016. In the election, he earned 48.77% of the vote, defeating Democratic candidate Al Switzer and non-affiliated candidate Jonah Hakanson. In 2018, Reschke was reelected earning 71.8% of the vote over Democratic challenger Taylor Tupper. In 2020, Reschke was re-elected earning 71.7% of the vote over Democratic challenger Faith Leith.

On December 11, 2020, Reschke and 11 other state Republican officials signed a letter requesting Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum join Texas and other states contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election in Texas v. Pennsylvania. Rosenblum announced she had filed in behalf of the defense, and against Texas, the day prior.

On a January 17, 2024 National Association of Christian Lawmakers livestream with host Jason Rapert, Reschke said Christians "are the types of people you want in government making tough decisions at tough times. You don’t want a materialist. You don’t want an atheist. You don’t want a Muslim… You want somebody who understands what truth is, and understands the nature of man, the nature of government and the nature of God." He went on to say "we have a lot of people who are godless, unfortunately, leading the way, and it’s the blind leading the blind". The Freedom From Religion Foundation objected to his comments in a letter from Annie Laurie Gaylor. The People for the American Way's Right Wing Watch objected to his comments, as did Kayse Jama, a fellow member of the Oregon legislature who is Muslim.

Reschke is married and has one son. The family attends Calvary Chapel Church in Klamath Falls.
