WLnsvey (wins-vay) Campos represents Oregon Senate District 18 which includes Aloha, South Hillsboro, and Beaverton. Wlnsvey was raised in Bandon, Oregon by a single father in a low-income household. As the proud daughter of immigrants, she was confronted as a child with the disparity between those who were afforded opportunities and those who were not, regardless of how hard they worked. Senator Campos previously represented Oregon House District 28. When she first assumed office on January 11, 2021, she became the youngest woman ever elected to the Oregon House of Representatives. In 2022, she was elected to the Oregon State Senate, becoming the youngest State Senator in Oregon history. In addition to her position as a legislator, she has formerly worked as a housing case manager and currently works to support school-based health systems in her second job.

Senator Campos has championed progressive policies that center the most vulnerable Oregonians. She has worked to expand access to healthcare, address food insecurity, and tackle issues tied to housing instability. As the former Vice Chair of the House Housing Committee, she has helped to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in financial assistance to landlords, tenants, and community organizers to address the Stateâ€™s housing crisis. As the current co-chair of the Ways and Means Human Services subcommittee, she has prioritized investments in behavioral health, community-based care services, and early childhood resources.
