Diane Linthicum is a Republican member of the Oregon State Senate, representing District 28. She assumed office on January 13, 2025, and her current term is set to end on January 8, 2029.

Diane Linthicum's journey into politics is deeply intertwined with her personal and professional life. Before her tenure in the Senate, she served as the legislative chief of staff for her husband, Dennis Linthicum, who previously held the same Senate seat. Her experience in this role provided her with a comprehensive understanding of legislative processes and constituent engagement. Diane's decision to run for office came after her husband was deemed ineligible for re-election due to his participation in the 2023 Oregon Senate walkout, which led to the passage of Measure 113.

Diane's educational background includes studies in business at Orange Coast College and Rio Hondo College, both located in California. Her professional career spans various roles, including serving as an office manager and CFO for Aslan Enterprises and owning Burning Daylight Foods. Additionally, Diane and her husband own a ranch, reflecting their deep connection to the rural communities they represent.

In the 2024 elections, Diane Linthicum emerged victorious in both the Republican primary and the general election. She defeated Klamath County Commissioner Dave Henslee in the primary and Democratic candidate Dylan Gutridge in the general election, securing a significant majority. Her campaign emphasized her commitment to representing the interests of District 28, which encompasses Klamath County and parts of Deschutes and Jackson Counties.

As a state senator, Diane has been appointed vice-chair of the Human Services Committee and serves on the Health Care Committee and the Committee on Early Childhood and Behavioral Health. These roles align with her dedication to addressing critical issues affecting her constituents, including healthcare access, early childhood development, and behavioral health services.

Diane Linthicum's personal life is rooted in her community. She and her husband, Dennis, reside in Beatty, Oregon, and are proud parents of two children. Her deep ties to the region and her diverse professional experiences have shaped her approach to governance, making her a dedicated advocate for the people of District 28.
