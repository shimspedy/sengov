In 2022, Ceci Maher was elected to represent the 26th state Senate district which covers parts of Weston, Wilton, Westport, Ridgefield, Redding, Darien, New Canaan and Stamford. This will be the senator's first term in the state Senate.

Ceci enjoyed a successful career in the retail space, running a multi-million-dollar department. â€¯While taking time off to raise her children she volunteered for organizations in the community. Based on lessons learned while volunteering, she pursued a master's degree in social work, graduating from Columbia University.

As a licensed master social worker, Ceci worked with children and youth in a psychiatric hospital, and then moved to leading local nonprofits. Ceci led the growth of educational opportunity programs at the Horizons National Student Enrichment Program for five years, and while executive director of Person-to-Person, she grew the agency from serving 15,000 people to serving 25,000 people per year and ultimately providing food for more than 2 million meals per year to people in need in 7 of the towns of lower Fairfield County.

Ceci led Sandy Hook Promise as interim executive director, supporting gun violence prevention programs, including the important "Know the Signs" program helping to create safer communities for students and families.

Currently Ceci resides in Wilton, where their children attended public schools. She grew up in Stamford, started their family in Norwalk, has worked in New Canaan and Darien, and volunteered in Westport.
