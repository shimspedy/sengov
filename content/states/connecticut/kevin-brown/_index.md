State Representative Kevin Brown was born and raised in Norwich, CT. He is the proud son of a Marine Veteran dad and a working mom. Having received an education through the public school system, including graduating from Eastern Connecticut State University, Kevin understands that education provides the key to our country’s future. Kevin and his wife Christina, a school administrator, moved to the Vernon-Rockville community to start their family. Vernon quickly became home. Kevin and Christina’s children, twelve-year-old Jacob and eight-year-old Emilie, attend Vernon Public Schools and participate in a variety of activities and sports through Vernon Parks and Rec, school, and other wonderful town organizations. Kevin has had the joy and honor of coaching many of his children’s sports teams, getting to know many other Vernon-Rockville families in the process.

With five years of experience on the Vernon Board of Education, Kevin has worked on numerous committees. Working across the aisle with BOE members on the Finance Committee, Curriculum Committee, and Policy Committee, among others, he has worked to deliver responsible and balanced budgets, while placing an emphasis on equity for all Vernon students. Kevin’s 17 years teaching civics and coaching youth sports has given him an understanding and appreciation of the value of giving back to the community. Kevin has spent his career teaching high school students, future leaders, the skills necessary to be civically engaged members of their communities.

Rep. Brown was first elected in 2022. He currently serves on the Education, Housing and Internship committees.
