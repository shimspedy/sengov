Derek Slap, born around 1974, is an American politician, journalist, and businessman. He is a member of the Democratic Party and has been serving as a member of the Connecticut State Senate from the 5th district since March 1, 2019. Prior to this, he was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from 2017 to 2019, serving District 19.

Slap earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism and international relations at Syracuse University, followed by a master's of business administration at the University of Connecticut School of Business. Between 1998 and 2003, he was a news anchor and reporter at WVIT. He then served as a chief of staff for Democratic Party-affiliated members of the Connecticut Senate, as well as communications director for John DeStefano Jr. In 2014, Slap joined the UConn Foundation as vice president of external relations.

In May 2016, Slap was nominated by the Democratic Party as its candidate for Connecticut House of Representatives District 19, after sitting legislator Brian Becker announced his retirement. Slap faced Republican Party candidate Chris Barnes in the general election. Slap retained his seat in the state house in November 2018, running unopposed.

Following Beth Bye's appointment to Ned Lamont's gubernatorial administration, Slap ran for her District 5 seat in the Connecticut Senate. Slap faced Bill Wadsworth, Jeffrey Przech, and Mark Stewart Greenstein in the special election. Slap was sworn in as a state senator on March 1, 2019. Within the Connecticut Senate, Slap became the deputy majority leader. The Democratic Party endorsed Slap's 2020 bid for re-election to the state senate. Slap defeated Republican Challenger Phillip Chabot in the general election on November 3, 2020.
