Lucy Dathan is the State Representative for the 142nd District in New Canaan/Norwalk serving her constituents since 2019. She was born and raised in St Louis, Missouri and went to an all-girls school from grade school through high school. She then went to Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California where she majored in Accounting and Business.

She values her education as it greatly contributed to her success and professional career, which has spanned over 28 years, working within finance and across many commercial sectors all over the world.

During her tenure, Dathan has served as Vice Chair of the legislature's Appropriations Committee, and as a member of the Human Services and the Insurance & Real Estate Committees.

For her new legislative term in 2023, Lucy has been appointed Vice Chair of the Human Services Committee and as Democratic Chair and Leader of the bipartisan Regulations Review Committee. Additionally, she will continue to serve on the Appropriations Committee.

Lucy began her career as an auditor in a Big 4 firm in San Jose, California where she focused on venture capital firms and ventured backed technology startup companies. There she qualified as a Certified Public Accountant. She moved to Poland and worked with the financial sector as the country was opening to western markets. She then went to London and worked over 10 years broadening her experience in investment banking, raising finance and as a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in two Venture backed firms. In London, she also worked for the London Stock Exchange in the legal department where she managed the intellectual capital of the firm.

Since moving back to the United States 15 years ago, she has continued to work part-time while raising a family as a CFO in various technology companies, building finance functions from the ground up, creating budgets and strategic forecasts, overseeing funding rounds, and mergers & acquisitions activities.

She moved with her husband and three children aged 18, 16 and 14 to the Town of New Canaan in February 2015 from Palo Alto, California, where she had lived for 9 years. Lucy continues to help technology startups on a part time basis as a contract finance executive.
