First elected in 2018, Anthony Nolan is in his third term as State Representative serving New London’s 39th district. He is Chair of the legislature's Veterans and Military Affairs Committee and a member of the Appropriations and Internship Committees

Speaker of the House Matt Ritter appointed Nolan to the state's Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee. Ritter cited Nolan's law enforcement background and support and advocacy of legislation targeting racism and social justice.

Nolan has spent his entire life in public service. He served with the U.S. Navy and retired in April 2023 after 23 years as a New London Police Officer. He was a four-term member of the New London City Council and served as Council President during a difficult time. Nolan is a deacon at Shiloh Baptist Church and an advocate for many youth programs in the city.

Youth advocacy is a priority for Nolan who represented children’s interests on the Board of Education. He has also volunteered in countless programs including the New London Youth Collaborative and the city Youth Talent Show.

Nolan was awarded the NAACP Freedom Fund Award, NAACP Danny Jenkins Memorial Award, the Rotary Club of New London Unsung Hero Award, and the National Council of Negro Woman (NCNCW) - Bethune Legacy Award.
