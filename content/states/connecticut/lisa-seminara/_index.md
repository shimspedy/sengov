Lisa Seminara was elected to serve the 8th Senate District in 2022. The 8th District includes the towns of Avon, Barkhamsted, Canton, Colebrook, Granby, Hartland, Harwinton, New Hartford, Norfolk, Simsbury and Torrington.

Lisa has served as elected member of the Avon Board of Education, she is a licensed clinical social worker, and is a dedicated community servant.

Lisa was the first in her family to earn a college degree, graduating with honors from St. John’s University and later earning a master’s degree in social work from Columbia University.

Lisa and her husband of 28 years, Nick, have three children—Martina, 23, a recent graduate of Trinity College;  Madelyn, 20, a third-year business major at Clemson University; and Nicholas, 16, a junior multi-sport athlete at Avon High School.

When Martina was born with Cerebral Palsy, the mission to become her advocate deepened Lisa’s passion for fair education and opportunity for all. Lisa founded the Avon Special Education Parent Association, became active in the community, and created a non-profit that funded and developed a large parcel of land into a handicap accessible playground that they donated to the town of Avon.
