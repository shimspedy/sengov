State Representative Steve Weir represents the 55th District, serving the towns of Andover, Bolton, Glastonbury, Hebron and Marlborough in the Connecticut General Assembly. In his first term in office, Rep. Weir serves on the legislatures Labor, Higher Education, and Housing Committees.

Having spent the early part of his life in Glastonbury, Steve and his wife Allegra moved to Hebron in 2000 and have called it home ever since. There they’ve raised three daughters: Alexia, Julianna & Meredith.

Prior to being elected in November of 2022, Steve’s community involvement in the 55th District runs deep. He was the Founder of American Integrity Restoration (Now BluSky Restoration Contractors), immediate past president of the UConn Club Board of Directors, and former chair of the Gilead Congregational Church Board of Trustees.

Steve currently serves as an elected member of the Hebron Zoning Board of Appeals, Chairman of the CT River Valley Chamber of Commerce, and board member of the Connecticut Apartment Association.

He is also a volunteer and advocate for local charities including a mission to Virginia with the Appalachian Service Project.  Steve & Allegra support their daughter Alexia’s work with a dog rescue by having provided shelter to over 100 dogs in the past 2+ years.  A few of the dogs have been “failed fosters” and have taken up permanent residence with the Weir family.

Representative Weir is a staunch supporter of equal protection under law, public safety, free markets, limiting government intrusion and protecting individual & property rights. With a 100% voting record in his first term and attendance in his committee assignments, his commitment to those he represents and the 55th District is unquestionable.
