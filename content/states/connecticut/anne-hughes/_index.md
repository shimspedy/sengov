Representative Anne Hughes is serving her third term in the Connecticut General Assembly, proudly representing the 135th House District, which serves Easton, Weston, and Redding. Representative Hughes is an enthusiastic member of the Aging Committee, the Labor and Public Employees Committee, and the Human Services Committee. She also co-chairs the Complex Care Committee of the standing Medical Assistance Program Oversight Council (MAPOC) and has been a member of the Environmental Standards Commission on Offshore Wind since 2019.

Representative Hughes has been designated as an Environmental Champion by the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, and she is also a proud member of the Bipartisan Womenâ€™s Caucus, the Animal Advocacy Caucus, the Social Work Caucus, the Climate Caucus, the Reproductive Justice Caucus, and co-chair of the House Progressive Democratic Caucus.

Representative Hughes loves to champion systemic, equitable, effective policy change for all of Connecticut communities, including quality public education, economic justice through fair taxation and access to healthcare regardless of documentation status or gender, race, or zip code. A highly effective collaborator, she has worked with colleagues to successfully pass the Take Back Our Grid Act to force more accountability from utility companies, stronger Environmental Justice legislation to demand accountability from polluters, Paid Family Medical Leave and important bills increasing protections and relief for health care workers, safety measures for elders from abuse and fraud, and gun safety protections like safe storage and domestic violence protections. Representative Hughes champions civic engagement of all ages wherever she goes, and raises public expectations for accountability, partnership and transparency in all levels of government.

Representative Hughes lives in Easton with her husband, Tim, and works as a Licensed Master Social Worker. She graduated Cum Laude from College of New Rochelle and earned her Master of Social Work at University of New England, and currently teaches at the Campaign Academy for Electing Social Workers.
