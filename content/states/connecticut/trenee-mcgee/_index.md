Rep. McGee served as a West Haven City Council member, where she became the youngest person to hold the position. She was the chair of the West Haven Community Alliance and co-authored West Haven's Resolution declaring racism a public health crisis.

Rep. McGee's advocacy stems from her work in socioeconomic and racial equality. In 2016, she founded Be The F.I.R.S.T.

McGee also serves as Youth Director for F.I.R.E. (Forcefully Igniting Revival Everywhere) Youth, Young Adult, and Collegiate Ministries.

Rep. McGee has a background in the arts. Her love for performance art began at a young age, where she booked several television shows and commercials. She earned a BFA in Acting from Marymount Manhattan College and a certificate in Photography & Food Studies from The Umbra Institute in Perugia, Italy.
