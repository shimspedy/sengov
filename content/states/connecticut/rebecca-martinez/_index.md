SECURE STATE FUNDS FOR PLAINVILLE, SOUTHINGTON, AND FARMINGTON
Towns throughout the state are receiving state grants to build better lives for their residents. Rebecca will work to bring state funding back to OUR district to support our youth, working families and senior citizens.

FIGHT FOR OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE
Rebecca will deliver economic relief for residents struggling with inflation by introducing legislation to further reduce taxes for seniors and the middle class, make the Child Tax Credit permanent, and take on price gouging on our daily living expenses.

SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES
Rebecca will serve as a connector to existing resources to build stronger small businesses including grants, informational resources and business development centers.

SECURE STATE FUNDS FOR PLAINVILLE, SOUTHINGTON, AND FARMINGTON
Rebecca sees the difficulties her patients face from costly healthcare. She knows how families struggle to manage care for loved ones and the elderlyâ€™s challenges to get what they need. Aware of the barriers to mental health services, she will use her 24 years of experience to bring policy changes to better support patients and caregivers.

PROTECT AND STRENGTHEN PUBLIC EDUCATION AS A BOE MEMBER
Rebecca fought for and won better schools right here in the 22nd. She knows what needs to be done to secure the highest reimbursement rate for the Plainville Middle School Renovation. As a BOE member she has always been a strong advocate for our students. In Hartford she will continue that advocacy by ensuring the district gets its fair share of state funding to reduce the burden on our towns.
