State Representative Jason Buchsbaum was elected in November 2024 to serve the 69th District and the people of Bridgewater, New Milford, Roxbury, and Southbury in the House of Representatives.

For the 2025-2026 legislative session, House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora appointed Representative Buchsbaum to serve on the Commerce Committee, the Energy and Technology Committee, and the Public Safety and Security Committee.

Before running for state office, Rep. Buchsbaum served five terms as a member of the Southbury Board of Selectmen. As a Selectman, he served as the Chairman Pro Tempore of the Board, as a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Police Services Study Committee, and as Liaison to the Emergency Medical Services Committee and Library Board. He also served as Vice Chairman of the Southbury Charter Revision Commission (2013-2014). Previously, as a resident of Seymour, he served as an elected member of the Seymour Board of Education (2007-2009).

As a public servant, Rep. Buchsbaum has always taken a results-driven, data-based approach to decision making, while also advocating for transparency, civil discourse, and collaboration in government.

Rep. Buchsbaum has prioritized fiscal responsibility through budgetary oversight, as well as support for education and local emergency services. He is a strong supporter of local police, fire, and EMS teams and was recently a key participant in Southbury’s transition to an independent police force, a public safety enhancement for the community.

Known as a consensus builder who focuses on results, his efforts have helped Southbury achieve stable taxes and fiscally sound budgets, provide improved services, and attract new business.

He has always had a passion for public service and has always looked for ways to serve his community. He looks forward to the opportunity to expand his public service in Hartford.

Rep. Buchsbaum attended the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. where he obtained a B.A., magna cum laude, in Political Science with a minor in Economics. During his time in Washington, he took full advantage of the opportunities available to him to get involved in government, working as a White House intern and as a clerk for the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary.

After college, he attended the University of Connecticut School of Law and obtained his juris doctor with high honors in 2005. During law school, he had the opportunity to work at the Capitol as part of a class in legislative process.

Following law school, Rep. Buchsbaum joined the law firm Cohen and Wolf, P.C., becoming a partner of the firm in 2013. He currently practices in the areas of litigation and municipal law, regularly representing individual, corporate and municipal clients in a variety of matters, and leads the firm’s Municipal Practice Group.

Rep. Buchsbaum is a lifelong Connecticut resident. He met his wife Lauren, now a Vice President and General Counsel to a leading educational products company, when they were first year students at UCONN Law School. They live in Southbury with their two sons, who attend Region 15 schools. The family’s weekends are spent at local youth sporting events and activities, and with family and friends.
