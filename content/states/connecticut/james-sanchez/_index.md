James B. Sánchez is serving his first term as the State Representative of the 6th Assembly House District, proudly representing the people of Hartford and Elmwood, West Hartford. James was born at the North End’s McCook Hospital and raised in the Hartford’s North End during the 1960s and 1970s. His family purchased their first home in the South End on Broadview Terrace, and his father owned and operated Sanchez Jewelry and Repair on 1339 Main Street along with various buildings on the Main Street strip in the city.

After graduation from South Catholic High School, James joined the United States Marine Corps and was enrolled in the Aviation Ordinance program. After a four-year tour throughout the U.S. and Japan, James returned to Hartford and became a coach operator for CT Transit until 1999. The following year, he started working at the Metropolitan District Commission and currently serves as a technician in the MDC’s Utilities System Monitoring and Surveillance Department.

James Sánchez served on the Hartford City Council from 2015-2023 where he helped improve safety, found solutions on budget issues, reduced urban blight, addressed environmental issues, improved equitable employment and housing, and reinforced Hartford as a destination in New England. He was also a member of the Democratic Town Committee 6th District and served as president of the Hartford Diversity Lions Club and Hartford Evening Lions club, organizations that raise money to improve the lives of the visually impaired.

Rep. Sánchez is and always has been dedicated to his constituents. He supports the residents of his community on an individual level to address their specific needs. He is committed to responding to all emails, texts, and calls for help and strives to be as responsive as possible.

Rep. Sánchez serves on the Environment, Executive and Legislative Nominations, and Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committees.

James is a proud father and grandfather. He currently lives in Hartford with his wife, Jacqueline.
