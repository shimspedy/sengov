Emmanuel "Manny" Sanchez is an American Democratic Party politician who has been serving as a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from the 24th district since 2021. This district includes parts of New Britain and Newington. Sanchez was first elected in 2020 over Republican Alden Russell.

Sanchez currently serves as Ranking Member of the house Labor and Public Employees Committee, as well as a member of the Appropriations Committee and Education Committee. He has been fighting for the values of his constituents on the city council for the past 10 years and is ready to bring a progressive voice to Hartford.

Raised by a single mother who always emphasized the importance of education and giving back to your community, Manny is ready to fight for the working and middle class families of New Britain and Newington. He has dedicated his entire adult life to public service. He served as a 5-term Alderman on the New Britain Common Council, where he is now the Democratic Leader.

Manny graduated from UCONN and worked in job development, connecting adults with job opportunities. During his time serving New Britain, Manny has worked tirelessly on behalf of working and middle class residents. He consistently fought for education funding, protecting our environment, and played a critical role in erecting a memorial park in New Britain honoring the 65th Infantry Regiment also known as the Borinqueneers.

Manny’s work in the community has been recognized by numerous organizations, such as the One Hundred Men of Color Award, Connecticut Magazines “40-Under-40,” and the New Britain NAACP. He stands for a public option so we can all have access to affordable healthcare, fully fund quality, equitable education no matter where you live, advocate for legislation that will support getting people back to work and provide resources for small businesses after COVID-19, work for fair taxation that doesn’t unfairly burden middle and working class families, protect natural resources to ensure a safe and healthy future for everyone, and support stronger pay equity legislation that will address inequities among minorities and women.
