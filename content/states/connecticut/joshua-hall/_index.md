Joshua M. Hall - Assistant Principal, Weaver High School & 7th District State Representative

Joshua Hall has over 25 years of public school teaching experience.  Joshua served Hartford Public Schools where the majority of his teaching experience was at Weaver High School.  While teaching, he was awarded the Apple Teacher Award, he was awarded the opportunity to travel to South Africa by the World Affairs Council.

After 12 years of teaching, he was elected by his colleagues to serve as First Vice President of the Hartford Federation of Teachers. He served the teachers of Hartford for 12 years.  During that time, he was elected to serve on the executive board of the American Federation of Teachers CT and also elected to serve as Treasurer of the Connecticut Democratic Party.  In 2021, Joshua returned to Weaver, where he now serves as Assistant Principal.  

Joshua was born and raised in the City of Hartford.  While attending Hartford Public High, he and his friends pledged to come back and serve the city they love.  The pledge he and his friends made was chronicled in the book “House of Good Hope.” Joshua attended Norfolk State University. While there he competed on NSU’s Honda Campus All-Star Challenge Team. Upon graduating from Norfolk State University in Norfolk, VA with a degree in History Education, he returned home to begin his career as a History Teacher at Weaver High School.   Joshua also holds a Master’s degree in Education Leadership from Central Connecticut State University.

Joshua’s experiences have made him keenly aware of the opportunities and challenges his community faces.  As a result, in 2017, he was elected as state representative for the 7th Assembly District in Hartford.  His vision for the 7th District is a renewed focus on neighborhood community schools, neighborhood revitalization, safe neighborhoods, and job and retirement security.  Joshua has been recognized by many organizations in Connecticut, namely the 100 Men of Color and the CT NAACP Most Influential Blacks.

He and his wife Timcia reside in the Blue Hills neighborhood of Hartford with their two sons, Joshua II and Jonathan.
