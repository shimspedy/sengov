State Representative Antonio "Tone" Felipe is proudly serving his third term representing the 130th district (Bridgeport) in the State House of Representatives. Born and raised in Bridgeport, Tone is a proud product of the community he now has the honor of representing. At an early age he was dedicated to service, volunteering at the Annual Three Kings Day event in Bridgeport as well as Connecticut Central Coast YMCA and Bridgeport Caribe Youth Leaders. This work eventually led Tone to become a community and political organizer, being the youngest field coordinator in the 2014 gubernatorial race at 18 years old and registering thousands of Bridgeport residents to vote.

Rep. Felipe has earned numerous leadership positions in state service, he was appointed the youngest Deputy Majority Leader in our Stateâ€™s history in 2020 at 24 years of age and is Co-Chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee for early childhood and primary education. Tone now serves on the Appropriations, Education and Environment Committees. He also serves as Vice Chairman of the CT Black and Puerto Rican Caucus, where he unapologetically fights for equitable progress for black and brown communities, especially through public education, public health initiatives and housing opportunities.
