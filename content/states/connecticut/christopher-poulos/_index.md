Christopher Poulos is a member of the Democratic Party and represents District 81 in the Connecticut House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 4, 2023, and his current term ends on January 8, 2025. Poulos ran for election to the Connecticut House of Representatives to represent District 81 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Born and raised in Southington, Connecticut, Poulos graduated from Southington High School in 1993. He earned a B.A. in leadership studies with a double minor in business administration and Spanish in 1997 from the University of Richmond. He also holds a master's degree in the teaching of Spanish from Columbia University, which he received in 2003.

Poulos has dedicated his career to education. He works as a teacher at Joel Barlow High School in Redding, Connecticut, and has also served as a teacher-leader in residence with the Connecticut State Department of Education. In addition to his work in the classroom, Poulos has participated in numerous education fellowships, including the inaugural Teacher-Leader Fellowship hosted by the Aspen Institute. He has served on several non-profit boards of directors in the education sector, where he was responsible for scaling organizational capacity and outcomes, fundraising, and cultivating partnerships with government, philanthropic, and corporate organizations.

Before his career in education, Poulos served in the United States Peace Corps from 1997-1999 in Honduras, Central America. He is a lifelong Southington resident and has chosen to settle with his wife, Helen, and two children, Molly and Andrew, in Plantsville.

As a state legislator, Poulos has advocated for budgets that put students and taxpayers first, supported seniors and veterans, championed small business, and addressed the uptick in crime on a bipartisan basis. During his first term, Poulos has made it a priority to collaborate with like-minded legislators, work across party lines, and remain committed to a moderate approach that involves compromise, negotiation, and working together.
