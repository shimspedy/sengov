State Representative Joe Zullo is serving his third term representing East Haven’s 99th House District. Zullo was named Ranking Member of the Planning and Development Committee in 2023, and also serves on the Housing and Finance, Revenue and Bonding.

Zullo, an attorney, is a partner with his father in the private general law practice of Zullo, Zullo, and Jacks in East Haven. He has served as Town Attorney for the Town of East Haven since 2011. He lives in East Haven with his fiancée.

He graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2007 from Providence College, in Rhode Island, with a B.S. in Political Science.  He went on to study law at Quinnipiac University in the school’s night division and graduated with honors in 2011 as the recipient of the CATIC Foundation Award for his mastery of the areas of property law and real estate law. In November of 2011, at 26 years old, Zullo was appointed by Mayor Joseph Maturo, Jr. as the youngest Town Attorney in East Haven’s history and has served in that capacity for the last seven years.

Zullo is a member of the Board of Directors of the East Haven Chamber of Commerce.  He is also a volunteer with the East Haven Fall Festival Committee, the East Haven Community Classic 5K Road Race Committee, and the Momauguin and Joseph Melillo Middle Schools PTA/PTO Committees.  He is also a past and present judge for the East Haven High School Senior “Capstone” Program.  Zullo has also served as a guest lecturer on the topics of local civics and the “Freedom of Information Act” for both the East Haven Historical Society and the East Haven Memorial Library, Inc.

Recently, Zullo was awarded the “Town Crier Award” by the Connecticut Council of Small Towns which recognizes legislators who have made the case for local and small-town issues in the legislature.

Residents of East Haven selected Zullo as the 99th District state representative in a Feb. 26, 2019 special election.
