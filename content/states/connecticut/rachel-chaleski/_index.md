Rachel has the experience and passion to serve the people of her community. A resident of Danbury for over 20 years, Rachel is committed to continue to serve in the best interest of the city that is the pride and economic engine of Connecticut.

Rachel grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island, with her parents and three siblings. She holds a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biology from Concordia College, where she met her husband Carl. They were drawn to Danbury, because of its affordability, diversity, community and opportunity. Before her second child was born, Rachel made the difficult decision to leave her job in corporate finance to focus on her family. With a flexible schedule, she became deeply involved in the school and greater community. She has been an advocate for children from local policy to state funding. Rachel was elected to the Danbury Board of Education in 2017, and has served as Board Chair, Vice-Chair and Secretary.

As an elected official, Rachel understands the importance of being present in the community and accessible to her constituents. As State Representative, Rachel will work to ensure that Connecticut be an attractive place for future generations to work, live and thrive by restoring common sense in Hartford.
