Before being elected to the Senate, he was a State Representative for the 119th District from 2012-2014, where he served on the Higher Education Committee. Due to his distinguished service on the Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee, he was asked to serve on the Planning Commission for Higher Education and help develop a strategic plan for higher education in Connecticut.

Sen. Maroney founded First Choice College Placement in January of 1999 which aims to make young people’s higher education dreams come to fruition. First Choice College Placement also makes community service a priority and offers a number of educational seminars, donates to scholarships, and makes practice SAT and ACT tests available to the community. First Choice is a member of the Milford Chamber of Commerce and the Downtown Milford Business Association.

Prior to a successful career in public service, State Senator Maroney attended Yale (Class of 96), where he was a 3-time varsity letter winner in both track and field and cross-country. In his senior year, he was elected captain of the track and field team and was awarded the Yale Men’s Cross-Country Award for Performance and Dedication.
