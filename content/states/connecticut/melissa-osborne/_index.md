Melissa Osborne is serving her first term as the State Representative of the 16th House District, proudly representing the people of Simsbury in the General Assembly. As an attorney whose career has spanned twenty-five years, Melissa has extensive experience in everything from corporate and private equity real estate transactions and joint venture implementation to representing Connecticut's most vulnerable children and families. Melissa will bring her broad range of experience to bear in addressing the state's most pressing economic and social challenges. Melissa currently runs her own law practice in Avon.

Although this is her first year as a State Representative, Melissa is no stranger to the legislature. She fought to reform the family court system and protect victims of domestic violence. As a breast cancer survivor herself, she also advocated for changes to improve breast cancer screenings.

Melissa has been an active volunteer in her community, where she has served on Simsbury's Charter Revision Commission and Clean Energy Task Force. Melissa is also an elected alternate on Simsbury's Zoning Commission. In the legal arena, Melissa served as Vice-Chair of the Child Welfare and Juvenile Law Committee of the Connecticut Bar Association and on the Legislative Subcommittee of its Family Law Section and is a member of the Simsbury Regional Bar Association.

Rep. Osborne serves on the Appropriations, Judiciary, and General Law committees.

Melissa lives in Simsbury and is the proud mother of four grown children and a spoiled Golden Retriever, Boone.
