Chief Deputy Senate Republican Leader Henri Martin was reelected to serve his 5th term in November 2022 and is proud to continue representing Connecticut’s 31st Senatorial District which includes Bristol, Harwinton, Plainville, Plymouth and Thomaston.

Senator Martin serves as the Ranking Member on the Commerce and Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committees as well as the Transportation Committee and the Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee. Sen. Martin serves as a voting member on the State Bond Commission.

In 2019, Sen. Martin was named the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut State Senator of the Year in recognition of his strong support of the trucking industry and for his leadership in the fight against putting congestion-price tolls on Connecticut’s interstate highways.

In 2019, Sen. Martin was named a “Plainville Community Hero” by the Plainville Community Schools for his efforts on behalf of students, faculty and staff.

A goal of Sen. Martin’s has been the creation and adoption of definitions for the state spending cap, as well as structural changes to the state budget that will provide predictability and confidence for municipalities, businesses, and the people of Connecticut. In 2018. the budget agreement implemented this spending cap, in addition to a bonding cap and a volatility cap. These three successes, Sen. Martin believes, will improve the state’s economic climate and spur job growth. In the upcoming sessions, Sen. Martin will work to ensure the preservation of these important structural changes, pass legislation to promote fiscal stability and economic growth, increase access to workforce training for advance manufacturing, and tie education opportunities to the needs of the business community.

In Bristol city government, Senator Martin was a two-term Bristol councilman and was appointed as Acting Mayor in 2013. He served as Chairman of the Salary Committee, Chairman of the Building Committee and Chairman of the Bristol Public Work Committee.

He has also been a member of Bristol’s 10-Year Capital Improvement Committee and Public Works Board.

A longtime small business owner in Bristol, Senator Martin graduated from St. Anselm College and attended classes at the University of Hartford. He lives in Bristol with his wife Roxanne and has four grown children.
