Democratic State Representative Hector Arzeno was sworn in November 2023 for his first term representing the 151st District, which covers Greenwich.

Born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he graduated from the Catholic University of Argentina with a degree in Business Administration and completed an Advanced Management Program at Wharton School of Business. In 1974, he returned to the US for a training program with Morgan Guaranty Trust (today JP Morgan Chase), and in 1987, proudly became a US Citizen.

Hector has over 40 years of experience in International Finance where he served in executive positions and was a member of the Board of leading financial institutions in the United States, Europe and Latin America. He actively participated in forming an Inter-American Financial Institution with the IIC (Inter American Investment Corporation).

In 1986, he moved to Greenwich where he raised four children, and in November 2019, was elected to the Representative Town Meeting (RTM) in District 8, where he served as a delegate on the Finance Committee, an alternate on the Claims Committee, and the Labor Contracts Committee.

Hector has served as a coach for the Greenwich Youth Soccer League, volunteer for the Parent Board of Bucknell University, as member of the Sustainability Committee at GCDS, Greenwich High School Tour Guide and Science Department helper, and volunteered for the Greenwich Town Conservation Department.

Rep. Arzeno will serve on the Education, Environment and Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committees for the 2023 Legislative Session.
