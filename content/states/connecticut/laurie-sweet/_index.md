After completing my doctorate in Greek and Roman Art at the Ohio State University, I began my professional career as an adjunct professor at Ithaca College, before we moved to Connecticut in 2011. I then trained and became a birth doula for 7 years, where it was an honor and joy to be invited to support expectant families across the state. I was elected to the Hamden Legislative Council in 2021 and was re-elected in 2023 as chair of the education committee and vice chair of the sustainability committee. I will join the General Assembly in 2025 as the state representative for Hamden's 91st district.
