Representative Pat Boyd was first elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives on November 8, 2016. He is a lifelong resident of Eastern Connecticut. Boyd was born in Norwich and grew up in Moosup, where he attended public schools. He graduated from Plainfield High School and earned a B.A. from Eastern Connecticut State University and an M.A. from Sacred Heart University. Professionally, Boyd has been an educator for over 20 years and is currently a Dean of Students, Coach, and Teacher at the Pomfret School, a co-educational independent boarding school in Pomfret founded in 1894.

In the local community, Pat is an active Volunteer Firefighter/Emergency Medical Responder with the Pomfret Volunteer Fire Department, serving as the Company President since 2014. He is a Corporator of Day Kimball Healthcare, a Member of the Fire District Board of Directors, a Justice of the Peace, and serves on other local non-profit boards. As a youth, Pat earned the rank of Eagle Scout and is currently active in Scouting as the Camp Director of the June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation in Ashford.

In 2016, he was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives and currently serves as the State Representative for the 50th Assembly District. In the State House, he sits on the Joint Committee on Veterans' & Military Affairs, Committee on Children, and was appointed in 2021 by Speaker of the House Matt Ritter to serve as the House Chairman of the Public Safety & Security Committee, which has oversight of the Connecticut State Police, Homeland Security, Civil Preparedness & legalized gambling. Previously, he served as an Assistant Majority Leader.

Rep. Boyd has been recognized by a number of organizations for his service to the state, including leadership awards from the Connecticut Farm Bureau, Connecticut State Firefighters Association, the Connecticut Police Chiefs Association, the Connecticut & Rhode Island Alliance of YMCA’s, Police Officers Association of Connecticut and the United States Department of Defense.

Boyd is a strong believer in Connecticut’s Quiet Corner. The region has unique rural qualities and is a great place to live, work and play. He strives to be an independent voice for the residents of the 50th District, an area that is often overlooked by state leaders. Representative Boyd looks forward to the challenges ahead and invites you to contact him by emailing him.
