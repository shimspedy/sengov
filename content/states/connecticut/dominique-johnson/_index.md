Rep. Johnson learned the value of hard work and giving back to our community at a young age from her family while growing up in the Midwest. She is driven by the belief that young people deserve a future where their hard work can be rewarded and they can achieve their dreams just like she has had the opportunity to in Norwalk.

Rep. Johnson was elected to the state legislature in 2022. They currently serve as Deputy Majority Caucus Chair and Assistant Majority Leader. Additionally, they are in the Education, Higher Education & Employment Advancement and Judiciary Committees. Before joining the legislature, Rep. Johnson served two-terms as an at-large elected member of Norwalk's Common Council and Chair of the Community Services Committee where she worked to improve the quality of life for all of Norwalkâ€™s residents in collaboration with the City and its community partners.

She has also worked as a nonprofit consultant, a college professor, and is a published researcher. Rep. Johnson earned their PhD in Urban Education Policy from Temple University, an MA in Communication from Stanford University, and a BA in Communication Studies from Bryn Mawr College. She proudly lives in Norwalk with her partner Billie, their dog Rey, and their cat Scooter.
