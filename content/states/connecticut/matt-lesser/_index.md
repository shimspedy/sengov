As Deputy Majority leader he is the Chair of the Human Services Committee and Vice Chair of the Housing Committee

He is also member of the Appropriations, Energy & Technology, Judiciary, and Labor & Public Employees Committees.

He played an instrumental role in the passage of the Mental Health Parity Act (PA 19-159) that would ensure insurance coverage for people in the state suffering from mental health and substance use disorder conditions as they would for other illnesses.

As a cancer survivor, he knows all too well the struggles families face when dealing with their personal health issues or of the issues of their loved ones. Senator Lesser continues to fight for access to high-quality and affordable healthcare and prescription drugs for individuals and small businesses.

Sen. Lesser wrote the nation’s first Student Loan Bill of Rights, which established the Office of Student Loan Ombudsman to regulate student loan servicers and educate students and their parents on the student loan process.

Before being elected to the State Senate, Sen. Lesser was a State Representative for the 100th District in Middletown from 2008 to 2019. He was the chair of the Banking Committee from 2015 to 2019.

Sen. Lesser lives in Middletown’s North End with his wife Sarah and their dog, Lucy.
