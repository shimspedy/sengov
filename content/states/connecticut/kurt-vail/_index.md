State Rep. Kurt Vail proudly represents the 52nd District of Somers, Stafford, Union, and Woodstock. He was re-elected to his fifth term in November 2022. He currently serves as the Ranking Member to the Veterans’ and Military Affairs Committee, and also serves on the legislature’s Aging, Commerce, and Public Safety committees.

Rep. Vail has nearly eight years of experience in the insurance industry and currently is an agent for Paradiso Insurance, located on East Main Street in downtown Stafford Springs. He is licensed in property acquisition and casualty, as well as life and health insurance.

Prior to serving in the General Assembly, Rep. Vail was a member of the Stafford School Board, and Stafford’s Downtown Revitalization Committee along with its Recreation Commission. Additionally, he has been active in mentoring and coaching youth sports, including the Stafford High School team from 1998 to 2000. Rep. Vail has also served on the Stafford Youth Football board since 2006, and was president of the board from 2007 to 2009.

Rep. Vail crafted his campaign on his understanding of the proper function of state government. He has been integral in addressing central Connecticut’s crumbling foundation issue, leading the conversation in Hartford. He has also taken a strong stance on regressive taxes, voting against any new ways – or schemes – the majority proposes to levy more dollars from Connecticut’s businesses and residents.

Earlier in his legislative tenure, Rep. Vail also focused on issues impacting the district, including a brownfield remediation package to rectify the blighted Somersville Mill. He also engaged with members of the community in order to combat the rising opioid addiction crisis by meeting with Somers and Stafford police authorities, hospital administrators, and emergency services first responders. He went on to co-sponsor legislation that created a mechanism for the community’s first responders to gain easier access to drug-overdose reversal medication.

Rep. Vail is a proud father of his four children: Hannah,  Noah, Sarah, and Vivian.
