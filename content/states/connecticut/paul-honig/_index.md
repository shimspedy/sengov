Senator Paul Honig was sworn into office in 2025 as the first Democrat in nearly six decades to represent Connecticut’s 8th State Senate District, which includes the communities of Norfolk, Hartland, Canton, Simsbury, New Hartford, Avon, Barkhamsted, Colebrook, and portions of Granby, Harwinton, and Torrington.

During the 2025 – 2026 legislative sessions, Senator Honig will serve as Senate chairman of the legislature’s Veterans’ and Military Affairs Committee as well as vice chair of the Banking Committee and the Government, Administration and Elections Committee.

Additionally, Senator Honig is a rank-and-file member of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding; Insurance & Real Estate; Planning and Development; and the Public Safety and Security Committees.

Senator Honig is a resident of Harwinton, where he lives with his wife, Diane, and their two sons. He is currently serving his third term on the town of Harwinton’s Board of Selectmen, where he has helped to develop fiscally responsible budgets and encourage regional cooperation.

Senator Honig spent more than two decades working in the financial services industry solving complex financial problems. He developed analytical software for bond traders and salesmen and worked on an interest rate trading desk, achieving the title of managing director at JPMorgan Chase Bank.

In addition to his work in the finance sector, Senator Honig has broadened his experience through work as a mathematics teacher and through volunteer roles as treasurer of his synagogue and treasurer of Region 10 Make a Mark, a local charity that provides education enhancement grants to Region 10 students and teachers.
