State Representative Kerry Wood is representing the residents of Connecticut’s 29th House District, which is comprised of the towns of Rocky Hill and Wethersfield. She is dedicated to addressing the issues facing the district which include fighting to properly fund schools, addressing the rising costs in the state, protecting the environment, and working towards a modern rail and roads system to ease congestion as well as provide alternatives to driving.

Rep. Wood currently runs the Connecticut operations of a commercial real estate company specializing in retail. Through her extensive experience in business, she seeks to bring innovative ideas to the Capitol to foster economic growth and attract new businesses. Some of those ideas involved investing in a college loan pay-off program to attract skilled workers, collaborating with Connecticut businesses and bolstering the small business sector through streamlining loans and incentives.

She is also passionate about the schools in her district. Rep. Wood is a graduate of the Rocky Hill Public School system and is determined to obtain the appropriate level of state funding through the education cost-sharing formula, which provides districts with funding to reduce the cost to taxpayers.

In addition to education and the economy, she is a strong environmental activist. She started one of state’s first organic farms and supports sustainable, local, and organic farming practices. She supports investing in renewable energy like wind and solar, and is fiercely opposed to natural gas fracking waste and pipelines.

Rep. Wood is a current member of the Rocky Hill Democratic Town Committee and served as president of the CT Young Democrats.

In Hartford, Rep. Wood will bring her experience, inventive leadership, and track record of success to make the difficult decisions necessary to fix the state budget crisis and promote safe and productive communities.
