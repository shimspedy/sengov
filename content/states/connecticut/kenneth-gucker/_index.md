A resident of Danbury for more than 35 years, Ken Gucker was raised in New Fairfield where he attended and graduated from New Fairfield schools, was active in Scouting with Boy Scout Troop 42 where he attained the rank of Eagle Scout with Three Palms, and served a stint as a volunteer firefighter.  He is a graduate of Western Connecticut State University with a Bachelor of Arts degree.  Ken’s parents still reside in their New Fairfield home and are active participants at the New Fairfield Senior Center.

In Danbury, Ken has been active in land use, environmental, conservation, and historic preservation issues.  Among the local and neighborhood issues in the forefront of his activities, Ken Gucker has been an active leader on matters such as the Cotswold development plan where he fought alongside Danbury neighbors to limit density to balance the need to protect the environment and adjacent water sources. He worked with the Long Ridge Neighborhood Preservation Association to thwart an effort to allow variances for a new business use in a two-acre residential zone, thereby protecting the integrity of this scenic neighborhood.  He fought to preserve the historic John McLean House on Danbury’s Main Street, one of the city’s oldest historic buildings.

A tireless leader, advocate, and worker, Ken is a small business owner and a nationally renowned auto restoration expert.

He is a long time member of the Danbury Democratic Town Committee, and served as Vice-Chairman for three terms.  In 2018 Ken was elected to the Connecticut General Assembly as the State Representative for the 138th Legislative District, and re-elected in 2020.
