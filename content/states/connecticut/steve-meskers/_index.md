State Representative Steve Meskers was elected in November 2018 to represent the 150th district in Greenwich. He is House Chair of Commerce, and serves on the Energy and Technology, Finance, Revenue and Bonding and Insurance and Real Estate Committees.

Steve has a BA in Economics and Spanish and an MBA. In addition to a 35-year career in corporate lending, bankruptcy, and international bond sales, he has served 20 years on Greenwich’s Representative Town Meeting.

Steve supports gun safety and environmental protection legislation. As a member of the Coastal Caucus, he works to protect Long Island Sound in coordination with Connecticut’s Blue Plan.

He also worked on measures to protect vulnerable residents from unscrupulous third-party providers of electricity.

Now more than ever our state budget will need to reflect our new reality and Steve will continue to protect wallets and ensure that tax dollars are spent effectively.

A resident of Greenwich for 25 years, Steve lives with wife Monica and three children that are all graduates of the Greenwich public school system.
