In 2020, Jorge Cabrera was elected to represent the 17th Senate district which covers parts of Ansonia, Beacon Falls, Bethany, Derby, Hamden, Naugatuck and Woodbridge.

As a union organizer and workers’ rights advocate Jorge has been fighting for working families in the district and across the country for more than 25 years. 

Jorge’s father came from Puerto Rico in the 1960s to look for a better life. With no formal education but immense worth ethic, he and Jorge’s mother persevered to give Jorge and his brother opportunities they never had. Jorge’s father worked the graveyard shift as a foreman at an electrical fittings factory. He frequently had to work a 2nd or 3rd job to make ends meet. Due to the sacrifices and hard work of his parents, Jorge became the first in his family to attend college. During his time at Quinnipiac University, he met his future wife Rebecca. In 1998 he graduated, earning a degree in Political Science with high honors. 

After two years as a legislative aide to then-Speaker of the House Moira Lyons, Jorge spent nearly a decade as a researcher, wage enforcement specialist, and organizer for the Carpenter’s Union. His work focused on ensuring prevailing wage laws were followed by employers and protecting members from wage theft. 

Jorge eventually moved to the 1.3-million-member United Food and Commercial Workers International and worked as an international representative. Jorge traveled around the country helping workers preserve their respect and dignity on the job. In 2008, Jorge was loaned out to President Obama’s campaign to organize in battleground states like Ohio and North Carolina. 

Today, Jorge serves as a business representative and Director of Organizing for UFCW Local 919 in Farmington. In 2019, Jorge was one of the key leaders in the historic Stop and Shop strike. Over 35,000 workers throughout New England walked off the job to demand better treatment-----and won.

Jorge and his wife Rebecca, a public-school principal,  live in Hamden with their twin fifteen-year-old sons, Jorge and Gabe, both of whom attend Hamden public schools.
