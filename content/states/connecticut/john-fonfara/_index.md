John Fonfara, a lifelong resident of Hartford, grew up and lives in the city’s South End. Educated in Hartford public schools, he holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from the University of Connecticut and a Master’s degree in Public Policy Studies from Trinity College.

Senator Fonfara represents the 1st Senatorial District communities of Hartford and Wethersfield. First elected to the General Assembly in 1986, he represented the South End in the House of Representatives for 10 years, and is presently serving his thirteenth term in the State Senate.

He has served on many committees in his 34 years as a legislator, and is currently Senate Chair of the Finance, Revenue & Bonding Committee, where he helps to keep a careful eye on the state’s finances and budget.

As former Senate Chairman of the Energy & Technology Committee, Senator Fonfara was a consistent advocate for reform of Connecticut’s inefficient and highly expensive energy system. He has championed passage of multiple pieces of landmark legislation to produce savings for Connecticut energy consumers, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and encourage new local production of clean, renewable energy. His major legislative accomplishments on energy include Public Act 07-242 in 2007 and Senate Bill 493 in 2010 (vetoed by the governor), and Public Act 11-80 in 2011.

Senator Fonfara has fought for improvements in many other areas of public policy during his tenure, including reform of Hartford’s education system, enhancing and protecting quality of life in urban and suburban neighborhoods, and securing $10 million in state funds toward the clean-up and preservation of Wethersfield Cove.
