Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco represents the 80th General Assembly District of Wolcott and a part of Southington.  She was reelected in November 2022 to her third term. She was appointed as Assistant House Republican Leader and serves as Ranking Member of the Government Administration and Elections, as well as a member of the Children and Human Services committees.

Gale is the daughter of the late Charles and Marie Lanza and was raised in Waterbury, Connecticut along with her 5 brothers and sisters.

Gale has been married to her husband Angelo Mastrofrancesco for 37 years and in 1996 they moved to Wolcott to raise their two children. She has been employed by AT&T Advertising as a sales manager and for Benchmark Senior Living at The Village at Kensington Place in Meriden as Director of Community Relations.

Gale formed her ideas of civic responsibility early on watching her mother, Marie, who served on the Waterbury Board of Education for sixteen years. Gale credits her mother with being the reason she decided to seek office, saying that her motherâ€™s long history and dedication to public service was her inspiration.

In 2009 Gale was elected to the Wolcott Town Council and has held the role of Vice-Chairwoman for the past 7 years. She is the chair of the Town Negotiations Committee and also serves on the Finance Committee. Her experience with the Town Council has given her the insights and experience to tackle the hard issues with determination.
