State Representative Karen Reddington-Hughes was elected to serve the people of Bethlehem, Litchfield, Morris, Warren, and Woodbury and the 66th District in November 2022, and took the oath of office on January 4, 2023, to begin her first term as a member of the Connecticut General Assembly.

Representative Reddington-Hughes has lived and worked in Woodbury since 1990 and has been engaged in the community with various volunteer and elected positions, including serving two terms as Selectman. She has owned and operated Abrash Galleries on Main Street for more than 18 years.

Locally, Representative Reddington-Hughes has served as President of the Woodbury Antiques Dealers Association, President of the Woodbury Connecticut Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the Woodbury Business and Economic Development Committee. She is a founding member and serves on the Board of Directors of the Connecticut Summer Opera Foundation, and is a member of the Woodbury Junior Women’s Club, Library Board of Trustees, Flanders Nature Center Art Committee, and Pomperaug River Watershed Coalition.

During her tenure as President of the Woodbury Antiques Dealers Association, Representative Reddington-Hughes worked with the late Senator Rob Kane to establish the Connecticut Antiques Trail. Following many visits to Hartford and two Senate Bills the trail was established. Upon passage of that legislation Karen worked with the state Department of Economic Development and Department of Transportation to ensure funding and placement of signs. As a result, Connecticut tourism marketing could promote the state’s respected antiques industry alongside the popular wine trail.

As Chairman of Woodbury’s Business and Economic Development Committee, Representative Reddington-Hughes coordinated the effort to publish a guide promoting Woodbury and its businesses. The self-funded project received state-wide accolades when Reader’s Digest designated Woodbury “Most Charming Small Town in Connecticut”.

In 2018, Karen received the State of Connecticut Governor’s Award for Tourism Partner of the Year. The award was presented in recognition of the excellent marketing efforts of both the Connecticut Antiques Trail and the Town of Woodbury. Representative Reddington-Hughes has participated in state-level tourism focus groups and economic development summits throughout the region.

Representative Reddington-Hughes believes that the cultural values of the people of the United States result from the freedoms protected by the Constitution as the foundation for all other laws, and that it is our responsibility to preserve and protect those freedoms.  She believes we are responsible for ensuring future generations understand the history, heritage, rights, and responsibilities of citizenship.

Representative Reddington-Hughes has been awarded the Rosenberg Award for Community Service and Governor’s Award for Tourism Partner of the Year. She has attended The Campaign School at Yale, Connecticut Community Foundation- Western Connecticut Leadership Program, and the Charter Oak Leadership Program.

Representative Reddington-Hughes and her husband John Hughes, a graduate of the US Naval Academy and former US Naval Officer, have one son, John, a graduate of Nonnewaug High School.
