MD Rahman was elected in 2022. He was elected by the highest margin in 4th district history to represent Andover, Bolton, Glastonbury, and Manchester.

MD immigrated to the United States over two decades ago with little more than the American Dream in his back pocket. MD had a number of minimum wage jobs. His first job was working as a waiter. So was his second. And his third. But he worked hard, saved what he could, and from that humble start, he eventually opened an import/export business. Today he is the CEO of several businesses in healthcare, construction, and real estate investment. MD has employed and created over 5,000 jobs right here in Connecticut. MD has a degree in Business and Accounting.

MD may be a newer face in the state legislature, but he has been a consistent and influential voice on civic issues. He currently serves on the Governor's Hate Crime Advisory Council, and is a former member of the 2020 CT Census Advisory Board. MD has also served on the Manchester Charter Revision Commission and the Property Maintenance Board of Appeals.

He serves on the executive board of the Central CT Chamber of Commerce, as well as serving as the Vice Chair of the Central CT Education Foundation. He is the founding President of the Centennial Lions Club and the former Co-Chair of the Connecticut Asian American and Pacific Island Caucus (AAPI).

Giving back to the community has always been a passion for MD. In 2021 he founded the Bangladesh Bhaban Community Center in Manchester. This community center functioned as a COVID vaccination clinic early on and has been a valuable resource for residents. The center has held rent assistance workshops, citizenship preparation classes, and has given away thousands of boxes of food to help fight food insecurity. MD Rahman lost several family members to COVID-19, and this tragedy is one of the reasons he founded the vaccination clinic. He distributed over 15,000 COVID-19 rapid tests to those in need, and early in the pandemic he secured PPE, masks, and sanitizer for the community.

MD Rahman has been recognized frequently for his charitable and philanthropic work. He is a continuous supporter to Connecticut Mutual Aid, Hands on Hartford, Distressed Children and Infants International, Pathfinders Association of Manchester, MACC Food Pantry, the Steam Lab in Glastonbury and other local organizations.

He has received congressional recognition from Congressman John Larson for excellency in long time community service to the state of Connecticut. MD was also awarded excellence in service to the State of Connecticut by Lt. Gov. Bysiewicz for his response to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as his non-profit work. He was recognized by the Manchester Board of Directors and Mayor Jay Moran for his commitment to community services. He has been awarded outstanding leadership and service from the Lions Club. He was awarded an excellence in leadership in business and community service from the Federation of Bangladeshi Association of North America (FOBAN). MD has been recognized and awarded by the Bangladesh Christian Association of Connecticut (BCAC). For his support of Distressed Children and Infants International MD has been recognized by Dr. Debroff, a professor at Yale and President of Distressed infants International, for his support of orphan children.

MD Rahman lives in Manchester with his wife, Yelena, and their 3 children.
