State Representative Bill Buckbee proudly serves the 67th Assembly District, the Town of New Milford. Rep. Buckbee was elected to his fourth term in November of 2022, and serves as the Ranking Member of the Energy & Technology Committee. He also serves on the Human Services, and Veterans’ and Military Affairs Committees.

Throughout his service to the Town of New Milford and State of Connecticut, Rep. Buckbee has successfully helped pass legislation to address the opioid crisis. Additionally, he helped the state’s manufacturers, like Kimberly-Clark, utilize a range of energy resources to secure a healthy workforce and harden the state’s energy delivery structure. He also introduced New Milford Day in 2017, which is an annual day of action for New Milford organizations – ranging from non-profits to local businesses.

Rep. Buckbee has been an integral part of the New Milford community by organizing several local events and charitable fundraising for local and state-wide initiatives. He has also spent over 20 years coaching youth sports in New Milford, including basketball, baseball and football.

A New Milford High School Graduate in 1989, Rep. Buckbee went to college in Indiana only to return to New Milford. He also attended Western CT State University in Danbury, CT to study Business and Risk Management.

Currently, Rep. Buckbee works as the Executive Director of New Milford’s Harrybrooke Park, which is often referred to as a “gem” of the town. Additionally, Rep. Buckbee serves the New Milford community as Justice of the Peace.

Rep. Buckbee has previously served on the Town of New Milford’s Sewer Commission and Homeless Shelter Coalition.

Rep. Buckbee also has an acute business sense, which he will bring to Hartford. Prior to being elected, he was the Vice President of three unique start-up organizations within the community. Also, Rep. Buckbee is an active Freemason.

A fourth generation Native, the Buckbee family has influenced the New Milford community for years. Rep. Buckbee’s father, George C. Buckbee Sr., served as the town clerk for the Town of New Milford, but has since retired.  Additionally, George served with the New Milford Fire Department for 50 years, to which Rep. Buckbee is also a member. George has spent over 60 years as a member of the New Milford Community Ambulance Corps, and remains active.

Rep. Buckbee loves history, mostly early American history, and stands by the statement “Those who do not learn from history are indeed destined to repeat it. The history of our New Milford is wonderful, industrious and truly historic.”
