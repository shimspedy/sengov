Jason Rojas is proud to serve the 9th Assembly District, which is composed of parts of East Hartford and Manchester. The district covers much of southeastern East Hartford (Hills Street, Oak Street, Silver Lane, Forbes Street, as well as the Mayberry Village and Sunset Hills neighborhoods) and a portion of southwest Manchester (neighborhoods of Keeney and Verplanck elementary schools and Hillstown).

Jason serves as House Majority Leader. In this role, he will work alongside Speaker of the House, Matt Ritter, to shape policy priorities and is responsible for managing the legislative process.

A lifelong resident of East Hartford, Jason attended East Hartford Public Schools and was the first in his family to graduate from college, earning a history degree from the University of Connecticut and a master's degree in public policy from Trinity College.

Outside of the legislature, Jason serves as the Chief of Staff and Associate Vice President for External Affairs to the President of Trinity College. He has served on the board of directors of numerous nonprofits including three nonprofit housing development organizations and the Board of Trustees of the Boys and Girls Club of Hartford. Jason currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Manchester Community College Foundation, the East Hartford Alumni Association and Education Foundation and the iQuilt Partnership and is a Trustee of the Connecticut Historical Society.

Jason is a former member of the East Hartford Town Council, the Board of Education and the New England Association of Schools & Colleges Commission on Public Secondary Schools.

Jason's policy interests include government finance and tax policy, regionalism, affordable housing, education funding and literacy. He is committed to reforming government and how it serves the interests of people. Jason puts a particular emphasis on constituent service and encourages constituents to contact him with concerns, questions and ideas about how to move our district, communities and state forward.

Jason is married to his high school sweetheart, Sarah, and they have three children and three cats named Kix, Noodles and Lucky.
