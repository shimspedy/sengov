Renee LaMark Muir grew up in Ivoryton and attended Region 4 schools. She attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. She earned a bachelor’s degree (Magna Cum Laude) in criminal justice and a master’s degree (with honors) in law enforcement administration. She worked as a special investigator for the New York City Department of Investigation, assigned to a specialized unit investigating political corruption and governmental malfeasance.

After 10 years in New York, she returned to Connecticut to work as a principal analyst with the Connecticut General Assembly’s Legislative Program Review and Investigation Committee (LPRIC). LPRIC, a bipartisan oversight committee, conducted comprehensive policy reviews, program audits, and investigations into all areas of state government. As the criminal justice subject matter expert, she developed policy and system recommendations that were subsequently included in some of the most significant criminal justice reforms enacted by the state legislature. Among the projects and investigations that she conducted were police use of criminal informants, prison overcrowding and prison riots, community corrections - adult and juvenile probation, alternative sanctions, and parole services, the commercial bail system, mandatory minimum sentencing, tracking crime rates and recidivism, adult and juvenile substance abuse, police training and certification, and contracting issues at University of Connecticut (new build student housing).

In 2007, after 20 years at LRPIC, she joined the Harford Police Department, graduating first in her academy class. She started as a patrol officer and was promoted to detective, assigned to the Major Crimes Division, initially to the Adult Sexual Assault Unit, and then to the Homicide Unit, until 2016.

In 2016, she established Justice Solutions Consulting to provide data-driven, evidence-based, and cost-effective solutions and reforms to policymakers and criminal justice system administrators.

She also worked as a senior policy and research analyst with the Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy at the University of Connecticut, completing projects on the state’s reentry programs for formerly incarcerated individuals, police use of force, police car pursuits, sentencing outcomes for firearm-related offenses, and reviewing correctional systems in other countries.

LaMark Muir is involved in the Deep River municipal government as a volunteer member of the Economic Development Commission and the Zoning Board of Appeals and a member (and former chair) of the Deep River Democratic Town Committee.

She also volunteers as a sexual assault crisis responder for a regional nonprofit organization to support women and families.

LaMark Muir and her husband have lived in Deep River for almost 30 years.

She will serve on the Judiciary, Planning and Development, and Public Safety and Security committees.
