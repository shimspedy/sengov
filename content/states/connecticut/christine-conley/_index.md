Christine Conley was first elected in 2016 to be the State Representative serving Groton and Ledyard’s 40th Assembly District. She serves on the Judiciary, Planning and Development, and Transportation Committees

In her first term in the General Assembly, Christine worked to restore funding for schools in Groton and Ledyard, codify in Connecticut state law the "ten essential health benefits" set forth in the Affordable Care Act, and provide tax relief for the state's senior citizens. In her second and third terms, she helped pass legislation to support military families, protect reproductive healthcare, and prevent nonconsensual pelvic exams on vulnerable patients.

Prior to her service in the General Assembly, Christine was a three-term member of the Representative Town Meeting of Groton, and was elected Moderator in a vote of bipartisan support. She also served on the Golf Advisory Board for Groton Parks and Recreation and, through her years of service, has built positive relationships with the Town of Groton administrators and Town Council as well as other members of the community.

Christine is an attorney at Embry Neusner Arscott & Shafner, LLC. She is a Connecticut Board Certified Workers’ Compensation Specialist and a member of the Executive Committee of the Workers’ Compensation Section.

She received her Juris Doctorate degree from Western New England University School of Law and her Bachelor of Science degree from Bay Path University. She is a member of the Connecticut Bar Association, the New London County Bar Association, and the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association.

Christine lives in Groton with her husband, Tim Beebe. They enjoy golfing and spending time with their nieces and nephews. Her family has deep community roots and strong relationships with residents and the people she serves.
