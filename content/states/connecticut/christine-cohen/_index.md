Christine Cohen is the state Senator representing the needs and wishes of the approximately 100,000 residents in the 12th District towns of Branford, Durham, East Haven, Guilford, Killingworth, Madison, Middlefield, North Branford and Rockfall.

Senator Cohen is the Senate Chair of the Transportation Committee, Vice-Chair of the Banking Committee, and she sits as a voting member on General Law, Children and Finance, Revenue & Bonding committees.

Since beginning her first term in 2019, Senator Cohen has focused her public policy energies on protecting Connecticut’s environment, preventing gun violence, making Connecticut healthier, and strengthening the state’s economy. Senator Cohen led the passage of the Connecticut Clean Air Act and a statewide plastic bag ban. She led the Senate’s passage of Ethan’s Law on safer gun storage and helped to ban the production of untraceable ‘ghost guns,’. As a business owner herself, Senator Cohen has worked as a stalwart to reduce business taxes and burdensome regulation, expand workforce development training, institute a paid family and medical leave system beginning in 2022, and allow for the planting of hemp on Connecticut cropland - a brand new industry for our state. Other areas of policy focus include affordable healthcare and mental health supports, awareness and access.

Senator Cohen created and co-chairs the Coastal Caucus, a bipartisan group of lawmakers who focus on the issues affecting coastal towns, cities and waterways. She also uses the private-sector business experience she gained working for years at Fortune 100 companies like Stanley Black & Decker and Georgia Pacific to co-chair the legislature’s Bioscience Caucus, which seeks to strengthen and promote Connecticut’s robust life sciences and biotech industries.

In addition to serving in Connecticut’s General Assembly, Senator Cohen and her husband Rob also run a small business, “Cohen’s Bagel Company,” which has been growing and thriving for over 20 years on the Boston Post Road in Madison.

Senator Cohen has served on various boards and commissions in her hometown of Guilford, and prior to being elected to the General Assembly she served as Chair of Operations on the Guilford Board of Education. She resides in Guilford with her husband, three children, and their rescue dog Abby.
