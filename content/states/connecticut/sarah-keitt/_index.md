Representative Sarah Keitt moved to Fairfield in 2016 with her husband, Geordie, and two children, Lucy and Theo. Lucy is a freshman in college and Theo attends Fairfield’s public schools. Representative Keitt holds a Master’s in Public Health from George Washington University (GWU) and has over 20 years of experience as a public health advocate at the national, state, and local levels working to build healthier communities for some of our most vulnerable populations. A former adjunct instructor in community health at GWU, Rep. Keitt has also been published in several peer-reviewed journals on various issues relating to women’s health and health policy. She is excited to put her experience to work for the people of Fairfield and Trumbull.

In her first term, Rep. Keitt will serve as an Assistant Majority Leader, as Vice-Chair of the Committee on Children, and as a member of the Human Services Committee and Public Health Committee.
