Matt Blumenthal is State Representative for the 147th District, serving Stamford.

Chair of the Government Administration and Elections Committee, Matt also serves on the Judiciary (Vice Chair 2019–2022) and Transportation committees. He is also co-founder and co-chair of the General Assembly’s Reproductive Rights Caucus.

In these roles, Matt has been a leader fighting for gun-violence prevention, increasing fairness and transparency in our justice system, strengthening our democracy, women’s and worker’s rights, and making Connecticut a place where businesses can thrive.

In 2022, he co-authored and led passage of the Connecticut Reproductive Freedom Defense Act, a nation-leading law protecting residents, healthcare providers, and patients from out-of-state legal attack related to reproductive or gender-affirming health care. It was passed in anticipation of the U.S. Supreme Court’s overruling of Roe v. Wade. At least eight other states have since enacted legislation or executive orders based on its provisions.

In 2019, Matt authored and helped lead passage of the state’s ban on ghost guns and 3D-printed guns, as well as helping spearhead the movement to pass laws ensuring safe storage of firearms. Matt has been at the forefront of the efforts to expand the franchise in Connecticut. His bill expanding absentee-ballot access was passed in 2022. Matt has also been a fierce voice fighting on behalf of ratepayers to increase accountability and transparency for public utilities, as well as pushing for the sustainable, responsible budgeting that has led to a $3 billion rainy-day fund and multiple credit-rating increases.             

A Stamford native, Matt is immersed in the local community. He serves on the Board of Directors for the Boys & Girls Club of Stamford and is a member of the Springdale post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (Post 9617). Matt is also member of the Defense Council of the Truman National Security Project.

Matt received his Juris Doctor degree from Yale Law School. He earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard University, graduating with high honors. After graduating law school, Matt served as a judicial law clerk for Hon. Diane P. Wood, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

Before attending law school, Matt was an Infantry Officer in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, commanding a rifle platoon in Charlie Company, First Battalion, Twenty-Fifth Marines. He served roughly two and a half years on active duty and deployed to Marjah, Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

Matt is a trial attorney at the law firm of Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, P.C. He specializes in representing those who have been injured by negligence, misconduct, and deprivations of their civil rights. He has also served as a supervisor at the Peter Gruber Rule of Law Clinic at Yale Law School, which fought the Trump Administration’s excesses against the most vulnerable Americans, the environment, and the rule of law.

Matt is a homeowner in the city’s Glenbrook neighborhood.
