John Santanella grew up in Enfield and went through the public school system, Enfield Street School, JFK, and Enfield High. He graduated from Boston College in 1990 and in 1997 received his MBA in Marketing and Finance from the Carroll School of Management at Boston College as well.

After graduating from business school, Santanella worked for Parker Brothers (a division of Hasbro), Milton Bradley, and Nickelodeon TV Network, before returning to Hasbro in 2008. Corporate downsizing led to layoffs at Hasbro. Since then, John has been in the business of buying and selling small businesses in a variety of industry categories. In some cases, taking an active role in the management of the business, and others, acting as an advisor or consultant to the management team.

Santanella has served as Enfield’s Second District Town Councilor since November 2, 2021, and is currently the Democratic Minority Leader. He plans to remain on the Town Council.

Over the last three years, he has been fighting for education, supporting police, championing fiscal responsibility, promoting economic development, and working to reduce blight in the community.

In May 2022, Santanella introduced the first resolution to allow a pride flag to be displayed at Enfield Town Hall during the month of June in support and recognition of the LGBTQ community. That resolution was subsequently overturned by the current Town Council.

Santanella continues to be an outspoken council member on all matters shaping Enfield’s future. He believes schools are the cornerstone of the community, and that neighborhoods need to be safe places for children to play, for families to walk, and for our community to enjoy.

As a state representative, Santanella commits to fighting for children and education, in addition to legislation that promotes business around the state, especially small businesses, and key issues impacting business and working families such as affordable health care, childcare, and housing.

Rep. Santanella will serve on the Commerce, Planning and Development, and Public Safety and Security committees.
