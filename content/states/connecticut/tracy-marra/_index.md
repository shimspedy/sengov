State Representative Tracy Marra was elected to serve the people of Norwalk and Darien and the 141st District in November 2022, and took the oath of office on January 4, 2023, to begin her first term as a member of the Connecticut General Assembly.

For the 2023-2024 legislative session, House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora appointed Representative Marra to serve on the legislature’s Education Committee, Public Health Committee and Transportation Committee. As a trained pharmacist she is very excited to join the Public Health Committee. Both transportation and education are important issues in our community and across the state.

Representative Marra was born and raised in Lexington, KY, where her parents and grandparents taught her the value of taking personal responsibility, being self-reliant, and always helping her neighbors.  That deep sense of community, respect, and faith shaped her appreciation for hard work and a rigorous pursuit of academics.

Representative Marra earned her Doctor of Pharmacy degree from Butler University in 1999 and began her career as a community pharmacist before transitioning to a hospital setting where she was fortunate to work with health professionals from many countries.  Representative Marra is active in the Pharmacy Association and has served on the executive committee as Secretary, President, and Continuing Education Chair. She also worked with the regulatory board approving pharmacists and pharmacies.

She and her husband, David, have three daughters who proudly call Connecticut their home. Their oldest is in her first year of college, their middle child is in high school and youngest is in middle school. Furry friends are family, too, and they have four! Two dogs and two cats keep the Marra home lively and the family is very active. Between rowing, tennis, quiz bowl, and academics, they are very fortunate to still keep their tradition of ‘Friday Night Pizza’!

Raising a family is a full-time job, but Representative Marra has always found time to serve her community. She is currently a board member of the Darien Community Association, serves on the committee for the Darien Neighbors, Global Players speaker series, an annual fundraiser for the DCA.  Representative Marra and her family have also fostered kittens for Pitter Patter Feline Rescue – a fantastic grassroots animal rescue group focusing on kittens. In total, they have fostered close to 100 kittens in the past few years and even adopted one!

Representative Marra is also very involved in her kids’ schools and sports; co-chairing the beloved Pumpkin Carnival at Tokeneke Elementary, crew mom for her daughter’s rowing team, and running the school book fair are a few of the fun school activities that are labors of love.

Representative Marra is optimistic about Connecticut. Welcoming businesses, growing our economy, and improving educational opportunities are in our future. Moving forward with proper accountability and transparency in our state will be key to better governance.
