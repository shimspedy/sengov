State Representative Aimee Berger-Girvalo was elected in November 2020 to represent the 111th District in Ridgefield. She is currently in her second term.

In her first term, Aimee brought Ridgefield nearly $3 million in bonding dollars and grants, created a tax credit for parents who have lost a child in a stillbirth, and passed a Public Health bill that requires AEDs in gyms. Halfway through her second term, she collaborated on the development and passage of a bill that serves the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) community and passed a bill that expands lung cancer screenings to underserved residents.

Aimee is a graduate of UMASS Amherst. Throughout her career, she has managed multi-million dollar restaurant and retail businesses, worked as a preschool teacher and public school special ed paraeducator, and was most recently employed as a Behavior Therapist serving children on the Autism Spectrum and their families. Raised by a mother who served as an Army nurse during the Vietnam War, Aimee has been civically and politically engaged since childhood, serving as an advocate for those in need for as long as she can remember.

Aimee serves as Vice-Chair of the Transportation Committee and as a member of the Public Health and Government Administration and Elections Committees. She is a member of the Bipartisan Women's Caucus, the Climate Caucus, and the Intellectual and Developmental Disability Caucus.

A resident of Ridgefield for 18 years, Aimee lives with her two beautiful children; a daughter who recently graduated college and has started her career in the non-profit world, and a son in his senior year at Ridgefield High School.
