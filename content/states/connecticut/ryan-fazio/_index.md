A Deputy Republican Leader, Ryan was elected State Senator in August 2021 and re-elected in 2022. He represents the 36th District, which includes Greenwich, Stamford, and New Canaan.

Ryan is a Connecticut native, businessman, and an active volunteer in his community.

Born in Connecticut and raised in Greenwich, Ryan is a graduate of the Greenwich public schools. After studying economics at Northwestern University, he chose to return to Connecticut to start a career and build a life.

Ryan spent most of his career working in commodities markets, moving tens of millions of tons of agriculture and energy goods around the world, and specializing in renewable energy, including managing biorefineries, logistics,
and market risk.

Currently, Ryan works at a growth equity firm that invests in medium-sized businesses and advises their management to help them grow.

Ryan spent seven years as a volunteer tutor in inner-city charter schools and served on the leadership of the Associate Council of the KIPP charter school network. He also volunteers locally for Greenwich United Way and Meals on Wheels. Ryan has served on the Greenwich Representative Town Meeting, representing District 12, and he continues on the town’s Energy Efficiency Committee, which is focused on reducing energy costs in town government.

Ryan is the Ranking Senator on the legislature’s Energy & Technology Committee and Planning & Development Committee. He also serves on the Transportation Committee and the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
