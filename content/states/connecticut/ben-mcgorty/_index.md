Representative Ben McGorty was first elected in a special election July 22, 2014, and was most recently re-elected on November 8, 2022.  McGorty represents the people of the 122nd District which includes parts of the towns of Shelton, Stratford and Trumbull.

For the 2023-24 legislative term, Rep. McGorty will serve on the Commerce, Public Safety, Regulations Review, and Internship Committees. Ben also holds the position of Assistant House Republican Leader, which carries added responsibilities during debate on the House Floor.

Rep. McGorty believes that the point of government should be to make our lives better and to make them easier. He has noted that ever-increasing state spending is the biggest obstacle to that. He believes in fiscal responsibility and works as a fiscal watchdog in Hartford.

Professionally, Ben is a realtor with Coldwell Banker. He is a member of the Knights of Columbus and is active in local and statewide fire prevention efforts. McGorty is a Lieutenant / Deputy Fire Marshal for the town of Stratford and has served over  twenty-seven years as a volunteer firefighter with the Huntington Fire Department and is also on Sheltonâ€™s Board of Fire Commissioners.
