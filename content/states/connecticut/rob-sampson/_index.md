In November 2022, Rob Sampson was reelected by the people of the 16th Senate District to serve a third term in the State Senate representing the towns of Cheshire, Prospect, Southington, Waterbury and Wolcott. Previously, Senator Sampson served four terms as State Representative for the 80th district including Wolcott and Southington.

Sampson is widely known as an eloquent advocate for America’s core principles, restoring our system of limited, representative, constitutional government, protecting private contracts, and defending the natural rights of his constituents. He is the most outspoken advocate in the legislature for protecting election integrity and promoting government and budgetary transparency. He has dedicated himself to shedding light on how projects will be funded and if government funds are being used for their intended purposes. He has proven himself as a leader for several causes, challenging the Lamont administration’s budgets and policies including the introduction of tolls and forced school regionalization. He is also recognized as the legislature’s defender of the second amendment and protecting parent’s rights in education.

The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities in 2021 named Senator Sampson a “Legislative Champion of the Year” for his leadership in promoting transparency in government and budget matters during the 2021 legislative session.

Sampson’s ardent support for Connecticut’s economic competitiveness and business climate earned Sampson a 100% pro-business voting record according to the Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA). He was one of only two Senators to earn this distinction.

In his third term, Rob will persist in representing his constituents and ideals. He continues his role as the Ranking Republican on the Government Administration and Elections Committee and the Labor and Public Employees Committee. He also returns as a member of the Judiciary Committee and was named Ranking Member of the Housing Committee.

Sampson is unwavering in his defense of conservative ideals. Dedicated to creating a brighter future based on America’s founding principles, Rob’s been a registered Republican since voting for his first time at age 18 in 1988.

The Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC) honored Senator Sampson with its “Excellence and Achievement Award” for his 2021 voting record, which supported conservative principles in key policy areas.

An avid supporter of the Rights of the Individual and the Constitution, including the 2nd Amendment, Rob is a member of the NRA, a gun owner, and is active in the sport. He became widely recognized throughout our state and beyond in 2013 for his unyielding defense of Constitutional principles and law-abiding gun owners. He received the Legislator of the Year award from the Connecticut Citizens Defense League in 2012, his first year as a state elected official. Rob also received the NRA Defender of Freedom award in 2014.
