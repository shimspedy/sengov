State Representative Moira Rader was elected in November 2022 to represent the 98th District of Guilford and Branford. Upon being sworn into her role on January 4, 2023, she was named to the Education, Environment and Public Health committees.

Moira earned her Bachelor of Arts from Villanova University and her Masters of Science from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. She also holds a Connecticut real estate license. Moira has worked in the fields of architecture, historic preservation, interior design, planning and real estate for over 25 years.

While thrilled to be representing the voices of her community in her newly elected role, Moira has been active in public service for over a decade. She has served in leadership roles on school PTOs, volunteered in her local church as a children’s religious education instructor, given countless hours to local and statewide campaigns and has proudly served on the Guilford Board of Education, now in her second term, as Vice Chair.

Her experience as a community volunteer and public servant has given her the perspective and understanding of the issues that matter most to her community and will inform her work as a legislator: working to advocate for the needs and hopes of the people of Connecticut.

Moira lives in the Mulberry Point neighborhood of Guilford with her husband, four children and sweet goldendoodle. She is so honored to be representing her beloved community as their State Representative.
