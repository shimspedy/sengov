Jeff Currey, a lifelong resident of East Hartford by way of County Limerick, and a proud son, brother, and uncle, is currently serving a fifth term representing the 11th Assembly District, which is made up of parts of East Hartford and Manchester. Jeff, a former Deputy Majority Leader who chaired the Screening Committee on behalf of Majority Leader Rojas, currently serves on the Appropriations, Commerce, and Judiciary Committees. Starting in the 2023 legislative session, Jeff shifted leadership roles to take on the House Chair of the Education Committee, which he has served on since joining the legislature in 2015.

During his time in the legislature, Jeff’s accomplishments include:

Addressing Education Inequities:
Co-chairing the country’s first legislatively created 2-Generational Workforce and School Readiness/Success Advisory Council. Through his work with the 2-Gen pilot program, the State of Connecticut is working to change the state’s cycle of poverty to one of prosperity.
Reforming the state education funding system to ensure all students can access enriching, high-quality educational experiences. Jeff has been a leader in the fight for a fair and equitable student-centered state education funding system. In 2017, he successfully advocated for an updated and adhered to Education Cost Sharing (ECS) formula that determines state education funding.  Jeff is committed to ensuring all public school districts are included in the state’s funding model.
During the 2021 session, Jeff supported legislation updating the ECS formula to provide additional resources to communities with higher needs. He also advocated to expand access to childcare services for parents who are working on their education.
Championing LGBTQ+ legislative priorities:
Developed and fought to update Connecticut's Parentage Act to guarantee equal access to legal parentage and to protect Connecticut's wide diversity of family structures regardless of a child's circumstances of birth, or parents' marital status, gender, or sexual orientation. The governor signed this bill into law in 2021 and took effect January 1, 2022, allowing families to take advantage of these new benefits with the new year.
Co-sponsored Public Act 21-79 to provide state benefits to LGBTQ+ veterans discharged under the former "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.
In 2019, Jeff championed the passage of a ban on the gay and transgender panic defense, expansion of LGBTQ+ youth access to HIV prevention medication, and the creation of an LGBTQ Health and Human Services Network. During the 2021 session, Jeff successfully advocated for the inclusion of an additional $500,000 for the network.
In prior legislative sessions, Jeff lead the passage of legislation banning conversion therapy, the discredited practice of trying to change a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity, established the country’s strongest legislation to ensure the fair treatment of trans inmates within the Department of Corrections, included and expanded the definition of family in the state’s Paid Family and Medical leave program, and updated the state Military Department's nondiscrimination laws to prohibit denial of membership or promotion in the state's armed forces based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.
Bolstering protections for living organ donors. Rep. Currey, a kidney transplant recipient himself, introduced legislation in 2020 and 2021 to prohibit insurers from discriminating against living organ donors. The 2021 bill was voted out of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee.
Strengthening Connecticut’s Safe Haven Law. The Safe Haven Law allows any individual to leave a newborn child with hospital emergency room staff with no questions asked, preventing infant abandonment and death.
Heading a coalition of legislators to pass historic legislation addressing crumbling concrete foundations throughout northeastern Connecticut. The legislation provides financial assistance to homeowners to repair their foundations while taking steps to prevent the issue in the future.
Jeff graduated from the East Hartford Public School System and received his B.A. in Theater from Wagner College in New York City. After graduating from college, he found his way back to a life of public service, something embedded in him from the time he was very young. Giving back to the community is a family tradition he enjoys continuing.

Jeff is employed full-time with Goodwin University in East Hartford where he oversees the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) Employment & Training division, which provides free certification and associate degree programs to residents receiving SNAP benefits. Prior to joining the team at Goodwin, Jeff worked for the CT Department of Labor assisting in overseeing the Jobs First Employment Services Program for those on cash assistance throughout the state.

Before Jeff served as state representative, he was the Chairman of the East Hartford Board of Education, where he was first elected in 2009. Additionally, he served on the board of the East Hartford Community Resource Center as well as CABE (Connecticut Association of Boards of Education), where he held the position of Area Director.

Jeff is also a current or past member of several organizations, including:

East Hartford Adult Education Advisory Committee
Y.E.D.S. (Young. Educated. Determined to Succeed), a nonprofit providing youth with activities to elevate their minds and explore creative thinking skills
Little Theatre of Manchester
Lutz Children's Museum
CTGLC (CT Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce)
Foodshare, Strategic Planning & Program Development Committee
CCEH (Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness)
Hartford Gay Men's Chorus
Friends of the Wood Memorial Library and Museum, Board of Directors
Trans Formation Project, Board of Directors, a nonprofit educating individuals about anti-trans legislation in the United States
Donate Life Connecticut
In his free time, besides long walks on the beach, he enjoys trying to keep up with his six nieces and nephews, as well as taking in the many sights and trails that our beautiful state has to offer.
