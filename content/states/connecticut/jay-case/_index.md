state, representativeIn addition to being the Ranking Member of the legislature’s Internship Committee, where he helps young people learn about state government and policy, Rep. Case was a founding member of the first-ever Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) caucus. His bipartisan work on the I/DD Caucus brings members of the I/DD community into state policy-making decisions and provides them with a voice to improve the way government delivers supportive services to the community.

Before serving in the General Assembly, Rep. Case was a small business owner and active volunteer in northwest Connecticut. As a former small business owner, Rep. Case knows first-hand of what companies go through in Connecticut and recognizes struggles that come with different state policies. He launched his campaign for those reasons, and will continue to work his hardest for fellow small business owners like him.

Although he was raised in Winchester, Rep. Case’s great-grandparents owned and operated a dairy farm in Colebrook, where he learned the importance of hard work. His father, George, ingrained the importance of being an active member in the community.

Rep. Case lives in Winchester and has been an active volunteer with organizations like the Special Olympics, serving as a coach to his brother. He currently works as a commercial energy consultant and has prior experience in the construction industry.
