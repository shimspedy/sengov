Representative Jason Perillo has dedicated his life to serving others and to making his community a better place to live, work, and raise a family.

Jason served as the Chief of Shelton’s Echo Hose Ambulance from January of 2004 through 2008, working closely with police and fire department personnel to improve public health and safety throughout Shelton. A Shelton native, Jason began his volunteer career with Echo Hose in 1999.

In addition to his EMS work, Jason served Shelton residents as an Alderman and as Vice-Chairman of the Board of Apportionment and Taxation. He also served as a member of the City’s Planning and Zoning Commission where he was Chairman of the Planning and Zoning Subcommittee on Downtown Redevelopment. He was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2007, and was most recently re-elected in 2022.

In December of 2020, House Republican Leader-Elect Vincent Candelora (R-86) appointed Jason to the post of Deputy House Republican Leader, where he currently serves. Jason had previously served as an Assistant House Republican Leader and as House Republican Whip.

This session, Jason will serve on the following committees:

Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee
Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committee
Public Health Committee
Legislative Management Committee
Jason has authored or co-sponsored a number of laws that are already improving the quality of life for Connecticut families and are creating economic development opportunities throughout our State.

Jobs and economic growth: Jason worked with Commerce Committee leaders to draft ground-breaking legislation that encourages the redevelopment of contaminated industrial sites. This program has already benefited communities throughout the state including Shelton, which received nearly half a million dollars toward its redevelopment efforts.
School safety: Working across party lines, Jason authored and ushered through legislation that requires annual reporting of school fire inspections to local Boards of Education. He also opposed legislative attempts to shrink drug-free school zones around our public schools.
Helping our firefighters: Working with key Democrats and Republicans, Jason co-sponsored legislation that ensures career firefighters can volunteer in their hometowns. The law helps ensure the continued success of our local volunteer fire departments.
Supporting local farms and preserving open space: Jason spearheaded the passage of legislation that helps our local farms and farm wineries flourish.
Jason also serves the community on the Housatonic Council, Boy Scouts of America Advisory Board, as a member of the Shelton Senior Center Commission, as a Corporator for the Birmingham Group and the Parent Child Resource Center, and as a member of Shelton’s School Readiness Council. Jason also served three years as co-chairman of the Shelton Relay for Life, an overnight event which takes place in early June each year to benefit the American Cancer Society. He is a parishioner of St. Joseph Church and a member of the Sons of the American Legion, Squadron 16.

Jason received his Bachelor’s Degree from Georgetown University in Washington, DC and holds a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from Boston College. Jason also holds a Master’s Degree in Public Administration, which he received from Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

A lifelong Shelton resident, Jason, his wife Becky, and their daughter, Lydia, live on Coram Avenue in the house where his grandfather, former Shelton Mayor Vincent Tisi, Jr., grew up.
