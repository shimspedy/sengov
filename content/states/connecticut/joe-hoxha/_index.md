Joe Hoxha, born in post-communist Albania, immigrated to the United States with his family at 3 and a half years old back in 1996. His family left behind a tumultuous country in Eastern Europe with uncertainty as its best promise. Seeking a shot at the American dream, Joe's family settled in Bristol, Connecticut, where his parents first worked minimum wage jobs until finding good paying work in the city’s manufacturing sector.

Growing up in a working-class household in Bristol’s West End neighborhood, Joe learned the value of hard work very early on. He came through the Bristol public school system where he played soccer and wrestled for Bristol Central. Joe attended the University of Connecticut where he graduated with a dual bachelor’s degree in Political Science and Sociology.

Joe has always been an admirer and avid reader of American History, spending countless hours reading the biographies of former presidents and engaging in political debates with anyone that would entertain him. After college, Joe knew for certain he wanted to be involved in politics, so he began a journey across the country working on campaigns for Republican candidates for various offices. He worked on campaigns in Texas, Virginia, New Hampshire, Missouri, and right there in Connecticut, most of the time as a field director but also managing a few successful races himself. Notably, managing the successful sweep by the Plymouth Republicans of virtually every seat in the 2017 Municipal cycle.

After his cross-country trip, Joe decided to settle down in his hometown of Bristol, CT, where he bought his first home and became very active in Bristol’s and Connecticut’s Republican party. He is proud to be serving as a member of the Connecticut Republican party’s governing body known as State Central.

In 2019, Joe decided to make a switch into the financial services industry where he currently works full time for a local community bank. Nevertheless, he has never put the brakes on his passion, which is his commitment to civic engagement. Joe is proud to be a Republican candidate for the 78th State Rep district currently held by longtime Republican State Rep Whitt Betts. Whitt has done a terrific job over the years representing the good people of Plymouth and Bristol, and Joe plans to continue the strong conservative legacy of the 78th.

He believes that this state is at a crossroads, either it goes down the path of ruin or ushers in a new era in Connecticut politics that will undo the damage of single-party rule for decades and put Connecticut on the right path again.
