Representative Raghib Allie-Brennan was first elected to the Connecticut General Assembly on November 6, 2018 and is currently serving his third term.

The son of a small business owner, Raghib learned the values of hard work and integrity at a young age.

After graduating from Bethel Public Schools and Marymount Manhattan College, Raghib worked as a Congressional advisor in the U.S. House of Representatives. In that role, he developed an in-depth understanding of energy and environmental issues and emergency response/disaster relief policy.

At the start of his first term in 2019, Raghib was appointed Vice Chair of the Energy & Technology Committee and became Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Clean Energy Caucus. As Vice Chair, Raghib has helped pass legislation to support the stateâ€™s largest expansion of offshore wind energy and spearheaded the passage of solar energy legislation, increasing consumer choice and protecting over 2,200 local jobs.

In the wake of Tropical Storm Isaias, which devastated large portions of Connecticut and left many Eversource Energy ratepayers without power for more than a week, Raghib helped pass legislation to hold utility companies accountable for their performance and service in protecting customers and maintaining critical infrastructure.

In addition to serving as Chair of the House Select Committee on Sustainable and Renewable Energy, Raghib serves on the Public Safety and General Law committees and was appointed Deputy Majority Leader for the 2023-2024 legislative session. Raghib was raised in the Town of Bethel, where he currently resides.
