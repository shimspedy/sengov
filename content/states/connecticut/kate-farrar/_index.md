She also secured nearly $5 million in funding for the 20th District local community and economic development projects and nonprofit and arts support.

Representative Farrar was honored as a Woman of Excellence by the National Foundation of Women Legislators for her leadership to pass legislation to address menstrual equity.

Representative Farrar has over 20 years of experience as a non-profit advocate and active community volunteer. In her role as Executive Director of the Connecticut Women’s Education and Legal Fund (CWEALF), she led the passage of CT’s landmark Paid Family and Medical Leave Act in addition to advancing new laws for pay equity and increasing the minimum wage. Before her advocacy work at CWEALF, Representative Farrar expanded STEM education and leadership programs for 10,000 middle school girls and college women as the Vice President of Campus Leadership Programs at the American Association of University Women (AAUW) in Washington, D.C.

Currently, she serves as a Strategy Coordinator for Connecticut Foodshare.
