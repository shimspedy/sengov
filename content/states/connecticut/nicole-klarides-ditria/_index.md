State Representative Nicole Klarides-Ditria was first elected to serve the 105th district in 2016, and has continued to serve the people of Beacon Falls, Seymour, and part of Derby with distinction since.

For the 2023-2024 session, Representative Klarides-Ditria (R-105) was appointed by House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora to serve as Ranking Member of the legislature’s Public Health Committee. She will also serve on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee and the Regulation Review Committee where she previously held the title of Chair.  Representative Klarides-Ditria continues to serve in her leadership role as a Caucus Whip. Whips are traditionally responsible for helping to shape public policy, assisting Republican lawmakers and making sure all Republican House members are in attendance to cast their votes on legislative issues.

A lifelong resident of Seymour, Rep. Klarides-Ditria’s grandparents’ emigration from Greece in search of the American Dream had a tremendous impact on her commitment to community.  Following their daily example of hard work – they founded Klarides Supermarkets – Rep. Klarides-Ditria grew up working at her family’s supermarkets in Seymour and Derby where she learned the same values of hard work and putting her community first.

In 2011, Nicole was elected to serve on the Seymour Board of Selectman and was unanimously voted by Democrats and Republicans to become the Deputy First Selectman. Nicole was reelected to the Board of Selectman in 2013 and 2015; she stepped down from being the Deputy First Selectman after winning her election for State Representative.

Rep. Klarides-Ditria is a graduate of Quinnipiac University and has a successful career as a certified athletic trainer. She is currently the head athletic trainer at Lauralton Hall High School in Milford. She also has an active role in managing a number of business properties owned by her family. She is a proud member of the Works Hellenic Inter Parliamentary Association (WHIA).

Rep. Klarides-Ditria had the distinct pleasure of serving alongside her sister, former State Representative Themis Klarides (House Republican Leader – Orange, Woodbridge, and Derby) from 2016-2020. The siblings became the first sisters to serve together in the history of the Connecticut State House of Representatives.

Nicole lives in Seymour, with her husband, a retired Seymour Police Detective, and son.
