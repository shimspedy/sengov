Laura Dancho is a proud mother of 3 and loving grandmother of 4 who has built her whole life here in Stratford, CT with her husband, Gregg. Laura was first elected to the Stratford Town Council in 2017, unseating an incumbent member. With successful reelections in 2019 and 2021, she captured over 61% of the vote in a politically mixed district.

As a lifelong Stratford resident, Laura has served countless hours as a PTA Treasurer for Stratford Academy, a band parent at Bunnell High School, and as being a member of the Friends of Boothe Memorial Park, the Housatonic Boat Club, a Scout Leader, and an active member of Our Lady of Grace Church.

Currently employed at Fairfield University, she has always found the time to prioritize Stratford interests as Chair of both the Ordinance and Board of Education Liaison committees, preparing her for the next level of service in the state capital. With an emphasis on Public Safety, CT Affordability, and Local Issues, Laura is excited to prove her reliability, trustworthiness, transparency, and dedication to service as a Representative in Hartford.
