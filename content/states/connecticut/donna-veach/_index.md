State Representative Donna Veach proudly represents the 30th District in the Connecticut General Assembly and is serving in her second term in office after taking over a seat previously held by former Democrat Speaker of the House Joe Aresimowicz.

For the 2023-2024 legislative session, Rep. Veach will serve in her first leadership role being newly named Ranking Member of the legislatures Internship Committee by House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora. In addition, she will also serve as a member of the Environment, Judiciary, and Finance Committees.

She is also a member of the Conservative Caucus, Sportsmen’s Caucus, and Women’s Caucus.

Born and raised in New Britain, Representative Veach moved to Berlin more than 30 years ago with her husband Jeff, a Berlin Police Officer. Donna and Jeff have raised three daughters Heather, Callie, and Audra who have all gone on to become nurses, following in the footsteps of their grandmother.

Coming from a conservative Catholic family, Representative Veach has always believed in and supported conservative values; limited government intrusion, the rule of law, free markets, and protecting personal freedoms.

Representative Veach’s hobbies include gardening, canning, baking, and outdoor activities such as hiking, crabbing, and clamming. She is an avid lifetime hunter and enjoys hunting with her entire family. Her love for canning and baking led her to start a small business called Copperpott Farm.

Representative Veach is also a proud supporter of our state and local police, veterans organizations, small businesses, and non-profit organizations to name a few. She has also served as a member of the Berlin Town Council for the past six years.
