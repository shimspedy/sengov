State Representative Amy Morrin Bello was elected in 2020 to serve the residents of Wethersfield in the 28th House District. She currently serves as Assistant Majority Leader, Vice Chair of the Government Administration and Elections Committee (GAE), and member of the Transportation Committee and Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committee.

Rep. Morrin Bello is dedicated to addressing issues facing our communities, from championing voting rights, working to pass laws to assist our workforce and grow our economy and fighting for our families’ health and safety while making sure crucial funding comes back to Wethersfield. Amy believes government must run efficiently; elections should be accessible to all voters; health care, including women’s reproductive care, education, and childcare are basic human needs. She sees the overall improvement to the state's infrastructure as necessary to enhance our quality of life and to sustain a vibrant business environment.

Rep. Morrin Bello is a lifelong resident of Wethersfield and is employed at Wesleyan University. She and her husband Rich have three daughters, and both sets of parents living in Wethersfield. A lifelong volunteer, she brings a background in municipal experience to the legislature through her former employment as an Assistant Town Clerk, service on the Wethersfield Town Council, and as Mayor of Wethersfield. In 2022, she was honored as the Wethersfield Democrat of the Year and in 2023 she will be the Wethersfield Town Marshall in the Greater Hartford St. Patrick’s Day Parade.

Rep. Morrin Bello is currently a member of the Wethersfield Democratic Town Committee, Friends of the Wethersfield Public Library, the Wethersfield Historical Society, and the Church of the Incarnation.
