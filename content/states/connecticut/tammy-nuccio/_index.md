State Representative Tammy Nuccio proudly represents the 53rd General Assembly District, which encompasses Tolland, Willington and Vernon. She was elected to her first term in November 2020.

Rep. Nuccio was appointed as the Ranking Member of the legislature’s Appropriations Committee, which has cognizance of all matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies. Other issues under the committee’s jurisdiction include matters relating to state employees’ salaries, benefits and retirement, teachers’ retirement and veterans’ pensions and collective bargaining agreements and arbitration awards for all state employees.

Rep. Nuccio will return to the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, which has cognizance of all matters relating to insurance law and real estate law. Nuccio will also serve on the Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee, which addresses all executive and legislative nominations requiring action of either or both chambers with the exception of judicial nominations, nominations of workers’ compensation commissioners and nominations of members of the Board of Pardons and Paroles.

In addition, she sits on the Screening Committee, a select committee that reviews all legislation introduced in the chamber.

Nuccio was an early co-sponsor and helped lead her Republican colleagues in passage of House Bill 6588. The bill formally established Nuccio’s proposed Mental Health Service Provider Task Force, allowing lawmakers to identify and eliminate roadblocks preventing more mental health service providers from participating in provider networks. Nuccio was later appointed to serve on the task force by House Minority Leader Rep. Vincent Candelora.

Rep. Nuccio is a financial analyst for Cigna and an elected member of the Tolland Town Council. She has more than 30 years of experience in finance and is active within the community. Most notably, she has been involved with the Tolland Senior Center, Tolland Soccer, Saint Matthew’s Church and is a sitting board member on the Eastern Highland Health District.

Nuccio holds a Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree in Business Administration from Bay Path University. She is a 35-year resident of Tolland where she resides with her husband and three daughters.
