Marilyn Moore was first elected in 2014 to serve the 22nd State Senatorial District communities of Trumbull, sections of Bridgeport and Monroe. She is a lifelong Bridgeport resident. She is a mother, grandmother, and great grandmother. Marilyn attended Bridgeport public schools, Housatonic Community College, and the University of Bridgeport. As a disciple of Mount Aery Baptist Church she declares that God has blessed her abundantly and all the glory and honor belong to Him.

She is nationally known for her advocacy on behalf of breast cancer and is an active participant in the war against hunger, social justice, gun violence, and racial equity. Marilyn stays connected to information and advocacy groups by actively participating in projects whose mission address food access. She is on the Network Leadership team and the Connecticut Ambassador for the Food Solutions New England who seeks to build regional solutions to food sustainability within the New England States. Locally, Marilyn organized coalitions in Bridgeport to address food equity and as a result the City of Bridgeport formed a Food Policy Council.

Marilyn has always been involved in local politics and in 2013, she challenged a six-year incumbent for a State Senate seat and was successful in her bid to represent Trumbull, Bridgeport, and Monroe. She was sworn in on January 7, 2015 and is currently Chair of Human Services, General Bonding, and Vice-Chair of Finance, Revenue and Bonding, and is a member of Children; Executive & Legislative Nominations; Legislative Management and Public Health.

Marilyn is co-chair of CT Fatherhood Initiative, 2 Gen Advisory, the Governor’s Council on Women and Girls, and championing programs that address gun violence intervention and prevention in CT. In 2022, Marilyn secured over $2 million to address youth gun violence prevention. She also authored legislation to create a Commission on Gun Violence Prevention under the Department of Public Health.

Her commitments to her constituents are to address health equity, living wage and promote legislation that supports safe communities and protects the rights of all. During campaigns she seeks refuge in Psalms 27 and believes it is the pathway to Psalms 30.

Marilyn’s commitment to community is exemplified by the numerous awards and accolades she's received from organizations that she links herself to that include the faith community, health, and government.
