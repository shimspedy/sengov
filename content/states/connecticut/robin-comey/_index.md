State Representative Robin Comey was elected in 2018 to serve the citizens of Connecticut’s 102nd House District in Branford.

For the 2023 legislative session, Rep. Comey was appointed Assistant Majority Whip and a member of the Committee on Children, the Education and the Human Services Committees.  Comey previously served as House Vice Chair of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee.

An experienced advocate for the disabled community, Rep. Comey is currently co-chairing a Work Group Concerning Issues Affecting Deaf, Hard of Hearing and DeafBlind Persons and participating on a Community Hospice Ombudsman Workgroup. Additionally, as a Co-Chair of the Early Childhood Caucus Comey is working with NCSL and several state-wide organizations to build understanding and support among legislators on the role a strong early care system plays in the economic and family success of CT families.

A skilled coalition builder, she is dedicated to addressing issues facing Branford and Connecticut residents, from preserving the environment to advocating for policies that improve access to care and the health, safety and education of young children and their families. She is an effective leader in the legislature reaching bipartisan support and finding solutions beneficial to all state residents.  

During her first legislative session, she championed legislation to increase access to life-saving epinephrine in public places including theme parks, restaurants, day care centers, and overnight camps. Connecticut now joins 33 other states and the District of Columbia that have already passed similar legislation allowing public venues to maintain an epinephrine auto injector supply for anyone having a life-threatening allergic reaction.

Comey is a small business owner, and a non-profit leader who has worked relentlessly throughout Branford helping to improve the quality of life for residents.

She was inducted into the 2019 Branford Education Hall of Fame for her tireless efforts in improving education in Branford.

She worked, alongside other advocates, to make Branford the first school district in Connecticut to effectively institute food allergies policy and management which became the model for state-wide legislation that passed in the Spring of 2017.

Comey serves on the board of the Branford Historical Society, the East Shore District Health Department’s Community Health Improvement Project’s, and the Nurturing Family Network’s Advisory Board.

Robin is married and has a child at UConn and a child in Cooperative Arts & Humanities High School in New Haven. Her family lives in the Short Beach section of Branford.
