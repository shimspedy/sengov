State Representative Cristin McCarthy Vahey is serving her fourth term representing Fairfield's 133rd Assembly District. She is House Chair of the Public Health Committee and a member of the Government Administration and Elections, Planning and Development, and Transportation Committees.

Since her election to local office in 2005 and now as a legislator, Cristin has been committed to helping her community and our state thrive: planning for and creating healthy, safe and vibrant communities, supporting economic development and diversity, improving voter access and participation, and advocating for mental health and wellness initiatives.

In Cristin' role as the Planning and Development Committee Chair, she has been integral in modernizing and re-organizing zoning statutes to provide greater clarity and tools to local planning and zoning officials, empower towns and cities to facilitate economic growth, ensure inclusive communities, add energy and environmental protections to their zoning codes, and allow accessory dwelling units across the state. Cristin spearheaded legislation that creates a state Geographic Information Systems (GIS) office and advisory council, allows access to original birth certificates for all adult adoptees, and streamlines access for outdoor dining.

As a member of the Government Administration and Elections Committee, Cristin worked with committee leadership to expand voter accessibility, restoring voting rights to those on parole, and giving the CT voters the chance to vote on two Constitutional Amendments: one for early voting and the other to provide no-excuse absentee ballots to registered voters.

Cristin’s long-term advocacy on behalf of both public transit and active transportation, and safety resulted in a requirement for the use of back seat seatbelts for all ages and a groundbreaking bill for pedestrian and bicycle safety. The bill creates the nation’s first statewide Vision Zero council and provides multiple safeguards for those who walk and bike to work, school, or pursue exercise or recreational opportunities.

As long-time co-chair of Fairfield CARES Community Coalition, Cristin has spent over a decade working on youth wellness promotion and substance misuse prevention. She is a certified QPR (Question, Persuade, Refer) suicide prevention trainer. Her past volunteer service in multiple community organizations includes scouting, church groups, and civic organizations.

Educated at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Washington in the Master of Social Work program, she and her husband, Brian are parents to three children, all of whom attend or have been through Fairfield Public Schools.
