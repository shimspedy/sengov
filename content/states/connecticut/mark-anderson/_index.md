State Representative Mark Anderson serves the 62nd House District which includes Barkhamsted, Granby, Hartland, and New Hartford. He was elected to his second term in November of 2022.

Rep. Anderson currently serves on the legislature’s Commerce Committee, Labor and Public Employees Committee, and the Veterans’ and Military Affairs Committee.

The Commerce Committee oversees the Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD), Connecticut Innovations Inc., and related initiatives. The work of DECD has taken on renewed importance during the pandemic emergency and economic recovery efforts.

As a member of the Labor and Public Employees Committee, Rep. Anderson will address issues relating to the Department of Labor, collective bargaining, unemployment compensation, and related programs.

Anderson’s service on the Veterans’ and Military Affairs Committee will see him work on all matters relating to military and veterans’ programs, and oversee the state Department of Veterans’ Affairs.

Mark was born in Hartford and was raised in East Granby and Granville, Massachusetts. He has also lived in Springfield and Hampden, Massachusetts, and East Hartland. He attended schools in the region, graduated from Western New England University, and recently completed a Master’s in Public Policy from Liberty University.

Professionally, Mark has had a long career as an Army Reserve Officer in the Military Intelligence branch and worked full time as an Army Reserve civilian administrator. He also spent two and a half years mobilized to the Defense Intelligence Agency in Washington, D.C., and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel.

A resident of Granby since 2015, Mark lives with his wife Carole, and they have a blended family with three adult daughters, and two sons. Both Carole and Mark lost their first spouses to cancer.

In his spare time, Mark enjoys all of the outdoor opportunities the district has to offer for hiking, cross country skiing, fishing, hunting, and paddling on the Farmington River.
