State Representative Tami Zawistowski represents the 61st General Assembly District of Suffield, East Granby, and Windsor Locks.  First elected to the House of Representatives in an April 2014 special election, Rep. Zawistowski has earned re-election and continued to serve her district with distinction since.

Rep. Zawistowski is a member of the House Republican leadership team, serving as Caucus Policy Co-Chairman and as Chair of the House Republican Screening Committee. She is a member of the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee, Planning & Development Committee, and Transportation Committee. Previously, she served as Ranking Member of the Planning & Development Committee and was recognized as “Legislator of the Year” by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities (CCM), and a “Town Crier” by the Connecticut Council of Small Towns (COST) in 2019.

She is an active member of legislative advocacy caucuses, including the Rural Caucus, Manufacturing Caucus and the Arts, Culture & Tourism Caucus.

Professionally, Tami is a small business owner and a former bank executive vice president who also holds professional experience in real estate finance and property valuation.

Tami first ran for a seat in the state legislature out of concern about Connecticut’s financial future, particularly a state budget that tested the boundaries of the Constitutional Spending Cap and included levels of borrowing burdening future generations.

An East Granby resident, Tami seeks solutions to the problems that block Connecticut’s economic growth, specifically Connecticut’s reputation as a place that is unfriendly to business owners.

In order to improve our state’s ability to compete both regionally and nationally, Rep. Zawistowski continues to be a strong advocate for policies that create a more favorable tax and regulatory environment, encouraging both entrepreneurship and the expansion of existing companies.

Tami’s professional experience includes:
– Small business owner since 1996 – Resource Books, LLC.
– Former Assistant Director, UConn School of Business Center for Real Estate and Economic Studies
– Former Executive Vice President, Northeast Savings, F.A., Hartford

Her government and civic experience, and accomplishments include:
– East Granby Board of Finance member
– East Granby Economic Development Commission member
– Director, Bradley Regional Chamber of Commerce
– CT Leadership Council, National Federation of Independent Business member
– Past President, East Granby Chamber of Commerce
– Suffield Chamber of Commerce member
– 2011 Small Business Leader of the Year, East Granby Chamber of Commerce
– Member of the founding committee, East Granby Farmers Market
– Honorary member, Suffield Chapter FFA
