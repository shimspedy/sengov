Corey P. Paris has made it his life's purpose of committing his work and mission to public service and community activism. He holds firmly to the mantra that when society works to eradicate any form of inequality and work to bring marginalized communities together in the spirit of genuine cooperation, transformative ideas will drive life-changing action.

Throughout his professional career, those values have energized the work that he is committed to achieving. As Chief Development Officer, Paris leads philanthropic strategies for the Children's Learning Centers of Fairfield County (CLC), which is the state's largest center-based early childhood education center.

In addition to his professional career, Paris has been an active participant in politics for nearly a decade, including his most recent role as the Connecticut Young Democrats President.

His leadership as a board member includes serving as the Vice President of Western Connecticut State University's Alumni Association and as a national trainer for Young People For, a People For the American Way program. Today, he is the Vice-Chairman for the Mayor's Multicultural Council for the city of Stamford - a role he was appointed to in 2016 by Mayor David Martin and on the Board of Directors for the Association of Fundraising Professionals of Fairfield County.

Corey P. Paris was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and grew up in Kansas City, Kansas. Paris is an alum of Western Connecticut State University, where he earned a degree in political science.

Paris serves on the legislature's Appropriations Committee as Vice Chair and as a member of the Higher Education & Employment Advancement Committee and Education Committee.
