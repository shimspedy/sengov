First elected in November 2020, Representative Jennifer Leeper is proud to serve the 132nd District. For this Legislative Session, she will serve as Vice Chair of the Education Committee and as a member of the Environment Committee and Human Services Committee.

Jennifer attended Wellesley College, earning her Bachelor’s in Political Science and Religion. She then received her Master’s in Public Policy from the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago.

Representative Leeper is an advocate for education, previously working in the Performance Office at the Connecticut State Department of Education and as a school administrator in New York City. Before being elected to the General Assembly, Jennifer served on Fairfield’s Board of Education, focusing on improving school quality and expanding access to educational opportunities for all students.

As a data analyst, Jennifer strongly believes that data is a critical resource to both find common ground and develop solutions.

Representative Leeper lives in Fairfield with her husband Nick, a principal at RJA Asset Management, raising their two boys together.
