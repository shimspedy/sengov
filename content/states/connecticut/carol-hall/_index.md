State Representative Carol Hall proudly represents the 59th District, serving the towns of Enfield and East Windsor in the Connecticut General Assembly. In her fourth term, Representative Hall will serve on the Judiciary, Public Safety, and Planning and Development Committees. She will also continue in her role as Assistant House Leader after being appointed to the position by Republican Leader Vincent Candelora during the 2021 legislative session.

Raised in a military family, Carol moved around for much of her childhood. Her family eventually planted roots in Enfield when she was in high school and has called it home ever since.

Carol and her husband Fred, a retired Enfield police officer, have raised three children, a daughter Heather and two sons, Zachary and Wes. She and her husband are also the proud grandparents to five grandchildren, a set of twins and a set of triplets. For more than thirty-five years she has been a Realtor for Century 21 AllPoints Realty.

Representative Hallâ€™s willingness to give back to her community began many years ago having served for more than a decade on the Enfield Town Council along with serving on the Enfield Ethics Commission, Enfield Building Committee for the Elementary Schools and Junior High, Enfield Republican Town Committee, General Government Sub-committee for the council and the Insurance Sub-committee for the council.
