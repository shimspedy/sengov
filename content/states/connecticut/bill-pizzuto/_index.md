State Representative Bill Pizzuto was first elected to serve the 71st House District of Middlebury and Waterbury during a February 2022 special election. In November 2022, he was elected to serve his first full term.

For the 2023-2024 session, House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora appointed Rep. Pizzuto to serve as a member of the General Law Committee, Children’s Committee and the Human Services Committee.  Previously, he served on the Banking Committee and the Housing Committee.

A Middlebury resident now, Representative Pizzuto lived in Waterbury for decades and has a long record of service to others in the greater Waterbury community. Whether working as a volunteer on behalf of local boards for NVCC and the Palace Theater, championing local businesses as chair of the Greater Waterbury Chamber, or serving as a Waterbury alderman, Rep. Pizzuto has always kept his community in focus.  Recently retied following a lengthy career as Campus Director for UConn Waterbury, a position he’s proudly held through more than 20 years of transformational changes in education and to downtown Waterbury.

Rep. Pizzuto wanted to serve in the legislature to make our state a more affordable place to live and run a business, and to tackle the growing crime crisis affecting our region and state.  He will continue to work on behalf of the residents of Middlebury and Waterbury and against the high taxes and reckless spending that takes money out of their wallets.
