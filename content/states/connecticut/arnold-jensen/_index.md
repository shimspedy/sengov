State Representative Arnold Jensen proudly represents the 131st Assembly District, covering the town of Oxford and parts of both Naugatuck and Southbury.

For his first term, House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora appointed Representative Jensen to serve on the Energy and Technology, Environment, General Law, and Housing committees during the 2025-2027 legislative session.

Representative Jensen is a fiscal conservative with a proven track record of keeping taxes low on the municipal level, and he plans to continue to push for middle class tax relief for the families and seniors in Oxford, Naugatuck and Southbury, and across the state.

Through the years, Representative Jensen has been a strong supporter of law enforcement and has worked with local police departments to make sure they have the tools needed to keep residents safe.

Representative Jensen graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering and NYU with a certificate in computer programming. Professionally, he recently retired as an engineer for the multinational consumer goods company, Unilever.

Since 2019, he has proudly served as an Oxford Selectman, and has also served as the former Chair of the Oxford Planning and Zoning Commission and the Republican Town Committee. He also previously served as a member of the Oxford Roads commission.

Representative Jensen and his wife Paula have lived in Oxford for more than 23 years and heâ€™s the proud father of two adult children, both of whom graduated from the Oxford school system.
