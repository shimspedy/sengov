Paul Grey Mills Jr., known as Grey Mills, is an American politician who has served as a Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives. He represents the 95th district, which is located in Iredell County. Mills assumed office on January 1, 2021, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Born in Iredell County, North Carolina, Mills is a dedicated public servant with a strong educational background. He earned a B.S. in social science and education from Appalachian State University in 1990 and a J.D. from Regent University School of Law in 1994.

Before his political career, Mills worked as an educator, an assistant district attorney, and a corporate officer/attorney. His political journey began when he defeated incumbent Karen Ray in the 2008 primary. He served for two terms in the NC House from 2009 until 2013.

In 2012, Mills sought the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor but lost to Dan Forest. After then-incumbent Republican John Fraley decided not to seek re-election to the state house in 2020, Mills sought election to his old seat and won.

During his tenure, Mills has been known for his conservative stances. In May 2021, he voted for North Carolina House bill 453, which prohibited abortion based on race, sex, or suspected disability. In March 2021, he voted for House bill 134, which authorized possession of firearms on school grounds.

Mills has also held several committee assignments. In the 2023-2024 session, he served as the Chair of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Committee and the Election Law and Campaign Finance Reform Committee. He was also a member of the Appropriations Committee, the Appropriations on Transportation Committee, the Energy and Public Utilities Committee, the Judiciary I Committee (as Vice Chair), and the House Redistricting Committee.

Grey Mills is not just a politician; he's a family man too. He is married to Jennifer, and they have three children together. Despite his busy schedule, Mills always finds time for his family, showing his commitment to both his personal and professional life.
