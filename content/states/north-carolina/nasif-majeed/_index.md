Nasif Majeed is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Democratic Party. He represents District 99 in the North Carolina House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 1, 2019, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Majeed is passionate about serving people and improving the quality of life for the citizens of District 99. He has a rich history of service, having served in the U.S. Air Force from 1968 to 1973. He is a decorated Vietnam Air Force Combat Pilot and held the rank of Captain and Aircraft Commander of a B-52 Bomber.

In addition to his military service, Majeed has a strong background in business. He was the first African American to build and operate a Burger King franchise in Charlotte. He also worked as a pilot for Piedmont Airlines (now US Airways), and served as a Clinical Chaplain for the North Carolina Department of Corrections for fourteen years. He was a managing partner of Metro-Meck Land Development Company and a custom jewelry maker.

Majeed's commitment to his community is evident in his eight-year tenure on the Charlotte City Council. During his time on the council, he infused over $200 million in infrastructure improvements in his District and spearheaded the successful effort to build the first Regional Recreational Center for East Charlotte. This $40 million state-of-the-art complex is a testament to his dedication to the Eastside community.

Majeed's educational background includes an A.A. in Restaurant Management from the University of Florida in 1979, a B.S. in Business Administration from North Carolina A&T State University in 1968, and an M.S. in Agricultural Education (specializing in animal science) at North Carolina A&T State University in 1979.

He is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 99. The general election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.
