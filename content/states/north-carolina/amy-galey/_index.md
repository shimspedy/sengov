Amy was born and raised in Union Ridge, Alamance County. Her parents are Dr. Sam and Connie Scott. She graduated from Western Alamance High School, UNC Chapel Hill, and the University of North Carolina School of Law.

In her first term as a North Carolina Senator, Amy helped pass the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act.

Some of the appropriations included $15M for an EMS facility for Alamance County, $15.8M for water and sewer projects for Burlington, $800,000 for volunteer fire departments, $541,447 for the Town of Green Level, $2M for the Snow Camp Fire Department, $21M for a water treatment facility in Mebane, $500,000 for water and sewer improvements for Haw River, and $10M for water treatment in Graham.

Amy lives in Union Ridge, on the farm that formerly belonged to her grandparents, with her husband, Fred. They have three children, two dogs, and three cats.
