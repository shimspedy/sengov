Tricia Cotham: A Dedicated Public Servant

Tricia Cotham, born on November 26, 1978, in Charlotte, North Carolina, is an American politician, lobbyist, and former schoolteacher. Her journey in public service has been marked by dedication, advocacy, and a commitment to her constituents. Let's delve into her background, career, and accomplishments.

## Early Years and Education

Tricia earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. Later, she pursued a master's degree in school administration at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Her academic journey laid the foundation for her future endeavors in education and public policy.

## Teaching and Leadership

Before entering politics, Tricia worked as a teacher, assistant principal, and athletic coach in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system. Her experience in education provided valuable insights into the challenges faced by students, teachers, and administrators.

## North Carolina House of Representatives

### First Stint (2007-2017)

In March 2007, Tricia was appointed to represent the 100th district in the North Carolina House of Representatives, filling the seat vacated by Rep. James B. Black. She was subsequently elected to the House in 2008 and re-elected in 2010, 2012, and 2014. During her tenure, Tricia served as co-chair of the House's K-12 Education subcommittee, advocating for quality education and equitable opportunities for all students.

### Advocacy and Personal Courage

In 2015, Tricia delivered a powerful speech on the House floor, revealing her personal experience with abortion. She emphasized that the decision was deeply personal and should be left to individuals, their doctors, and their faith. Her courage in sharing her story highlighted the importance of reproductive rights and sparked conversations across party lines.

### Party Switch and Supermajority

In 2022, Tricia sought to return to the North Carolina House of Representatives. This time, she ran for the House in the 112th district, defeating Republican Tony Long. However, her political journey took an unexpected turn. On April 5, 2023, Tricia formally changed her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, granting the North Carolina House Republicans a supermajority. Her decision sparked both support and controversy, as she had previously campaigned on a traditional Democratic Party platform.

### Current Term (2023-2025)

Tricia assumed office on January 1, 2023, representing District 112. Her current term will end on January 1, 2025. As a legislator, she continues to champion causes such as raising the minimum wage, protecting voting rights, and supporting LGBTQ rights.

- Agriculture Committee
- Education - K-12 Committee (Chair)
- Election Law and Campaign Finance Reform
- Energy and Public Utilities Committee
- Ethics Committee
- House Finance Committee
- Health Committee (Vice Chair)
