Allison Anne Dahle was born on March 25, 1964, in Raleigh, North Carolina. She is a Democratic member of the North Carolina House of Representatives and has represented the 11th district, which includes parts of Wake County, since 2019.

Dahle was born at the old Rex Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina. Her mother, Anne, was a longtime educator at Meredith College, and her father was an agricultural economist at North Carolina State University. She attended Needham B. Broughton High School and graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in Theatre and Speech. After her graduation, she worked as a stage manager on Broadway, and later for the Young Adult Institute in Brooklyn. Later, she worked for the Arc of North Carolina.

Dahle identifies as a lesbian. She is one of four openly LGBT officeholders currently serving in the North Carolina state legislature, alongside caucus colleagues Marcia Morey, Deb Butler, and Cecil Brockman.

After defeating incumbent Duane Hall in the Democratic primary, Dahle was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives on November 6, 2018. She secured sixty-nine percent of the vote while her closest rival Republican Brennan Brooks secured twenty-seven percent. Dahle was re-elected in 2020.

In the 2021-2022 session, Dahle was assigned to the following committees: Appropriations, Appropriations - General Government, Alcoholic Beverage Control, Election Law and Campaign Finance Reform (Vice Chair), Ethics, Local Government - Land Use, Planning, and Development.

Dahle was first elected in 2018, defeating a Democratic incumbent in the primary by a 40-point margin. Outside of the legislature, she has previously worked for nonprofits in the state. Her priorities are equal rights, including for the LGBTQ community, gun safety, and making it easier for North Carolinians to vote.

She believes that North Carolina can be a better and more welcoming place for everyone and is committed to keeping District 11 blue and breaking the Republican majority in the General Assembly.
