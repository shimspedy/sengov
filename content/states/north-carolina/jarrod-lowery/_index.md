Jarrod Lowery is a dedicated public servant and a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, representing District 47. He assumed office on January 1, 2023, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Born and raised in Robeson County, North Carolina, Jarrod is the product of two parents who instilled in him the value of faith, family, and serving others. After graduating from Purnell Swett High School, Jarrod enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps where he served as a tank technician for six years.

In 2012, Jarrod graduated from UNC-Pembroke with a bachelor's in Political Science and a minor in History. A lifelong member of Galilee Baptist Church in Red Springs, NC, Jarrod served as a Sunday School teacher for nearly a decade. As a born-again Christian, Jarrod understands that shining the light that Christ has placed within each us is key to making our communities a better place.

Jarrod is married to his wife, Jennifer, and is the proud step-dad to Bryanna and Jayden. Jarrod and Jennifer welcomed a daughter, Madyson Jade Lowery, in December 2022.

After completing college, Jarrod joined North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory's senior staff. As the governor's Regional Outreach Liaison, Jarrod worked closely with rural communities, veterans, and American Indian leaders. Jarrod worked closely with first responders across North Carolina to address challenges facing law enforcement in rural areas as a senior staffer for North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey in 2017.

A member of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, Jarrod served as an elected member of the Lumbee Tribal Council from 2015-2021, representing the communities of Oxendine, Prospect and Wakulla. As Chairman of the Tribal Council's Federal Recognition Committee, Jarrod advocated for full federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe and helped deliver important legislative victories for the Tribe in the General Assembly. Jarrod also served as chairman of the Tribal Council's Economic Development committee.

In 2022, Jarrod was elected to represent North Carolina's 47th House District in the North Carolina General Assembly by a decisive 22-point margin. In the General Assembly, Jarrod has been a strong advocate for Robeson County communities. Representative Lowery successfully introduced the American Indians Graduating with Honors Act, which now protects American Indian students' ability to wear cultural objects at graduation ceremonies. Lowery has also introduced Kayla's Law to protect domestic abuse victims and empower prosecutors to after criminals, and the Work and Save Act to make it easier for working North Carolinians to save for retirement. Rep. Lowery received the "Jobs Champion" award from the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce for his pro-business voting record, and he played a pivotal role in securing millions in critical funding for Robeson County through the 2023 State Budget, benefiting teachers, law enforcement, UNC-Pembroke, Robeson Community College, and funding various infrastructure projects across the district.
