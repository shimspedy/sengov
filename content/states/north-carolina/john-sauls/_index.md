John Irwin Sauls II, known as John Sauls, is a Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives. He was born on November 29, 1949, in Wilson, North Carolina. Sauls is a pastor from Sanford, North Carolina, and a former Lee County Commissioner. He has represented the 51st district, which includes constituents in Lee and Harnett counties, since 2017.

Before his political career, Sauls had a successful twenty-plus year business career. After retiring from business, he focused on serving his community as both a pastor and community leader. His son, John Sauls III or "Pastor J3", took over Sauls' position as lead pastor at Crossroads Ministries in 2016. Sauls is also a Vietnam-era veteran.

Sauls claimed he was ready to run for commissioner when he was approached by Lee County GOP in 1997 because "God had prepared [him] for it." Sauls won by a close margin to join the NC House in both 2002 and 2004. In 2016, Sauls ran for House District 51 yet again, and flipped the district when he beat Democratic incumbent Brad Salmon.

As of the 2020 Census, North Carolina state representatives represented an average of 87,116 residents. After the 2010 Census, each member represented 79,715 residents. Sauls' current term ends on January 1, 2025. He is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 51. He is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.

Sauls has been assigned to various committees during his tenure. In the 2023-2024 session, he was assigned to the Commerce Committee (Chair), Education - Community Colleges Committee, Energy and Public Utilities Committee, Ethics Committee (Chair), and House Finance Committee.

His legislative office is located at 300 N. Salisbury Street, Rm. 408 Raleigh, NC 27603-5925. His main phone number is 919-775-8033 and his email is John.Sauls@ncleg.gov.
