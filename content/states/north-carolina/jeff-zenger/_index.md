Jeff Zenger is a principled conservative and a member of the Republican Party. He represents District 74 in the North Carolina House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 1, 2021, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025. He is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 74 and is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.

Zenger is a small business owner who has grown his business into a successful company that builds commercial and residential structures across the state. He is a strong believer and previously served as a missionary in the metro Baltimore area for many years. He is a devoted husband and has raised four wonderful children with his wife.

He believes that the role of government should be small, with a focus on local decision making. As a city councilman, Zenger saved taxpayers money by promoting efficiency and privatizing services when possible. As a small businessman, Jeff understands how important it is to plan for the future and stay in healthy financial standing. If elected, he will fight against corruption and wasteful use of our tax dollars.

Zenger believes in the God-given rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and knows that the rights of the individual must come first. That's why he won't let big government overreach to interfere with the lives of everyday North Carolinians. Whether it means protecting the unborn, standing up for second amendment rights, or loosening needless regulations on businesses, you can count on Jeff to hold the line.

North Carolina House of Representatives District 74, which Zenger represents, had an average of 87,116 residents as of the 2020 Census. After the 2010 Census, each member represented 79,715 residents. Members of the North Carolina House of Representatives serve two-year terms and are not subject to term limits. North Carolina legislators assume office on January 1 the year after their election.
