Destin C. Hall is an American attorney and politician who has served in the North Carolina House of Representatives, representing the 87th district since 2017. He was born on July 17, 1987, in Lenoir, North Carolina. He graduated from West Caldwell High School, and went on to earn his bachelor's degree from Appalachian State University, where he double-majored in Finance and Risk Management & Insurance. After his graduation from Appalachian State University in 2009, he earned his J.D. degree from Wake Forest University School of Law. 

After he graduated in 2014, Hall practiced law in Charlotte, North Carolina, for a year before returning to his hometown of Lenoir. Hall currently lives and practices in Lenoir, North Carolina. He is married.

Hall began his political career soon after his return to Caldwell County in 2015 where he became the Treasurer of the Caldwell County Republican Party. In January 2015, the longtime State House Representative Edgar Vance Starnes, who previously held the seat for 20 years, unexpectedly resigned to accept a position with the North Carolina State Treasurer's office. George S. Robinson was appointed to take Starnes's seat in the North Carolina House. 

Hall announced his campaign for the North Carolina House of Representatives 87th District seat on December 1, 2015. In March 2016, Hall won the Republican Party Primary. Hall won the General Election on November 9, 2016. He was sworn in as a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives in January 2017. Shortly after, Hall was elected by his peers to be the Majority Freshman Leader of the House Republican Caucus. In 2018 and 2020, Hall was reelected to his seat in the North Carolina House of Representatives. 

On August, 3rd 2020 Hall was appointed co-chair of the North Carolina House Committee on Rules, Calendar, and Operations of the House by Speaker Tim Moore. Shortly after Hall's appointment, he was raised to full chairman of the committee following the unexpected resignation of the prior chairman, David R. Lewis. After being sworn in for his third term, Hall was once again appointed to serve as chairman of the North Carolina House Committee on Rules, Calendar, and Operations of the House by Speaker Tim Moore for the 2021-2022 Legislative Session.
