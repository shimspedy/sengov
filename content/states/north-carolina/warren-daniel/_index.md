Warren Daniel is a Republican member of the North Carolina State Senate, representing District 46. He assumed office on January 1, 2013. His current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Warren Daniel is a North Carolina native, raised in Burke County'the oldest of four children. In 1986, he received his Eagle Scout award, and in 1987, he graduated from Freedom High School. He was honored to receive a Congressional appointment from former Congressman Cass Ballenger to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. In June 1991, he graduated from West Point with a Bachelor of Science degree in National Security and Public Affairs. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Army Field Artillery and served in the U.S. Army for the next six years in rapid deployment artillery units and also as a university level ROTC assistant professor of military science.

In 1997, he left active duty, transferred to reserve status, and returned to North Carolina to attend UNC Law School at Chapel Hill, where he graduated with honors in 2000. After his graduation from law school, he returned to Morganton, so he could practice law with his father in their family firm. For over 20 years, he has represented hundreds of clients, and argued cases at every level of the North Carolina court system, from the Burke County courthouse to the North Carolina Supreme Court in Raleigh. He was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2007.

In 1993, he married Lydia Furr at the West Point Cadet Chapel, and they have been blessed with three wonderful daughters. As the grandson of a North Carolina tobacco farmer, farming is in his blood. His family spends their weekends and spare time on their family farm repairing fences, cutting wood, and growing a garden. They also enjoy spending time outdoors-hiking, camping, horseback riding and canoeing.

As a small businessman and farm owner, he is accustomed to hard work. He is committed to the ideals of self-discipline, integrity, and professionalism, which he learned while working to become an Eagle Scout, and later as a West Point cadet. During his years at West Point, the principles of Duty, Honor, and Country were instilled in him, and these values are still very much a part of who he is and what he believes. He thanks military veterans and their families for their service. He looks forward to serving the fine people of Burke, McDowell, and Buncombe counties in the North Carolina Senate.
