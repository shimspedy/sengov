Lindsey Prather is a dedicated public servant, educator, and community leader who represents the 115th District of North Carolina in the House of Representatives. She is a member of the Democratic Party and assumed office on January 1, 2023. Her current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Born and raised in Wake County, North Carolina, Prather has lived in Buncombe County for over 16 years. She is a proud product of North Carolina public schools and a recipient of the NC Teaching Fellows scholarship. She attended the University of North Carolina Asheville, where she earned her bachelor’s degree in Sociology and her Social Studies and Special Education teaching licenses.

After graduation, Prather taught for six years in Buncombe County Schools, including Erwin High School and Middle College. Her years of teaching Occupational Skills, US History, and Civics sparked her interest in understanding her students’ experiences outside of the classroom and the mechanisms of how government serves students and communities. This led her to enroll in Western Carolina University’s Masters in Public Affairs program.

Upon completing her master's degree, Prather returned to her alma mater of UNC Asheville to serve as Assistant Director of Admission. In this role, she works to recruit and counsel incoming transfer and military/veteran students, as well as strengthen the relationship and pipeline between NC community colleges and the university.

Prather's dedication to public service extends beyond her professional career. She, her husband Eric, and their dog Maeby are active members of their community in Candler. They enjoy spending their free time taking walks at the local park, riding bikes in and around the county, and admiring Mt. Pisgah.

Prather's commitment to her community and her passion for public service led her to run for office. She believes that Buncombe County and its mountains, their home, deserve a strong voice in Raleigh. Now more than ever, she is determined to ensure that they continue to have that voice.

As a representative, Prather is committed to using her knowledge, experience, work ethic, and privilege to give back to the people who live and work in this beautiful region. She is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 115 and is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.
