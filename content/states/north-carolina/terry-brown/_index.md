Terry M. Brown Jr. is a dedicated public servant and an accomplished litigation attorney based in Charlotte, North Carolina. He is currently serving in his second term as a State Representative, representing North Carolina's 92nd House District. In 2023, he was elected to serve as the House Democratic Whip for the 2023-2024 Session.

Born and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Terry has experienced all that the Tar Heel State has to offer. His parents, both public school educators, instilled in him the values of service, education, and community from a very early age. He watched his parents sacrifice to provide their students the opportunity to succeed, which deeply influenced his own path towards public service.

Terry earned a bachelor's degree from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and a J.D. from Campbell University Law School. Before being elected to the legislature, Terry worked as a political director, campaign manager, and litigator. He has also been a community advocate for affordable housing and justice reforms.

As a legislator, Terry combines his passions for justice, education, and building a robust economy in order to help strengthen North Carolina and improve the lives of the residents of NC House District 92. His focus is on improving North Carolina's education system, investing in infrastructure, increasing access to mental health resources, and strengthening the middle and working class.

Terry has secured significant legislative wins during his tenure. He secured $300,000 to establish CMPD Cares Mental Health Response Team, $10 Million for the Sullenberger Aviation Museum, and millions for the National Institute of Minority Economic Development to support minority and women-owned businesses in the State.

Terry lives in Steele Creek with his wife Arielle, their pet turtle, Terra, and lab-mix, Pharaoh. He continues to serve his community and state with dedication and commitment, striving to make North Carolina a better place for all its residents.
