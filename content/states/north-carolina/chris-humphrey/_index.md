Born and raised in Eastern North Carolina, Chris has always been deeply invested in the community, instilling in him a strong work ethic and a passion for public service from a young age. He even earned the prestigious rank of Eagle Scout, a testament to his dedication and commitment to excellence.

Chris's academic accomplishments include receiving his Associate of Arts degree from Lenoir Community College and his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the prestigious University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Throughout his adult life, Chris has remained active in Eastern North Carolina, serving as a Lenoir County Commissioner for eight years, in addition to his three-year tenure on the La Grange Town Council. Chris has also been actively involved in various local organizations, such as serving as the President of the La Grange Chamber of Commerce and being a member of both Kinston and Goldsboro Kiwanis Clubs and the Goldsboro Civitans. He is a former President of the La Grange Rotary Club and a current member of the Rotary Club of Kinston, where he is also a Rotary Paul Harris Fellow.

Additionally, Governor Pat McCrory appointed him to the Lenoir Community College Board of Trustees, and he has been a member of the Finance Committee for over 15 years. At the start of the 2023 session, Chris was appointed by House Speaker Tim Moore to serve as Chairman of the House Committee on Insurance and Vice Chairman of the Committee on Disaster Recovery & Homeland Security. He was also appointed as a member of the Agriculture, Appropriations, and Health committees.

These appointments are a testament to Chris's exceptional leadership skills and expertise in these areas, as well as his commitment to working tirelessly to improve the lives of North Carolina residents. As a member of the American Flood Coalition, Chris has been instrumental in securing historic investments towards flood resilience in North Carolina, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to protecting his constituents from the devastating impact of natural disasters.

He has sponsored and supported legislation that has brought record amounts of disaster relief funding to Eastern North Carolina, enhanced broadband connectivity to rural areas, supported the Aviation program at Lenoir Community College, provided resources for the NC Global TransPark and ECU Brody School of Medicine, and promoted fiscal conservatism and good governance.

Despite his numerous professional accomplishments, Chris remains dedicated to his family, and he continues to reside in Kinston, NC, with his wife Terry, who is an attorney and is Chair of the Criminal Justice and Social & Behavioral Program at Lenoir Community College.
