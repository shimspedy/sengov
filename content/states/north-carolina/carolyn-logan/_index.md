Carolyn Logan is a dedicated public servant and a trailblazer in many respects. She currently represents District 101 in the North Carolina House of Representatives, a position she has held since January 1, 2019. Her current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Born and raised in Asheville, North Carolina, Carolyn Logan's journey to public service began in 1977 when she joined the Asheville Police Department, becoming the first black female police officer in Asheville. Her dedication and commitment to service led her to be recruited to the North Carolina Highway Patrol in 1984, where she made history again by becoming the first black female trooper in the state of North Carolina.

In 1985, she was transferred to serve Mecklenburg County, and over the years, she was promoted to Sergeant and served Gaston County, and then Union County as a Traffic Safety Specialist. She was the only black female trooper in the state of North Carolina for 14 years. In 2007, she became the first female of any race to retire from the North Carolina Highway Patrol with the required 30-year minimum.

Carolyn Logan studied Criminal Justice at Belmont Abbey and has completed the Administrative Officers Management Program through NC State University. She is also a Certified Basic Law Enforcement Instructor. Her extraordinary service to the state has been recognized with the Order of The Long Leaf Pine from the state of North Carolina. She has also received the Trailblazer Award from the Black Women’s Caucus, and the Pioneer Award from North Carolina State Law Enforcement Officers Association.

She has served three terms as the president of the Black Women’s Caucus of Charlotte Mecklenburg and previously served as a member and as vice chair of the Mecklenburg County Commissioners’ Criminal Justice Advisory Committee. She is a member of the Black Political Caucus in Charlotte as well as a member of the Charlotte Women’s March and was a guest speaker at the march in Charlotte in January 2018. She also currently represents the North Carolina State Troopers on The National Board of State Directors of The American Association of State Troopers.

Carolyn Logan is the mother of three wonderful children, Christopher, Morgan, and Taelor. She won her first race for House District 101 in 2018 after the retirement of Rep. Beverly Earle. Throughout her tenure, Rep. Logan has continually worked for her district, advocating for Medicaid Expansion, teacher’s raises, increasing the COLA rates for retirees, raising the minimum wage, and tightening legislation so that there would not be misreadings of possible new laws.

She is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 101 and is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.
