Gale Adcock is a dedicated public servant who currently serves as a Senator in the North Carolina General Assembly, representing District 16 in Wake County. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

Born and raised in a small town in southwestern Virginia, Gale understands the value of hard work and the opportunities that come from education. Her mother worked swing-shift in a local textile mill from high school graduation to retirement. Gale attended local public schools, played flute in the high school band, worked for minimum wage at the local public library, and volunteered as a Candystriper at her hometown community hospital.

Gale has a nursing diploma from Virginia Baptist Hospital, a Bachelor's degree in nursing from East Carolina University (ECU), and a Master of Science in Nursing from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill). She has been a nurse practitioner since 1987 and was Chief Health Officer at SAS Institute for more than 26 years before retiring in October 2020.

Throughout her career, Gale has held numerous leadership positions. She has been president of the North Carolina Nurses Association, chair of the North Carolina Center for Nursing, and a member of the North Carolina Board of Nursing. She served on the board of the Taylor Family YMCA in Cary and on the state Diabetes Advisory Council. She is an adjunct faculty member at Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill, East Carolina, Wake Forest University, and Case Western Reserve University.

Prior to her 2014 election to the legislature, Gale was a gubernatorial appointee to the Legislative Study Commission on Access to Health Insurance and to the Blue-Ribbon Task Force on the State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees. She was appointed and served 4 years on the State Health Coordinating Council responsible for creating the annual State Medical Facilities Plan.

Before joining the state Senate in 2023, Gale served 4 terms in the NC House. She is the first nurse ever elected to the North Carolina Senate. Known as a commonsense legislator, Gale works effectively with members of both parties. Prior to serving in the NC General Assembly, Gale served on the Cary Town Council from 2007-2014, including 3 years as mayor pro tem.

Gale and her husband Kevin live in Cary. Gale has a solid track record of service in business, government, her profession, and her community. She continues to serve North Carolina with dedication and commitment, bringing a reasoned, thoughtful, nonpartisan, and common-sense approach to the challenges that will determine our state's future.
