Cynthia J. Ball is an American politician and a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives. A Democrat, she was first elected in 2016 and then re-elected in 2018, 2020, and 2022 to represent the 49th district, which represents Wake County.

Cynthia was born in Franklin County, where her parents instilled in her the importance of family, hard work, and public education. She graduated as valedictorian of her public school in Franklinton, and then went on to UNC-Greensboro on a full academic scholarship, earning a BA in Psychology, magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. Cynthia also earned an MBA at Virginia Commonwealth University and pursued extensive doctoral coursework in Human Resources and Organizational Development at NC State University.

After working in marketing research following her MBA, she joined William Peace University (formerly Peace College) and then NC State University, directing their Development and External Affairs programs. She is currently serving her fourth term and seeking her fifth term in the 2024 election in the North Carolina State House.

Throughout her tenure, Cynthia has been committed to providing responsive constituent services and to finding common ground on policies to benefit the residents of House District 49 and all of North Carolina. She has sponsored or co-sponsored 213 pieces of legislation, serving as Primary Sponsor on 32 bills of which she is the Lead Primary sponsor on 13. These bills focus on improving the funding for public education, building the teacher pipeline, improving the community responses to mental health crises, protecting the vote and democracy, and improving mental health and healthcare services in our schools.

Cynthia has served in key House Leadership roles since her first term - In her first term as Freshman Democratic Chair; in her second term as Democratic Whip; and in her third as Co-Chair of the House Democratic Caucus Campaign and Vice Chair of Education Appropriations Shadow Committee. Currently, she serves in one of the four senior Caucus leadership positions as Democratic Conference Chair, leading the Caucus programs to elect more House Democrats.

Among many recognitions of her work, Rep. Ball was named Representative of the Year in 2022 by the NC League of Conservation Voters, after previously being recognized in her second term as one of their Rising Stars. These distinctions recognize her strong environmental voting record and her leadership within the House Democrats to advocate for policies that protect the future of our state and its natural resources.
