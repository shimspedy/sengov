Larry Strickland is a member of the Republican Party and represents District 28 in the North Carolina House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 1, 2017, and his current term ends on January 1, 2025. Strickland is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 28. He is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.

Born in 1955, Larry was born and raised in Johnston County. Larry was raised on a tobacco farm in the Brogden community, and for the past 30 years has been a resident of Pine Level. Wanting to give back to his home county, Larry has been an active member of the community for decades.

Before his tenure in the House of Representatives, Strickland served on the Johnston County Schools Board of Education in an at-large position. His commitment to public service and his community is evident in his work both in and out of office.

In his role as a representative, Strickland has been assigned to several committees. In the 2023-2024 session, he served on the Agriculture Committee, the Appropriations Committee (as Chair), the Appropriations on Agriculture and Natural and Economic Resources Committee (as Vice Chair), the Commerce Committee, the Education - K-12 Committee, and the Energy and Public Utilities Committee.

Strickland's professional background includes working as a Real Estate Appraiser and Farmer. His experiences in these fields have undoubtedly informed his legislative work, particularly in areas related to agriculture and economic resources.

Strickland's dedication to his district and the state of North Carolina is clear in his legislative record and his ongoing commitment to serving his constituents. As he continues his work in the North Carolina House of Representatives, Strickland remains a steadfast representative for District 28.
