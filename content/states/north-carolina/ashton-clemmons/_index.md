Ashton Wheeler Clemmons, born on September 2, 1983, is a Democratic member of the North Carolina House of Representatives. She has been representing the 57th district, which includes constituents in north-central Guilford County, since 2019. She has also served as the Deputy Minority Leader since 2023.

Born in Alamance County, Ashton has always had a passion for serving the people of the state she proudly calls home. After graduating from UNC-Chapel Hill as a North Carolina Teaching Fellow, she taught school in Durham and Guilford counties. She went on to earn her Master's in School Leadership from Harvard University and most recently, received her Doctorate of Education from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

Her commitment to education led her to serve as principal of schools in Rockingham and Guilford counties, where she led the turnaround of one of the state's lowest performing schools. While serving as assistant superintendent of the Thomasville City Schools, she was selected one of the Triad Business Journal's "40 Leaders under 40" and has also been honored by the United Way with its Human Rights Advocate award.

She was re-elected to serve in North Carolina's 57th House District on November 3, 2020 and sworn into office on January 13, 2021. During her time in Raleigh, she has been appointed to the Commerce, Education K-12, Education-Community Colleges, Finance, and Marine Resources and Aqua Culture Committees. She also serves as founder and Co-Chair of the Early Childhood Caucus.

As the mother of three young children, Ashton is an energetic and passionate advocate for better schools and job training programs, as well as policies that protect our health care, environment and voting rights. She lives in Greensboro with her husband Bryan Clemmons.

Ashton is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 57. She is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024. The Democratic primary for this office on March 5, 2024, was canceled.
