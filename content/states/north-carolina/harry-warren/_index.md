Harry Joseph Warren was born on May 31, 1950, in East Liverpool, Ohio. He graduated from Kent State University in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in Political Science. In 1969, he married the former Beverly Rizer. They were married for 20 years and had 4 children together. He is currently married to Catherine Warren. He has six children in total.

Warren is a Human Resource Specialist by profession and a member of the Republican Party. He has represented the 76th district (and the preceding 77th district) which includes constituents in Rowan County, North Carolina, since 2011.

He has served in the North Carolina House of Representatives since 2019 and his current term ends on January 1, 2025. Warren is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 76. He is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.

During his service to District 76, he has had the privilege of drafting, sponsoring and co-sponsoring some of the most historic legislation in the state's history. He was the primary sponsor of the 2013 Voter ID bill (V.I.V.A.), requiring a photo id for in-person voting. He was the primary sponsor of the Unemployment Reform bill that repaid a $2.85 billion debt to the federal government, 5 years ahead of schedule, saving state employers hundreds of millions of dollars and putting people back to work. Additionally, he was the primary sponsor of HB 36 E-Verify, requiring employers to check the legal status of their new hires, to protect jobs for the citizens.

Warren believes that government should adhere to its constitutional mandate. Government should be as large as necessary to fulfill its constitutional obligations but never large enough to be obtrusive to our personal freedoms or challenging to our civil or constitutional rights. He is committed to ensuring the state remains true to the course set for its economic and social growth. This course is based on sound conservative principles that promise a bright future for the children and for future generations.

As of the 2020 Census, North Carolina state representatives represented an average of 87,116 residents. After the 2010 Census, each member represented 79,715 residents. North Carolina legislators assume office on January 1 the year after their election.
