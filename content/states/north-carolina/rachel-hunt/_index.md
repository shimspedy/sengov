Rachel Hunt is a member of the North Carolina State Senate, representing District 42. She assumed office on January 1, 2023. Her current term ends on January 1, 2025. Hunt is a Democrat and was elected in November 2022 to represent the 42nd district based in Mecklenburg County.

Prior to her tenure in the Senate, Hunt served two terms in the North Carolina House of Representatives, twice defeating Republican Bill Brawley. She represented the 103rd district from January 1, 2019, to January 1, 2023. 

Hunt is the daughter of former governor Jim Hunt and his wife Carolyn. An attorney and certified college counselor, she is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of South Carolina School of Law. 

In her legislative career, Hunt was first elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 2018, after defeating the incumbent Republican William M. Brawley. The 2018 race was decided by only 68 votes after being one of the most expensive legislative races in the state that year. Hunt was re-elected in 2020 by 9.86% in a rematch against Brawley. 

In 2022, Hunt was elected to the North Carolina Senate to replace Jeff Jackson who vacated the seat to run for the United States Senate. On November 8, 2022, Hunt defeated Cheryl Russo in the race to represent the 42nd State district. 

Despite serving in the minority, Hunt helped pass several pieces of bipartisan legislation including clean energy legislation to cut carbon emissions by 70%. Hunt has also co-sponsored bills to codify Roe v. Wade and expand Medicaid. 

Hunt is a mother of two children, and is married to Olav Nilender, a physician. She is the Democratic Nominee in the 2024 North Carolina lieutenant gubernatorial election.
