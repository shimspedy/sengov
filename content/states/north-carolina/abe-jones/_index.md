He attended Wake County Public Schools and was the first black student council member at Enloe High School.

Jones received his formal education from Harvard College and Harvard Law School. After graduating from Harvard University in 1974 and earning his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1977, he returned to North Carolina.
