Allen Buansi is an American politician who serves as a Democratic member for the 56th district of the North Carolina House of Representatives. He assumed office on June 1, 2022.

Buansi attended Dartmouth College, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 2009. He then attended the University of North Carolina School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 2015.

Before his political career, Buansi served as the Policy and Field Director on Josh Stein's successful campaign for Attorney General. He has also worked in North Carolina's Department of Justice as an attorney, providing support for the Attorney General's initiatives addressing the opioid abuse crisis. He practiced law at the UNC Center for Civil Rights.

Buansi served on the Chapel Hill town council from 2017 to 2021. In May 2022, Buansi narrowly won the Democratic primary for the 56th district of the North Carolina House of Representatives in a race to succeed retiring Rep. Verla Insko. With Buansi facing no general election challengers, Insko resigned from the legislature before the expiration of her term, allowing Buansi to be appointed to her seat and begin his service in the legislature on June 1, 2022.

The 56th district that Buansi represents is located in Orange County. As of the 2023-2024 session, Buansi is a freshman co-chair in the House. His legislative office is located at 300 N. Salisbury Street, Rm. 514, Raleigh, NC 27603-5925. He is an attorney by profession.
