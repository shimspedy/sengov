Brenden Jones is an American politician and entrepreneur from the state of North Carolina. He is a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives from the Republican Party, representing the 46th district. He was first elected in November 2016.

Jones has participated in the 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020 general elections for NC House of Representatives District 46. After losing his first election, the NC Republican Party infused his 2016 campaign with nearly $149K to help him win the seat in the rural 46th District. Before the election, Jones became involved in a physical altercation with his opponent, Tim Benton, and they filed assault charges against each other. The charges were dismissed after the election.

In 2017, Jones introduced HB562, a bathroom bill which would make it harder for transgender people to use public bathrooms by imposing harsher penalties for "trespassing". This was 4 days after partial repeal of the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act. He is opposed to allowing men and women to share public restrooms and changing facilities.

In 2022, Jones ran unopposed in the election. Jones has voiced his opposition to COVID-19 vaccine mandates, even for healthcare systems in NC. He voted to end federal unemployment benefits linked to the COVID-19 pandemic relief for workers.

Jones is a Columbus County native and graduate of Waccamaw Academy in Whiteville. He has been married to his high school sweetheart, Angela, for over 20 years. They live in Tabor City with their two daughters. Brenden has owned and operated small businesses in Columbus County for over 15 years.

He is currently serving as the House Deputy Majority Leader. His legislative office is located at 16 West Jones Street, Rm. 1227 Raleigh, NC 27601-1096. His main phone number is 919-733-5821 and his email is Brenden.Jones@ncleg.gov. His legislative assistant is James Williams.
