DeAndrea Salvador is a Democratic member of the North Carolina Senate. She has represented the 39th Senate district since 2021. She is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Renewable Energy Transition Initiative (RETI), a nonprofit that educates communities and leaders about energy conservation and affordability. She was a 2018 TED Fellow.

Salvador is the fifth generation of her family to live in Charlotte, North Carolina. She became concerned about energy poverty during her undergraduate studies. She studied economics, with a minor in anthropology, at University of North Carolina at Charlotte. She graduated in 2013. She was part of the Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity: a co-educational fraternity which offered her networking opportunities in the energy sector. She wanted to learn more about sustainability and energy, and completed a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certificate from the U.S. Green Building Council.

In 2014 she founded Renewable Energy Transition Initiative (RETI), a nonprofit that educates low-income people about renewable energy. Their mission is to sustainably decrease the amount of people's income that they spend on energy. In North Carolina, many families spend more than 20% of their income on energy expenses. In 2016 she was named as a Charlotte-Mecklenburg BLACK CHAMBER of Commerce (CMBCC) 30 Under 30. Salvador was announced as a TED Fellow in January 2018. She was announced as the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Alumni of the Year in 2018. SouthPark magazine announced her as a "Woman to Watch" in 2018. RETI has run a series of educational activities with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Girl Scouts of the USA, churches, neighbourhood organisations and community centres.

The Grist 50 named Salvador an 'emerging leader on climate, equity, and sustainability' for her involvement in negotiating HB 951 Energy Solutions for North Carolina. She is on the Board of Advisors of Clean Air Carolina, a statewide initiative to improve air quality in North Carolina. Additionally, she works in the data privacy industry and is a Certified Information Privacy Professional as recognized by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).

Salvador served on the Mecklenburg County Air Quality Commission for three years. Her current term ends on January 1, 2025. Salvador is running for re-election to the North Carolina State Senate to represent District 39. She is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.
