Born in China, Ya Liu moved to the Triangle area in North Carolina in 2003 to pursue higher education and better opportunities. Despite arriving with no money, no connections, and limited English proficiency, she has since earned two doctoral degrees in sociology and law.

She was the first Asian American to be elected to the Cary Town Council and is the first and only Chinese American woman to have served in the North Carolina General Assembly.

As a House Representative, Ya Liu hopes to continue to make North Carolina a better state for everyone. She is a strong advocate for business prosperity, careful infrastructure growth, public transit, senior services, and environmentally friendly policies. As a representative in the General Assembly, she continues to fight for improved schools, better healthcare, a stronger economy, cleaner environments, and policies that will improve the lives of working families to prepare the state for the future.

Ya Liu's life has been a testament to the power of the American Dream. She is proud to show that everyone can achieve success and prosperity with hard work and determination. By working hard every day, she plans on making a better, brighter, and greener future for everyone in her district and all over North Carolina.
