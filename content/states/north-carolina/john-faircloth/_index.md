John Faircloth is a Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives. He has been representing the 62nd district since 2019. Prior to this, he represented the 61st district from 2011 to 2019. The 62nd district covers parts of western Guilford County.

John Faircloth was born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina. He was raised by his grandparents, Earl and Clara Preddy, who were the parents of the well-known WWII Mustang Fighter pilots, Major George Preddy and 1st Lt. Bill Preddy. Major Preddy was the leading ace among all Mustang pilots in WWII and was best known for one particular mission. He was leading his squadron in escorting American bombers over enemy territory. John Faircloth's heroes as he grew up were his two uncles, both of whom lost their lives in combat only a few months before the end of World War II.

John attended public schools and graduated from Greensboro Senior High School (now Grimsley High School). He married his high school sweetheart, Linda Rich, immediately before his service in the military. Days after he and his wife eloped, he joined the U.S. Army where he trained as a Military Policeman and served as a Public Safety NCO in a Civil Affairs Company with a combined total of 16 years active and reserve service. John and his late wife have three daughters, Tammy, Laura and Catherine, and three grandchildren.

John wanted to attend college but the need to find a job was more pressing as a young married soon-to-be father. His experience in military law enforcement training earned him a position as a Foot Patrolman for the Greensboro Police Department. As he gained specialized experience and expertise in the field, moved up through the ranks to become the Commander of the Vice & Narcotics Division. While working full time, Officer Faircloth took advantage of a newly funded federal program to encourage police officers to attend college. He attended Guilford College, alternating day and evening classes depending on his duty hours, and graduated with an Associate Degree in Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Management and a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice.

Upon completion of college and eleven years of police service with Greensboro, John was encouraged to apply for a newly created position in state government. He was appointed as the first Director of the Criminal Justice Education and Training Standards Commission in the Department of Justice. He moved to Raleigh and began assembling a staff and developing a program. The first major challenge was locating and granting 'grandfather certification' to every legally appointed and sworn in state, county and municipal law enforcement officer in North Carolina. Within 18 months the groundwork for the new commission was in place and new standards for hiring and retention were approved.

John Faircloth has served actively, honorably and productively for five terms representing the great citizens of Guilford County, first in District 61 and more recently in District 62. His efforts on behalf of his constituents have been centered on Appropriations, Justice & Public Safety, Judiciary and State & Local Government.
