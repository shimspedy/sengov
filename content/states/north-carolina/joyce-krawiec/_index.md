Joyce Krawiec serves in the North Carolina Senate. She represents communities including Winston-Salem, Walkertown, Kernersville, Mocksville, Kernersville, Clemmons, Advance, Belews Creek, and Bermuda Run. She is known for her compassion and her ability to work with others. She passed a bill to require health insurance companies to cover children with autism with near unanimous support. She also passed Burt's Law to crack down on abusive nursing home staff. She also passed a Voter ID bill to protect election security.

Joyce never expected to run for office. But when Representative Larry Brown passed away she was shocked when members of the Republican Party wanted to appoint her to the seat. Soon after, Senator Pete Brunstetter left office to go into private practice and Party members again urged her to accept an appointment. She was sworn into office in early 2014 and re-elected in her own right.

Before serving in the Senate, Joyce was a lifelong conservative and Christian activist. She lives in Kernersville with her husband Ray. They have lived in the community for over forty years. They own a commercial real estate development firm and have two grown daughters. They attend First Christian Church.
