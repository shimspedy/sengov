Born in Kingston, New York, Crutchfield has lived in the North Carolina Piedmont for nearly half a century. He is a staunch conservative and the grandson of a Kentucky Coal miner and a service station owner. He aspires to earn election to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 2022.

Crutchfield graduated from Owego Free Academy in 1978. He earned an associate degree from Broome Community College in 1981 and a computer science equivalency from the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. He also became a certified purchasing manager and received his general contractor license, his electrical contracting license, and underwriter laboratories (UL) manufacturing certification.

Crutchfield's career experience includes working as an electronic technician engineer, purchasing agent, and software developer for IBM Corporation, a national sales manager for Cabarrus Plastics, the vice president of operations for Rite Lite Signs, president and CEO of the Crutchfield Group, and president and chief financial officer of Casco Signs.

After winning a seat in the NC House in 2022, he quickly found success in the General Assembly. He was elected by his colleagues as the Freshman Majority Leader, founded and co-chairs the House Small Business Caucus, introduced legislation to reduce government overreach, and helped secure over $185 million in appropriations for his district.

As of the 2020 Census, North Carolina state representatives represented an average of 87,116 residents. After the 2010 Census, each member represented 79,715 residents.
