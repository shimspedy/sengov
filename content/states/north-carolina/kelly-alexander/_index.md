Since my election in November of 2008, I have had the privilege of serving the people of North Carolina as a member of key legislative committees: Energy & Energy Efficiency; Environment & Natural Resources; Finance; Juvenile Justice; Public Utilities; Water Resources & Infrastructure (Vice Chair); House Select Committee on Small Business; Ways & Means/Broadband Connectivity. Additionally, I have been appointed by the Speaker to serve on the Legislative Study Commission on Urban Growth & Infrastructure Issues; the House Select Committee on High Speed Internet Access in Rural & Urban Areas; Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight Committee and the Joint Legislative Finance Committee. My colleagues elected me as co-chair of the House Democratic Freshman Caucus.

District 107 embraces neighborhoods as diverse as those along Beatties Ford Road, Old Statesville Road, Mallard Creek Church and Prosperity Church Roads, and the Fourth Ward. At its heart you can find commercial centers of the NC Music Factory entertainment district, Mallard Creek, and Northlake. Historic Charlotte runs through the entire district, and is home to families from all walks of life, many who have lived here for generations. The district's diversity is its strength.

In my tenure, I have kept the people of District 107 informed about legislation and important executive branch initiatives with a weekly newsletter highlighting legislation on important topics including transportation and support for small business. In a series of town hall-style meetings in the district, we have hosted State of North Carolina officials like former Secretary of Commerce J. Keith Crisco answering the questions of concerned citizens about state programs designed to assist businesses both large and small. 

I pledge to continue working with you to maintain the district's high level of economic activity. The district's health rests upon the availability of employment opportunities and upon a quality of life that brings amenities - shopping, entertainment, recreation, education, public facilities - close to our neighborhoods. I am committed to our District. I am committed to you. With your vote, I can return to Raleigh and continue bringing my brand of "Forward Thinking Leadership" into the policy deliberations of the General Assembly. Together, we can make a difference.
### ABOUT
I have worked for most of my life in the areas of civil rights, community organization and small business. Along with my brother, Alfred, I manage the Alexander Funeral Home, Inc. Established by our grandfather in 1914, it is the oldest African American-owned business in Mecklenburg County. I have taught classes at West Charlotte and Harding High Schools, Central Piedmont Community College, Johnson C. Smith University, Queens University, and UNCC. I have passionately served in various positions with the NAACP including my twelve years of service on the National Board of Directors as the North Carolina NAACP President. My personal goals for my home town and North Carolina have provided me with many unique opportunities to serve on committees and boards at the local, state, national and international levels. I am an avid reader of both history and science fiction. I have done radio commentaries, produced a television variety show (Experience) and radio music program (Talk to the People); radio commentaries (Metrolina Viewpoint), written op-ed columns (Charlotte News, Charlotte Observer, and Charlotte Post), poetry... and one of these days, I will write that book.

### ISSUES
In Raleigh, I am continuing the conversation and submitting legislation on the issues that affect you directly.

#### JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
The most important challenges facing us today are jobs and economic development. Our state needs to promote policies that attract new investment and promote growth of existing companies. We need to develop a comprehensive package of programs and policies that will focus on supporting small businesses who are struggling with technical assistance and access to capital. The state needs to actively pursue policies that assist NC businesses as they adapt to the evolving energy renaissance in the United States.

#### EDUCATION 
North Carolina's students must be encouraged to pursue and master the biological and physical sciences, mathematics, engineering, and reading. We must think globally in order to execute locally, creating jobs by developing new products and processes. We must embrace education as a lifelong enterprise, and allow out-of-date Industrial Age distinctions between secondary education, community college and university to be replaced by institutions which support our abilities to learn and adapt well beyond our 20s. To effectively train 21st century students we must be prepared to individualize instruction and utilize the amazing technological tools at our disposal.

#### REGIONAL VISION 
Charlotte is the hub of a multi-county region. The challenges and promise of our region go beyond city/county boundaries. Increasingly we must look for regional solutions to challenges in transportation, environmental stewardship, resource management, energy, economic development, and planning. All of these issues pose challenges in coordination, funding, and governance. The state of North Carolina, in partnership with local governments, must take the lead in defining this new 21st century regionalism.

#### CARROTS NOT STICKS 
I believe that the State should provide incentives for individuals and business to adopt policies and practices that improve water and energy efficiency. The State should promote the lowering of water/sewer, electrical rates for consumers who reduce their consumption; provide incentives for construction and renovations that meet or exceed green building council standards, use renewable energy, recycle water, plant climate appropriate ornamental vegetation. Each of these choices opens up new business opportunities, creates jobs and helps keep our economy healthy.
