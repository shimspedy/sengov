Willingham ran for a full term in the new 24th district (the geographic successor to the 70th district) in 2002, but lost the primary to Jean Farmer-Butterfield who went on to win the general election. Willingham unsuccessfully challenged state senator Clark Jenkins in the 2004, 2006, and 2008 primaries. Willingham then served 2 terms on the Edgecombe County School Board.

Willingham returned to the NC House in 2015, after being elected in 2014 to the 23rd district. Since his initial election in 2014, Willingham has been re-elected to the NC House a total of 4 times, most recently in 2022.

Members of the North Carolina House of Representatives serve two-year terms and are not subject to term limits. North Carolina legislators assume office on January 1 the year after their election.

Willingham's current term ends on January 1, 2025. He is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 23. He is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024. He advanced from the Democratic primary on March 5, 2024.
