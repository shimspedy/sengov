Senator Paul A. Lowe, Jr. is a Democrat representing District 32 in the North Carolina State Senate. He assumed office on January 30, 2015. His current term ends on January 1, 2025. He is running for re-election to the North Carolina State Senate to represent District 32 and is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.

Paul Lowe is a descendant from a long line of clergy members and is a member of the clergy himself. The biblical phrase, 'Do Justice, Love Mercy and Walk Humbly' has served as a guide for Senator Lowe, reminding him every step of the way to do the most good. For Paul, service to community has always been first, from the pulpit of the historic Shiloh Baptist Church in Winston Salem, where he has been a pastor for over two decades, to the chamber of the North Carolina Senate.

Paul believes that our best days lay ahead of us, that we can turn back the clock of time and undo the damage inflicted on this State by one party domination. Lowe was appointed to fill out the term of Senator Earline Parmon in 2015 and wasted no time to get to work. Within the first few days of his legislative career, Senator Lowe began to focus on the economic needs of his community in Forsyth County and the State of North Carolina.

He introduced several bills to revive tax credits including historic preservation and film production as well as numerous pieces of legislation to show that North Carolina is open for business and job creation. His legislative committee assignments include: Appropriations/ Base Budget, Appropriations on Health and Human Services, Commerce and Insurance, Committee on Finance, Rules and Operations of the Senate.

Senator Paul Lowe is married to the former LaGail Crews, a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. He is a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, a 33rd degree mason and is involved in various other civic and fraternal organizations. He has served as a delegate to the 2008, 2012 & 2016 Democratic Conventions, was an adjunct professor at Shaw University Divinity School and is a leader and a member of the General Baptist Convention of North Carolina and National Baptist convention USA Inc.

Senator Lowe is happy to have previously served as Chairman of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus (NCLBC). In this position he hopes to fight for economic equality, educational justice and a healthcare system that works for all North Carolinians.
