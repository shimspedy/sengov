Mary Gardner Belk, born on October 5, 1956, is a Democratic member of the North Carolina General Assembly. She represents the state's 88th House district, which includes portions of Southeast Mecklenburg County. She assumed office on January 1, 2017.

Belk lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. She and her husband, Ralph Belk Jr., have four adult children. Her oldest son, Ralph Belk III, serves as her legislative assistant. 

Belk graduated from Garinger High School in 1974 and studied police science before dedicating time to raising her children. She later returned to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and earned her BA in political science, graduating with honors in 2006.

Before seeking elective office, Belk served on a number of community Boards, including the Dilworth Community Development Association, the Charlotte Catholic Foundation, the St. Patrick's Church Council, and the Democratic Women of Mecklenburg County. 

In September 2016, during her first campaign, Belk was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent surgery to immediately begin treatment. A positive prognosis allowed her to postpone chemotherapy until two days after the 2016 election, and she underwent radiation treatments during her first months serving in the General Assembly. Her office announced that she completed her final radiation treatment on May 18, 2017.

In the 2023-2024 session, Belk was assigned to the following committees: Appropriations Committee, Appropriations on Transportation Committee, Environment Committee, Regulatory Reform Committee, and House Transportation Committee.

Belk is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 88. She is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.
