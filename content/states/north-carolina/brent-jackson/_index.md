Senator Brent Jackson is a Republican member of the North Carolina Senate, representing the 9th district, which includes Jones, Duplin, Pender, Bladen, and Sampson counties. He assumed office on January 1, 2011, succeeding Charles Albertson.

Born on November 8, 1957, in Clinton, North Carolina, US, Brent Jackson resides in Autryville, North Carolina. He has served seven terms in the Senate and has not served in the House.

In addition to his political career, Jackson is also a businessman. He is the founder of Jackson Farming Company, an agricultural business that grows a variety of crops including watermelons, cantaloupes, honeydews, strawberries, pumpkins, squash, slicer cucumbers, sweet potatoes, corn, wheat, soybeans, peanuts, and flue-cured tobacco. Jackson owns two country grain elevators for the purpose of purchasing and storing corn, small grains, and wheat from his farm and area farmers. In 2005, he expanded and built a liquid fertilizer plant, which supplies his farms and area farmers with drip fertilizer.

In the North Carolina Senate, Jackson is co-chairman of the Senate Appropriations/Base Budget Committee, and the immediate past co-chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Natural and Economic Resources and the Senate Agriculture/Environment/Natural Resources Committee. He is also co-chairman of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, Joint Agriculture and Forestry Awareness Study Commission and the Agriculture and Rural Caucus of the North Carolina General Assembly. Additionally, Jackson sits on the Senate Finance Committee, Rules and Operations of the Senate Committee, and Senate State and Local Government Committee. In 2014, he was elected to the Legislative Board of the international organization, State Agriculture and Rural Leaders.

In 2015, Jackson authored an ag-gag bill subsequently made law after the legislature overrode a veto by Governor Pat McCrory. The bill allows for prosecution of individuals who go undercover to expose animal cruelty and other illegal activity in the North Carolina factory animal farming industries.

In May 2019, a building owned by Jackson Farming Company suffered significant fire damage and was destroyed.

In terms of electoral history, in the 2022 North Carolina Senate 9th district general election, Jackson won with 100% of the votes. In the 2020 North Carolina Senate 10th district general election, Jackson won with 65.09% of the votes against Democratic Vernon R. Moore. In the 2018 North Carolina Senate 10th district general election, Jackson won with 62.46% of the votes against Democratic Vernon R. Moore.
