Bobby Hanig, also known as Robert Otho Hanig, is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He is currently serving as a member of the North Carolina Senate, representing District 3. He assumed office on January 1, 2023.

Born in 1963 or 1964, Hanig is a self-made small business owner who founded two small businesses. He grew a one-man operation into a business that services roughly 400 properties in the Outer Banks area. Prior to his service in the General Assembly, Hanig was the Chairman of the Currituck County Commission.

Hanig's political career began when he was encouraged to run for office in 2016, specifically for Currituck County Commissioner. He was elected and chosen as Chair of the County Commission. During his tenure as county commissioner, Hanig expressed his dislike for solar farms in Currituck County, by saying "large solar projects haven't been a good deal for Currituck County residents". He voted in 2017 to ban all future solar facility development.

In 2019, Hanig was first elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives after defeating incumbent Beverly Boswell in the primary election for House District 6. He served in this position until August 29, 2022.

On his campaign Facebook account, Hanig expressed his dislike for the Affordable Care Act. He also states that he is pro-life and a supporter of HB2. He was endorsed by the NRA and posted about it on his campaign Facebook page.

In 2022, Hanig was appointed by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper to serve the remainder of Senator Bob Steinburg's term representing District 1 following Sen. Steinburg's resignation to seek the Republican nomination in Senate District 2. Hanig represents state Senate District 1, which is composed of Camden, Chowan, Currituck, Dare, Gates, Hertford, Hyde, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrrell, and Washington Counties. He then switched to represent District 3 in the North Carolina Senate from 2023 onwards.

Hanig is an Army veteran and owns The Pool Guy Aquatic Services. After serving in the U.S. Army, Hanig moved to the Outer Banks and serviced rental properties. A few years later he started his own pool business and created a property management business.

Hanig is running for re-election to the North Carolina State Senate to represent District 1. He is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.
