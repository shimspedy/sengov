Representative Dean Arp is a member of the Republican Party and has been serving in the North Carolina General Assembly since 2013. He represents District 69, which includes constituents in Northwestern Union County. His current term ends on January 1, 2025.

Born on July 7, 1966, Representative Arp's values of sacrifice and service were instilled early in his life by his family, especially his grandfather who served in World War II. He earned a Civil Engineering degree from The Citadel, the storied Military College of South Carolina, where he was elected by his peers to serve on the Honor Court. Despite an accident that prevented him from pursuing a life of military service, the training he received was invaluable.

As an award-winning Company Commander at The Citadel, Representative Arp led his company of over 110 men to receive the President's Cup and claim the title of Honor Company. The President's Cup is presented annually to the cadet company with the highest combined score in academic achievement, military performance, extracurricular participation, fourth-class retention, and the fewest disciplinary cases.

Upon graduation, Representative Arp received the George W. Walker White Award for outstanding achievement in Civil Engineering. He is a small business owner and president of Arp Engineering in Monroe, where he is a licensed professional engineer and structural engineer licensed in forty different states. He received his Master of Science degree in Civil Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte where he also serves on the Advisory Board for the William States Lee College of Engineering.

Under his leadership on the Board of Education for over twelve years, Union County Public Schools was the most successful large school district in North Carolina. Representative Arp has also volunteered for the H.E.L.P. Crisis Pregnancy Center, Habitat for Humanity, and Operation Reach Out, an organization in Monroe to help those less fortunate. He also volunteers extensively at his church where he has been both a teacher and a deacon. He also helped build a school in Africa.

Representative Arp was elected to a fifth term in the state House in 2020, garnering nearly two-thirds of the vote in his north Union County district. He currently serves as Senior Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and Chairman of the Energy and Public Utilities Committee. He is also Co-Chair of the Joint Legislative Committee on Energy Policy, Co-Chair of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Capital Improvements, and a member of the House Select Committee on Advancing Women in STEM and several other standing and non-standing committees.
