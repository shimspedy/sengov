Allen Chesser II is a Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, representing District 25. He assumed office on January 1, 2023. His current term ends on January 1, 2025. Chesser is running for re-election to the North Carolina House of Representatives to represent District 25. He is on the ballot in the general election on November 5, 2024.

Allen Chesser has always been willing to serve the people of North Carolina. After he saw our country being attacked on 9/11, he felt called to do something and joined the military at 17 years old. Allen deployed to Iraq with B. Bttry. 5/113 Field Artillery from 2005-2006, where he completed over 100 combat missions as a turret gunner. Allen is proud to have represented our country as a defender of freedom and is honored to have had the opportunity to serve this great nation.

During his time in service, Allen served alongside men and women from all walks of life, and he exemplified the principles of Duty, Honor, and Respect, which we should desire in all of our elected representatives. After returning from Iraq, Allen continued serving his community as a police officer with the Town of Nags Head and the City of Raleigh. As a police officer, Allen learned to work within the community to address their problems and concerns. Keeping people safe and their property secure became a passion for Allen.

Allen married his wife, Jessica, in 2009, and together, they live in the Samaria community of Nash County with their five wonderful children. The Chessers are raising their children to be focused on God and service to others. Allen and Jessica have devoted themselves to serving other; founding a local non-profit and a christian soccer league that allows all the children to play for free.

Allen first got involved in local politics in 2009. Allen has served in various leadership positions within the Republican party (including County Executive and District Executive Committees, as well as County Public Relations Director) and has helped on numerous local campaigns. Before serving in the North Carolina House, Allen was the State Chairman for the North Carolina Republican Liberty Caucus.

Since being sworn in as our Representative, Allen has worked to bring all stakeholders together to work on good policy and governance for all. During his first term, Allen championed multiple pieces of legislation, including the Loving Homes Act, a bill to increase access to good homes for children in the foster care system, that was unanimously passed by the General Assembly and signed into law by the Governor. In the 2023 State Budget, Allen secured over $55 Million in appropriations for Nash County'a record-setting amount of funding for our community.
