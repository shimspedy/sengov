Graig R. Meyer, born on July 5, 1974, is an American politician serving as a Democratic member of the North Carolina Senate. He represents the 23rd district, which includes all of Orange, Caswell, and Person counties, since 2023. 

Before his tenure in the Senate, he served as a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, where he was elected to the 50th district seat 4 times. In 2022, Meyer announced his candidacy for District 23 of the North Carolina Senate, and was elected to that seat in November 2022.

Meyer, the son of two politically engaged social workers, was raised in the inner city of Cleveland, Ohio. He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the College of Wooster, before going on to acquire a master's degree in social work from the University of Chicago.

Prior to joining the House, Sen. Meyer spent sixteen years working in public schools working primarily on initiatives designed to promote educational equity. From 1998 through 2014, he was the coordinator of the Blue Ribbon Mentor-Advocate program. From 2012 through 2014, he also served as the Director of Student Equity for the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools.

In 2018, Meyer co-authored More Than a Mentoring Program. The book offers real-world perspective and advice on challenging systemic racism in schools. When then-Rep. Valerie Foushee was appointed to the Senate in 2013, Meyer was selected by a local Democratic Party committee to hold the rest of her term. He was reelected in 2014 and 2016, running against Rod Chaney in both elections. He won a 2022 primary election for N.C. Senate with 84% of the vote.

During his time in the legislature, Meyer has established himself as a strong advocate for improving public education. In addition, he has worked as the founding Co-Chair of two bipartisan legislative caucuses, the Early Childhood Caucus and the Life Sciences Caucus. He has been recognized by both the League of Conservation Voters and the Young Democrats of North Carolina for his legislative leadership.

Meyer also works as a co-founder and principal consultant with The Equity Collaborative, LLC.
