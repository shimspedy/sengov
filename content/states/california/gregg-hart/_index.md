Assemblymember Gregg Hart was elected to the California State Assembly in November of 2022 to represent the 37th Assembly District. With a deep understanding of local people and local issues, he is proud to have served the Santa Barbara community for more than 30 years – as a Planning Commissioner, City Council Member, California Coastal Commissioner, and Santa Barbara County Supervisor.

Dedication to public service came naturally to Assemblymember Hart, as he was inspired by his parents. They spent their lives working for the community: his mother worked as an elementary school teacher and his father was the Library Director for the City and County of Santa Barbara.

Assemblymember Hart began his professional career as a Legislative Assistant for former State Assemblymember Jack O'Connell and went on to become the original manager of the Santa Barbara County Association of Government’s (SBCAG) Traffic Solutions program. There, he promoted local green and sustainable transportation options. Later, his expertise in this arena led him to serve as the Deputy Executive Director for SBCAG, supporting regional efforts to widen the 101 freeway and improve bus and passenger rail service throughout Santa Barbara County.

Growing up in Santa Barbara, Hart attended local public schools, then graduated from Santa Barbara City College and the University of California, Santa Barbara. For more than twenty years, he owned and operated Transitions Preschool, a local, family business dedicated to early childhood education and quality childcare.

With a long history of fighting to increase educational opportunities, reduce poverty, prepare for emergencies, and support the health and safety of the people of California's Central Coast, Assemblymember Hart will put the needs of Santa Barbara County and southern San Luis Obispo County front and center in Sacramento.
