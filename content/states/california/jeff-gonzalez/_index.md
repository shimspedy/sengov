Jeff Gonzalez is a combat veteran, small business owner, pastor, community leader, and father.

A first-generation American, Jeff’s dream was to serve our country. After graduating high school, Jeff enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, where his service took him overseas to combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. Jeff also completed multiple missions protecting U.S. embassies in Honduras and the Czech Republic.

After two decades of service, Jeff retired from the Marine Corps and became a local pastor. Motivated by the tragic loss of ten fellow Marines to suicide, he felt a calling to serve as a Pastor to protect those most vulnerable.

Day to day, Jeff Gonzalez is a small business owner, community volunteer, and father to a son diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Whether it’s trying to sort through the red tape to keep his business afloat or navigating the intricacies of the healthcare system to ensure top-quality care for his son, Jeff has witnessed California at both its best and worst. He knows what California is capable of, and most importantly, he has the know-how to fix it. Jeff’s mission in Sacramento is clear: to increase access to healthcare, lower the cost of living, and fix a broken California.

Jeff is married to his wife, Christine, and his family includes four children: RJ (31), Lexi (28), Zack (22), and Mike (17). Together, they reside in Indio.
