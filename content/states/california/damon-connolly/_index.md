Assemblymember Damon Connolly was elected to the California State Assembly in November of 2022 to represent the 12th Assembly District.

Over his nearly two decades in public service, Damon Connolly has been a capable and effective leader who is thoughtful, dedicated, and focused on achieving important policy victories that improve the lives of all North Bay residents.

Damon has been fighting for North Bay communities for 18 years, as a Marin County Supervisor, Vice-Mayor of San Rafael, School Board President, and California Deputy Attorney General.

As a Marin County Supervisor, he protected open spaces while increasing the availability of affordable housing; set Marin County on a path toward 100 percent renewable energy while keeping the County’s fiscal house in order; and spearheaded responses to homelessness while expanding access to public transit and infrastructure for bicyclists and pedestrians.

Prior to serving on the Board of Supervisors, Damon served as the Vice Mayor of San Rafael, a two-term San Rafael City Councilmember, and former School Board President. He was a founding board member of Marin Clean Energy (MCE) and served as Chair of the Board of Directors from June 2011 to November 2014.

Before opening his own law practice in San Rafael, Damon was a Supervising Deputy California Attorney General, prosecuting the energy companies that gouged our state during the energy crisis of 2000-2001.

Damon has served as the President of the Workforce Alliance of the North Bay. He was also a Member of the Marin County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, Marin County Housing Authority, and Marin County Open Space District. Damon also served as Marin County’s representative on the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.

As a State Assemblymember, he serves as Vice-Chair of the Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policy, Chair of the Select-Committee on Wildfire Prevention, Chair of the Joint Committee on Fairs Allocation and Classification, and is a member of the following policy committees: Utilities and Energy, Judiciary, Budget, Budget Subcommittee No.3 on Climate Crisis, Resources, Energy, and Transportation, and Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials.

Damon is a Bay Area native, attending college and law school at UC Berkeley. He has lived in San Rafael with his wife and their two daughters for twenty-five years.
