Ochoa Bogh is a graduate of San Bernardino High School and the University of California, Santa Barbara. She worked towards her teaching credential at California State University, San Bernardino and went on to teach English language learners at the elementary school level. She has been a proud Realtor for over 20 years, helping others achieve the American Dream. Ochoa Bogh served on the Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School District board and is a former board Chairwoman/President of the Yucaipa Valley Chamber of Commerce as well as a former board member of the East Valley Association of Realtors.

In November 2020, Ochoa Bogh made history as the first Republican Latina elected to the California State Senate, representing nearly one million residents in Senate District 23. In November 2024, she was re-elected to serve a second term, now representing the newly drawn 19th Senate District, which encompasses cities and communities across Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The 19th Senate District is the 3rd largest California Senate District encompassing 40 cities and communities.

She has been appointed Vice Chair of the committees on Education; Human Services; Energy, Utilities and Communications. She is also a member of the committees on Budget and Fiscal Review; Governmental Organization; Housing; Joint Legislative Budget and Budget Subcommittee #1 on Education.

Throughout her career, Ochoa Bogh has been a champion for stronger schools, lower taxes, better infrastructure, and more affordable home prices. In the State Senate, she has worked to lower the cost of living in California, support a strong economic recovery, preserve local control, and reverse the cycle of higher taxes and increased government intrusion.

Senator Ochoa Bogh and her husband of 28 years, Greg Bogh, live together in the city of Yucaipa with their Cocker Spaniel named Penny. They are proud parents of three wonderful children, a son and two daughters.
