On November 8, 2022, California State Assemblyman Josh Hoover was elected to represent the 7th Assembly District in Sacramento County. Assembly District 7 includes the cities of Citrus Heights, Folsom, and Rancho Cordova and the unincorporated communities of Carmichael, Fair Oaks, Foothill Farms, Gold River, Mather, McClellan Park, North Highlands, Orangevale, and Rosemont.

Josh is a passionate advocate for California families. His top priorities include making sure our community remains a great place to live, work, and go to school. He serves as the Vice Chair of the Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economic Development, and the Economy where he works to support small businesses and bring great jobs to our region. He is also a member of the California Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of legislators committed to finding common sense solutions to our state’s biggest challenges.

Josh also serves on the Assembly Select Committee on Serving Students with Disabilities. As the father of a child on the autism spectrum, he cares deeply about the integration and outcomes of kids with special needs. For his work advocating for students, he was named Folsom’s Young Professional of the Year in 2020.

Prior to his election to the Assembly, Josh served as a school board member in the Folsom Cordova Unified School District (FCUSD). He led the fight to reopen schools in his community, and as a result, FCUSD was the first district in Sacramento County to bring students back for in-person instruction. He also worked to balance the budget, protect taxpayers, expand mental health services, support school police officers, and improve student achievement.

Josh earned a bachelor’s degree in political science and public policy from UCLA and a master’s degree in public administration from USC. He lives in Folsom with his wife Nicole and their three children Ayden, Addison, and Austin.
