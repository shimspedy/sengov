Protect California’s first-in-the-nation ban on assault weapons;
End pay-to-play political contributions to local elected officials;
Enact a truth-in-lending disclosure requirement for small business loans, making California the first state in the nation to protect small businesses from predatory lending practices;
Increase the 4-year graduation rate for the 470,000 students attending California State University from 19% in 2015 to 40% by 2025;
Provide tax incentives to expand water conservation accomplished through the passage of Proposition 87 on the statewide ballot.

During his tenure in the Senate, he has served as the Chair of 6 Senate Committees, including: Elections and Constitutional Amendment Committee; Select Committee on Student Success; Banking & Financial Institutions; Governmental Organization; Insurance; and Business, Professions & Economic Development.

He was re-elected in November, 2020 with 66 percent of the vote. He previously served for ten years as an Orinda City Council member, including three terms as Mayor.

 A former senior advisor to California’s Governor, Jerry Brown, Senator Glazer worked with Gov. Brown to help return California to solid financial footing in the midst of the Great Recession. He also served as a California State University Trustee, working on limiting tuition increases and lowering administrative costs at the 23 CSU campuses.

Senator Glazer earned his bachelor’s degree from San Diego State University where he served as Student Body President.
