Anamarie Ávila Farías proudly represents California’s 15th Assembly District, which includes parts of Contra Costa County and the East Bay. A lifelong public servant and advocate for working families, Ávila Farías brings decades of experience in affordable housing, economic development, and educational equity to her role in the State Assembly.

As the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants who came to the United States through the Bracero Program, Ávila Farías’s personal story reflects the resilience and contributions of immigrant communities. Raised by a single mother after her father’s passing, she overcame significant socioeconomic challenges, inspiring her lifelong commitment to addressing poverty and inequities. These experiences drive her dedication to policies that support housing security, workforce development, and family well-being.

Ávila Farías’s leadership spans local, county, and state levels. She made history in 2012 as the first Latina elected to the Martinez City Council and later served on the Contra Costa County Board of Education. Her accomplishments include launching affordable housing programs, championing accessory dwelling units (ADUs) for multi-generational housing, and creating green housing developments that transform environmental threats into sustainable solutions. She also spearheaded workforce initiatives, such as pre-apprenticeship programs for at-risk and incarcerated youth.

Appointed by both Governor Brown and Governor Newsom to the California Housing Finance Agency Board, Ávila Farías has been a leading voice for housing equity, creating programs like the Building Black Wealth campaign to increase Black homeownership and an ADU grant program to expand housing opportunities. A dedicated advocate for education and youth empowerment, she continues to serve on nonprofit boards supporting environmental education and juvenile justice reform.

A proud third-generation Contra Costa County resident, Ávila Farías earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of San Francisco, becoming one of the first in her family to earn an advanced degree. She lives in Martinez with her husband, an architect, and their two children.
