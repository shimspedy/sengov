Assemblymember Mark González was first elected to the California State Assembly in November 2024 and appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly to serve as Majority Whip.

González represents the 54th Assembly District — one of the most diverse districts in California. District 54 encompasses Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights, Westlake, Downtown Los Angeles, Koreatown, Pico-Union, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Historic Filipinotown, and the cities of Vernon, Montebello, and Commerce.

González is the son of a single mother and grew up in Section 8 housing — he understands the challenges working families face in trying to make ends meet. After his mother suffered a stroke two years ago, Mark became her sole caregiver — taking his mom to the grocery store, doctor appointments, and attending church with her every Sunday. In this role, he witnessed the failures of government, social programs, and the healthcare system to support vulnerable seniors adequately.

Prior to his election to the State Assembly, Mark served as Chair of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party. He successfully organized support for laws to make community college free, protect our air and water, make housing more affordable, and combat the homelessness crisis.

After the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Mark helped lead the fight to pass a constitutional amendment in California protecting a person's right to access safe, legal abortion care — effectively turning California into a safe haven for anyone seeking reproductive care across the nation. In 2023, Mark organized to pass a new law ensuring all healthcare workers receive a minimum wage of $25/hour.

The challenges he and his family faced are at the core of his advocacy, driving him to stand up for his community and work toward ensuring that no Californian has to endure such struggles.
