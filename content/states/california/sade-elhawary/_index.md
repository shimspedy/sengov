Assemblymember Sade Elhawary is an educator, organizer, and advocate for social justice who represents the 57th Assembly District, including the communities of Exposition Park, South Los Angeles, and Downtown Los Angeles.

Born and raised in Los Angeles, the Assemblymember is the eldest daughter of Egyptian and Guatemalan immigrants who came to the United States seeking a brighter future. At Community Coalition for over 12 years, Elhawary was mentored by Mayor Karen Bass and City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson and served as a youth organizer recruiting and developing future leaders of the social justice movement. Her achievements include helping establish the Fremont High School Wellness Center to reduce health disparities in a medically underserved neighborhood and securing the School Climate Bill of Rights to reduce racial profiling in schools.

Elhawary played a pivotal role in founding the Nelson Mandela School for Social Justice, shaping its curriculum and first graduating class. Her work reflects her deep commitment to improving outcomes for women and young people of color while fostering Black/Brown solidarity.

Assemblymember Elhawary holds a bachelor’s degree from UCLA and a master’s from Harvard Graduate School of Education. She shares a home in South Los Angeles with her foster daughter Makailah.
