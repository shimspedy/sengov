Assemblymember Juan Carrillo was elected to the California State Assembly in November of 2022 to represent the 39th Assembly District. He will represent portions of the northern Antelope Valley, including Palmdale, Lancaster, the eastern communities of Littlerock, Lake Los Angeles, and Sun Village, stretching into San Bernardino County to include Adelanto, Hesperia, Mountain View Acres and Victorville.

Assemblymember Carrillo served as a member of the Palmdale City Council, advocating for affordable housing to address the homelessness crisis, increasing green space, and supporting local small businesses as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Before entering public office, Carrillo served as a city planner for 15 years — 10 of which were with the City of Palmdale.

Juan was born and raised in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, and immigrated to Los Angeles when he was 15. He earned his Associate’s Degree in Architecture from the College of the Desert, Bachelor’s Degree in Urban and Regional Planning from California State Polytechnic University Pomona, and a Master’s Degree in Public Administration from California State University Northridge. Juan lives with his wife in east Palmdale with their four children.
