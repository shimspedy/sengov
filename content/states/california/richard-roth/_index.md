Richard Dale Roth was born November 6, 1950, in Columbus, Ohio and graduated from Ada High School (Ada, Ohio) in 1968, where he played in the band and was elected president of his junior class and the Student Council. He went on to Miami University (Ohio), majored in political science, minored in chemistry and enlisted in the ROTC program.
