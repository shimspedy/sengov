Assemblymember José Luis Solache, Jr. was first elected to the California State Assembly in November 2024 representing the cities and communities of Lakewood, Lynwood, Maywood, Paramount, South Gate, Huntington Park, Bellflower and Walnut Park.

Solache has served as a Mayor, Mayor Pro-Tem and Councilmember in the city of Lynwood since 2013. In this role, he's worked to recruit new job-creating employers to the city, build new parks, make City Hall more transparent and expand youth programs.

Prior to his service in city government, José served for three terms on the Lynwood Unified School District’s Board of Education. The district educates over 15,000 local students and José served as Board President three times. His election to the school board at the age of 23 made him one of the youngest elected leaders in L.A. County.

Solache was born in Bellflower, grew up in Lynwood and attended local public schools. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Liberal Studies from California State University, Dominguez Hills. While pursuing his undergraduate degree, he served two terms as Student Body President. He also served as statewide Chair of the California State Student Association (CSSA).
