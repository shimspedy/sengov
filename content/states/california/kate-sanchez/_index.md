Kate Sanchez was elected to the California State Assembly in November, 2022 and now serves the 71st California Assembly District.  Kate is a proud Mom, business woman and has been a proven advocate for parental rights, public safety and continues to fight against California tax increases.

Kate has worked for numerous lawmakers and began her career working for the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee with former Congressman Ed Royce.  Kate was a member of the California Policy Center which explored nonpartisan, common-sense education reform and solutions to California’s public school issues.

As a working mother, Kate feels that every child deserves access to a quality education and their zip code shouldn’t dictate a child’s opportunities.  Kate was the former Executive Director of the California Women’s Leadership Association (CWLA) and is also a proud graduate of the Marian Bergeson Excellence in Public Services Series. She earned a B.A. with a concentration in Political Science/Law from Salve Regina University.

Kate’s family has lived in the 71st Assembly District for over 30 years.  Her assembly office will cover the cities of Mission Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita, Temecula, Murrieta, Wildomar and unincorporated areas of French Valley, Temecula Wine Country and Orange County.
