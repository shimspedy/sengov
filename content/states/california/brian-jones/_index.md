Brian was born on a Bergstorm Air Force Base in Austin, TX. His family made just enough to make ends meet and moved around often. Brian’s parents saw an opportunity to provide a better life for their family in California’s construction industry. When Brian was ten-years-old, his family moved from a small trailer on the plains of Colorado to their dream town, Santee in San Diego County. He attended Santee Elementary, Cajon Park Middle School, and Santana High School. Motivated by his parents’ dedication to providing more opportunities for their children, Brian graduated from Grossmont College. He then earned his bachelor’s degree in Business Administration at San Diego State University.

Brian worked tirelessly his entire life. Brian joined his father in working on the assembly line for a door and trim company at the young age of twelve. Brian worked at a local pizza franchise throughout college and eventually moved into the franchise’s management program. After college, he pursued many career paths, including launching his own carpet cleaning business and selling cars and motorcycles. Driven by his devotion to his faith community, Brian became a pastor and a general manager for a national ministry headquartered in Santee. Seeing the challenges the faith community experienced with California’s bureaucracy, Brian transitioned into commercial real estate, where he assisted churches with navigating through land-use issues.

Brian met his wife Heather while working at the local pizza franchise.  They have been married since 1992 and currently live in Santee. They enjoy spending time with their three adult children Christopher, Matthew, Melina, and her husband, Justin. In his free time, Brian loves anything outdoors; he is an avid mountain biker, adventure motorcyclist, occasional hunter/angler, and is always trying to find time to explore State Parks in California.

Brian’s Dedication to Public Service

Determined to improve the quality of life in his community, Brian first found his passion for public service as a Santee City Council Member from 2002-2010 and then again from 2017-2018. Brian took this passion for his community to the state level when he was elected to represent California's 77th Assembly District from 2010-2012 and California's 71st Assembly District from 2012-2016. In 2018, Brian was elected to represent California’s 38th Senate District.

In 2022, Brian was elected to represent California’s 40th Senate District. Brian is proud to serve as the Senate Minority Leader for the California Senate Republican Caucus. Brian’s platform focuses on Fixing California—reducing the cost of living, acting on homelessness, tackling rising crime, and restoring educational excellence. Additionally, coming from a military family, Brian is a fearless supporter of our Armed Forces and our veterans.
