Assemblymember Rodriguez was elected to serve in the California State Assembly in 2013 representing the 53rd Assembly District, which includes the cities of Pomona, Ontario, Chino, Upland, and Montclair. Born and raised in the City of Pomona, Freddie has dedicated his life to serving his community. For over 30 years he worked as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) in the San Gabriel Valley and was first elected to the Assembly during a 2013 Special Election.

As an EMT, Assemblymember Rodriguez was awarded the California Star of Life award for his outstanding community volunteer contributions and lifesaving rescues. In 2005, he traveled to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to help the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In 2014, Rodriguez was named EMT of the Year by the California Emergency Medical Services Authority.

As a former Pomona City Councilmember, Rodriguez successfully fought to improve public safety, expand Neighborhood Watch programs, help develop the Rio Rancho Towne Center, create new jobs through economic development projects he championed, and deliver balanced budgets while protecting city services during tough economic times. He led the effort to restore public safety positions in Pomona.

A leader in helping jumpstart the local economy, Rodriguez brought together community and business leaders to help revitalize downtown Pomona, generate new economic investment, and create new jobs.

Since joining the State Assembly, Rodriguez has worked hard to improve working conditions for emergency responders, school safety, local transportation needs, and more. As an advocate for the Inland Empire, he has been instrumental in State investment into the community, championing funding for affordable housing, reduction in homelessness, and new green spaces.

He lives in Pomona with his wife Michelle. They have four children, Desirae, Freddie Jr., Vincent, and Selena; and three grandchildren.
