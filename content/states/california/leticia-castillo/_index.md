Leticia graduated locally from Buena Vista Vocational Educational High School while Simultaneously completing the cosmetology program at Corona College of Cosmetology in 1989. She also holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Services from University of Phoenix and a Master of Arts degree in Counseling Psychology with a dual specialization in Marriage and Family Therapy and Professional Clinical Counseling from National University.

Leticia's professional background includes working as a Licensed Clinical Psychotherapist for the County of Riverside Department of Mental Health where she worked with families, children, and adults who were facing severe mental health challenges, as well as substance use, legal, and homeless issues. Leticia was able to see firsthand how the continued mishandling of the COVID-19 emergency powers created an increase of mental health challenges for both children and adults many who were already suffering from severe mental health to those who experienced their first mental health challenges during the extended shutdowns. Now, Leticia owns a private practice where she continues to serve the needs of those in her community.

California is at its breaking point. Many of OUR friends, family, and neighbors have already left the state. Our once safe communities are now filled with crime, drug use, and homelessness. Criminals are set free while law abiding citizens pay the price of the failed soft on crime policies in Sacramento. I want to change that by supporting stronger measures to reduce crime and homelessness and strengthen our law enforcement agencies because we all deserve to feel safe in our communities.

As a mother and grandmother, Leticia is pro-school choice, and pro-parental rights, and stands firm on parents knowing what is best for their children, not the government. Leticia also understands the high cost of living challenges that California families are facing. Leticia, wants a better future for all California families. 

Leticia is pro-Second Amendment and believes Californians have a right to protect and defend themselves. She vehemently supports our military, which includes her brother a Marine Veteran, a nephew who served in the Air Force Reserves, and one who serves in the Navy to this day.

Leticia is a first generation Mexican-American and the youngest of six siblings who is fluent in both English and Spanish, as her parents are immigrants from Mexico. Her Dad came to the United States legally through the farm laborer (braceros) program and achieved the American Dream through his faith in God and strong work ethics; he believed that America is the Land of Opportunity and that we all have the same opportunities to determine our own future. From his love of God and our country, he instilled in her the same beliefs and values.
