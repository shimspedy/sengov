Megan and her husband are dry land wheat farmers. The wheat that they grow is processed for seed, which is sold to local farmers and wholesalers alike. As a part of their business, she runs the trucking division to transport grain across the state. Their farm has full-time employees, which has given Megan significant insight into the difficulty of running a business in our state. Meganâ€™s experience as a small business owner and entrepreneur has helped her to understand the challenges and obstacles to owning and operating a business in the Golden State. As a small business owner, Megan is responsible for compliance, human resources, and finances, even as the burden of over-regulation has increased the cost of doing business in California.

Until 2012, Megan was a co-owner of Big Valley Nursery in Bieber.

Megan served as President of the Big Valley Joint Unified School Board for one term, where she grew her passion for rural education. She advocated for, and continues to support, access to Advanced Placement and enrichment classes so that every student can achieve their full academic potential.
