Assemblywoman Laurie Davies represents the 74th Assembly District, which includes the communities of southern Orange County, including Dana Point, Laguna Niguel, San Clemente, and San Juan Capistrano plus the communities of northern San Diego County, including Camp Pendleton, Oceanside and Vista.

Laurie Davies is a small business owner and former Mayor who was elected to the State Assembly in 2020, and re-elected in 2022.
Laurie serves on the Assemblyâ€™s committees for: Military (Vice Chair), Accountability, Transportation, Communications and Conveyance, Governmental Organization and Water, Parks & Wildlife.

Like so many, Laurie packed up everything and headed west in pursuit of the California Dream. Originally from Wisconsin, after graduating from high school and saving enough money to buy a Cutlass Supreme, Laurie moved to Southern California to attend Cal State Long Beach.

After earning her degree, Laurie planted roots in Orange County where she worked locally in the Restaurant and Hospitality sector. Two decades ago, she launched a small business specializing in wedding and special events that she successfully still operates today.

Over the course of nearly the last twenty years as an entrepreneur and small business owner, Laurie became active in the community. In recognition of her involvement in the community, she was awarded the Melvin Jones Fellowship Award from the Lions Club.

Laurie was first elected in 2012 to the Laguna Niguel City Council in 2012. She was appointed Mayor in 2015 and re-elected in 2016. During her time on the Council, Laurie served as a Board Member on the Transportation Corridor Agency, Chaired the League of Cities Committee on Transportation, Communication and Public Works, and was elected to the OCTA. Laurie served the Board of the Association of California Cities Orange County as President.

Laurie lives in Laguna Niguel with her husband, Neil.
