Heath Flora is a farmer, firefighter and business owner with the kind of real world experience desperately needed in the State Assembly. He was raised on a farm and has been a small business owner and volunteer firefighter for over fifteen years.

A life-long farmer, Heath serves as a Director for International Sales at the Exact Corporation, a family-owned business that manufactures innovative products for both nut harvesting and forcible entry equipment for firefighting. Heath also owns Golden Valley Equipment which sells used agricultural equipment. Prior to entering the business world, Heath received training as a paramedic and worked for CAL FIRE for three summers.

Having served as a volunteer firefighter for over fifteen years, Heath worked his way up the ranks — serving as firefighter, engineer, Captain and now as Battalion Chief. As a regional director for Sons of the Flag, Heath is working to bring together community leaders, pioneering physicians, experienced military service members, and dedicated first responders to advance care and treatment of long-term burn victims.

Through his church, Heath did extensive volunteer work in Cambodia where he helped build churches and English schools.

While serving in the Legislature, Heath has fought for improved public safety in California, as well as working to ensure hard-working farmers have a voice at the table. More specifically, Heath’s legislation has established a statewide firefighter apprenticeship program, provided greater access to individuals’ vital records, and set safety standards pertaining to electric motorized scooters. As the Minority Floor Leader, Heath ensures fairness and justness in the legislative process in the Assembly. Serving as the Vice Chairman of the Committees on Natural Resources and Labor & Employment as well as sitting on the Agriculture, Rules and Business & Professions committees, Heath is able to provide fresh perspectives to policy debates and the legislation related to these areas.
