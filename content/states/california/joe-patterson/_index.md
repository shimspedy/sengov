Joe Patterson was elected to the State Assembly in 2022 to be the voice for Placer and El Dorado County residents at the State Capitol.  Prior to being elected to the legislature, Joe served on the Rocklin City Council and as Mayor in 2019.

Born and raised in Napa, Joe is a life-long Californian who moved to the region in 2000.  Joe and his wife, Colleen, have four young children (Ethan, Andi, Graham and Blake).

He attended Sacramento State and was admitted to the post-graduate Jesse M. Unruh Assembly Fellowship where he began his career working in the state Legislature.  After several years as a legislative staffer, Joe left the state Capitol for the private sector.  In 2019, Joe launched his own small business where he worked with businesses and associations on regulatory and legal matters.

In his free time, he enjoys running on trails throughout the district, staying fit with his men’s workout group (F3), and spending time in Tahoe with his family.  He plans to continue coaching his kids’ little league teams and being the loudest cheerleader dad in the stands.
