Assemblywoman Lori D. Wilson was elected in April 2022 to represent California’s 11th Assembly District which includes all of Solano County and portions of Contra Costa and Sacramento Counties. The District includes the Cities of: Benicia, Dixon, Fairfield, Oakley, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville and Vallejo.

Prior to her election to the Assembly, Lori Wilson was the first Black female Mayor to serve in the entire history of Solano County. First elected to the Suisun City Council in 2012, she served as Vice-Mayor for six years before winning the Mayor’s race in 2018. During her tenure, Lori demonstrated a track record of fiscal responsibility while leading efforts to bring more housing, jobs and diversity to Suisun City.

After being elected to the California State Assembly in April of 2022, Assemblywoman Wilson hit the ground running. During this first year and a half, Assemblywoman Wilson has already sent 11 bills to the Governor’s Desk and delivered millions of dollars in state funding directly to the 11th District. From housing to electric vehicle infrastructure to flood resiliency to transportation and public safety improvements, these funds will improve the quality of life in Contra Costa, Sacramento and Solano Counties.

In addition to being an effective and results-oriented legislator, Assemblywoman Wilson’s tenure in the Assembly has also resulted in multiple historic moments. First, Assemblywoman Wilson is the only Black woman in California history to be appointed Chair of the influential Assembly Transportation Committee. Dating back to 1954, the Transportation Committee oversees California’s transportation infrastructure, networks and state agencies tasked with delivering California a safe and efficient transportation system.

Second, Assemblywoman Wilson is the first legislator in the history of California to be elected Chair of the California Legislative Black Caucus as a freshman. The California Legislative Black Caucus was formed in 1967 when African American members of the California Legislature joined together to address the legislative concerns of African Americans and other citizens of color. Under her leadership, the Caucus has shattered previous records delivering hundreds of scholarships to students of color while also enjoying numerous legislative and budget wins.

Finally, Assemblywoman Wilson is the first legislator in the history of California to openly discuss being the parent of a transgender child. In today’s heated political climate, it is crucial that this community has representation in Sacramento and Assemblywoman Wilson has demonstrated her commitment to defending vulnerable communities.

Assemblywoman Wilson’s track record in the California State Assembly includes delivering policies that create good jobs, keep the community safe and improve the quality of life for her constituents and the people of California. Lori is focused on bringing state services directly to individuals, local businesses, veterans, non-profits, and local governments who need help interacting with government agencies, like the Employment Development Department.

Lori is a graduate of California State University, Sacramento with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Accountancy. Her diverse career history, including more than 20 years in Accounting & Finance, has afforded Lori tremendous opportunities to hone her skills in government and nonprofit management, strategic development and budget administration.

A native Californian raised on the west side of Fresno, Lori is married to her high school sweetheart Chavares Wilson, a retired Air Force Reserve Technical Sergeant. They have been blessed with two sons, Tyler and Kiren, a daughter-in-law, Brittney, and a grandson, Weston. They have enjoyed living in Suisun City since 2004 after being stationed at Travis AFB for 5 years.
