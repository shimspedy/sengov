Assemblymember Carlos Villapudua was born and raised in Stockton, and received his bachelorâ€™s degree from California State University, Sacramento. Prior to being elected to the State Assembly in 2020, he served on the San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors for eight years. He spent this time fighting to keep the doors open at the County General Hospital to save healthcare in the County, and expanding both the Stockton Metropolitan Airport and the Port of Stockton. This work helped attract employers to the local area to create good paying jobs for local families.

After serving on the Board of Supervisors, Assemblymember Villapudua worked as the CEO of the San Joaquin County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to support minority-owned small businesses locally and in Sacramento. He also served as the Governmental Relations Manager for Western Pacific Truck School, where he worked to increase funding for vocational education and provided jobs that can support an entire household.

Assemblymember Villapudua is married to his wife, Edith, and has a blended family of four daughters.
