Carl DeMaio has represented California’s 75th Assembly District since 2024. Before joining the Assembly, DeMaio had a successful business and radio career and served on the San Diego City Council from 2008-2012. After losing both of his parents at the age of 14, DeMaio worked to put himself through Georgetown and later founded two successful companies before the age of thirty. A lifelong, dedicated reformer and taxpayer advocate in California, DeMaio aims to give a voice to the voiceless — and hold state government accountable.
