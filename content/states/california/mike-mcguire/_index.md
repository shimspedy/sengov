Mike McGuire was born on July 21, 1979, in Healdsburg, California. He comes from a family of farmers who have been farming in California for over 50 years. He has been working full-time since he was 16 to help put himself through college. He attended Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, California, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 2002.

At the age of 19, in 1998, he became the youngest person ever elected to the Healdsburg School Board. In 2004, he was elected to the Healdsburg City Council, where he spent six years, including time as the city's youngest mayor. In 2010, he became a member of the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors.

In 2014, McGuire ran for the California State Senate to succeed Democratic Senator Noreen Evans, who decided not to seek reelection. He easily defeated the Republican candidate for the District 2 State Senate seat that year, winning 70% of the vote. The 2nd district encompasses the North Coast region, from Marin County to Del Norte County.

Since January 19, 2022, he has served as Majority Leader of the Senate, replacing Robert Hertzberg. He is also set to assume office as President pro tempore of the California State Senate on February 5, 2024.

Throughout his career, McGuire has been a champion for public schools and has led the charge in the legislature on wildfires. He is also a leading voice in holding PG&E accountable. He has been successful at securing resources to combat homelessness and build affordable housing in rural California.

Mike McGuire, his wife Erika, an elementary school principal, along with their son Connor, call Sonoma County home.
