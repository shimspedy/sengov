In 1974, Roger joined his family business, the Niello Auto Group, and spent the next 25 years running retail automobile dealerships with his family partners. He served as corporate Chief Financial Officer and was president and general manager of several of the group’s franchises. While involved in the retail auto business, Roger was recognized for his service in the industry as American International Automobile Dealer Association All Star Dealer and the Central Valley New Car Dealer Association Dealer of the Year.

After his time in the Assembly concluded, Roger accepted an appointment as President and CEO of the Sacramento Metro Chamber of Commerce. Roger was elected to represent Placer and Sacramento counties in the State Senate in 2022.

Throughout his career, Roger has been a dedicated community and civic volunteer, including service as President of the Golden State Voter Participation, Chair of the Sacramento Valley Lincoln Club Board, Co-Chair of the California Civic Learning Partnership in Sacramento County, member of the University of California Center Sacramento Advisory Board, the Dignity Health Sacramento Service Area Hospital Community Board, the Greater Sacramento Economic Council Board, and Sacramento Rotary.
