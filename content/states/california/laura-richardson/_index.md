Elected in November 2024 to represent California’s 35th Senate District, Senator Laura Richardson is deeply committed to improving the lives of residents in communities across the district she represents. She began her career in public service long before she was ever elected to office. She served as a legislative staffer at the local, state, and federal levels.

After playing collegiate basketball at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Laura transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles, where she earned a Bachelor’s degree in political science. She then pushed herself and—while working full-time for a Fortune 40 company—Laura kept going to school and earned a Master’s Degree in Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Southern California.

In 2000, Laura was elected to serve on the Long Beach City Council. After six years, she would go on to serve in the California State Assembly, representing the 55th District. Unfortunately, while serving in the Assembly, her mentor and former boss, Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald, suddenly passed away. Laura was elected in 2007 to represent the residents of the 37th Congressional District in the House of Representatives, where she served three terms in Congress.

Throughout her time in public office, Laura has worked hard and earned a reputation for bringing important resources to her district.

She is proud of her legislative record and her committed staff that worked to resolve resident casework for disabilities and Social Security that changed lives.

Laura currently lives in San Pedro, where she remains involved in the community and continues working to empower residents, better neighborhoods, and enhance local businesses and the economy.
