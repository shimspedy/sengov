LaShae Sharp-Collins was elected to the California State Assembly in November 2024 to represent the 79th Assembly District, which encompasses parts of southeastern San Diego, El Cajon, La Mesa, and Lemon Grove, as well as the unincorporated communities of Bonita, La Presa, and Spring Valley.

LaShae attended John F. Kennedy Elementary, Gompers Secondary School, and Lincoln High School. After graduating from Lincoln High School, she attended San Diego State University, earning a bachelor’s degree in Africana Studies, a master’s degree in Education with an emphasis on Multicultural Counseling, and an Ed.D. in Educational Leadership. She later returned to San Diego State University as an adjunct professor in the Department of Africana Studies, where she mentored the next generation of leaders.

One of LaShae’s most transformative roles was serving as District Director for former Assemblymember Dr. Shirley N. Weber, who is now California’s Secretary of State. In this role, LaShae managed staff, developed policy, and played a central role in addressing critical issues facing the 79th Assembly District. She worked closely with stakeholders to pass landmark legislation, including efforts to reduce violence in communities of color and to hold school districts accountable for spending taxpayer dollars.

Prior to being elected to the Assembly, LaShae served as the Community Engagement Specialist for the San Diego County Office of Education, where she collaborated with 42 school districts and supported over 500,000 students. Her work focused on strengthening curriculums, fostering partnerships, and ensuring that families have access to health screenings, career training, and quality schools.

LaShae lives in San Diego with her two children.
