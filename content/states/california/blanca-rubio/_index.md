Assemblywoman Blanca E. Rubio was elected in November 2016 to represent California’s 48th Assembly District, which includes the cities and Communities of West Covina, Baldwin Park, Glendora, Covina, Azusa, West Puente Valley, Valinda, Duarte, South San Jose Hills, Vincent, Citrus, Charter Oak, South Monrovia Island, Mayflower Village, Irwindale, Monrovia.

Blanca has worked tirelessly to give her constituents a voice in the Capitol, placing advocacy for children, women, families, students, and immigrants at the forefront of her work. Since her election in 2016, Blanca has authored bills that support victims of domestic violence, create opportunities for children within the foster care system, ensure our youngest students are given proper support to succeed in school, and support for immigrant communities. Blanca also has the distinction of serving on a number of Assembly Committees including: Aging and Long Term Care, Budget, Elections, Governmental Organization, Rules and Water Parks & Wildlife. She also serves as the Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on Domestic Violence.

Before coming to the Assembly, Blanca spent 16 years as a teacher and 20 years in elected office, serving on the Valley County Water Board and Baldwin Park Unified School District. Her students-first philosophy made Blanca a leader and champion for students in and out of the classroom. She was successful in her efforts to improve academic outcomes for students, aligning them with vital resources for college preparation.

Blanca was born in Juarez, Mexico, and came to the United States with her parents at a young age.  Her personal experiences have given her a genuine understanding of the everyday struggles and barriers that immigrants and working families continue to face in the United States.

Assemblymember Rubio received her Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration and Master’s Degree in Education with a Multiple Subject Teaching Credential from Azusa Pacific University. Blanca is a resident of Baldwin Park and a proud mother of two children.
