Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo was elected to the California State Assembly in November of 2022 to represent the 40th Assembly District, representing the Northwest San Fernando Valley and the Santa Clarita Valley. Upon her election, she was appointed as Assistant Majority Whip by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.

Prior to her election, Assemblywoman Schiavo was a Small Business Owner and Nurse Advocate who worked in the labor movement for more than 20 years on issues that deeply impact people’s lives, including expanding healthcare access and affordability, winning real solutions to homelessness, advocating for housing people can afford, and delivering on good jobs that allow families to thrive.

Throughout her career, Assemblywoman Schiavo helped deliver healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, to more than one million people. In the Northwest San Fernando Valley, she co-founded an organization that helped secure housing for Veterans experiencing homelessness, has delivered more than 50,000 meals to people in need, and increased resources to help keep our communities safe.

Assemblywoman Schiavo is the daughter of small business owners. Her father was a logger who became an electrician after two battles with cancer after exposure to Agent Orange while serving in the military, and her mom was a bookkeeper and managed the family electrical business. When her dad got a union job, she saw the life-changing impacts it had on her family – it is that formative experience, along with her desire to help children  and families, that led her to the labor movement where she fought to lift up families just like hers.

Assemblywoman Schiavo lives in Chatsworth with her daughter Sofia where they love to hike in the Santa Susana Mountains. She has been involved in the PTA of her daughter’s neighborhood public school. Her stepdaughter Germany graduated from Granada Hills Charter High School and is now a senior in college studying business administration.
