A lifelong advocate for public safety, Stefani has worked tirelessly to address gun violence, domestic violence, and corruption. As a former prosecutor with the Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office, she fought to protect vulnerable victims.

She championed affordable housing initiatives, fought for humane solutions to homelessness, and prioritized investments in education and public safety. Her collaborative leadership style and ability to deliver results earned her widespread recognition, including re-election in 2022 with strong community support.

She earned her law degree from McGeorge School of Law and gained policy expertise working with leaders like San Jose Vice Mayor Cindy Chavez and former California Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson.
