Alexandra Macedo was born and raised in Tulare, California to a family deeply rooted in Agriculture. From a young age, Alexandra has had a passion for the agriculture industry. Following graduation from Tulare Union High School, Alexandra attended California State University, Northridge where she obtained her B.S. in Business Law.

Following the completion of her undergraduate degree, Alexandra returned to the Central Valley. She partnered with her mother, Tina, in Macedo Engineering & Consulting, Inc, to provide support for dairy and crop farmers. Very quickly Alexandra recognized a need for agricultural attorneys to fight for and protect the industry she loved so dearly.

This led her to San Joaquin College of Law in Clovis, California. Alexandra continued to manage the business throughout her law school career while commuting and being a full-time student. She graduated in May of 2021, and now is the President of Macedo Environmental Consulting, Inc. Her business offers environmental compliance assistance and consulting along with agricultural design and project management.

She works closely with various governmental regulatory and planning agencies including State Water Resource Board, San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, Tulare County Resource Management Agency, Central Valley Dairy Resource Management Program, California Dairy Quality Assurance Program, and many others.

Alexandra is also the fourth generation to be a part of her family’s livestock market, Tulare Sales Yard, which has been in her family since 1939. Alexandra’s family is also carrying on the family tradition of farming almonds on property that her late grandfather owned. In addition to the many hats she wears, Alexandra has served on multiple advisory boards and committees for regulation facing the agriculturists on California and regularly visits classrooms and youth groups to educate them on where their food comes from.

Alexandra’s love and passion for the agriculture industry is present in all that she does, and she takes the responsibility of carrying on this tradition for generations to come very seriously. Alexandra plans to run for office so she can continue to serve the men and women of the agricultural community and to effect change on a much larger scale.
