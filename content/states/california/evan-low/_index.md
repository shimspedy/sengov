Evan Low represents District 26 in the California State Assembly after first being elected in 2014. At the time, Assemblymember Low was the youngest Asian American legislator ever elected to the Assembly. District 26 includes the cities of Cupertino, San José, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale, and the unincorporated Santa Clara County districts of Burbank and Fruitvale.

Assemblymember Low also oversees the work of a few caucuses. In 2015, he launched the California Legislative Technology & Innovation Caucus, which is a bi-partisan group of Assemblymembers and Senators. The statewide goal is to ensure California remains the global leader in technology and innovation. Assemblymember Low is also Chair of the California Asian American & Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus and a Member of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus.

Assemblymember Low was born and raised in Silicon Valley, and these roots inspired him to pursue a career in service. His work in the community and deep understanding of issues concerning residents led him to run for a seat on the Campbell City Council in 2006. His election victory made him the first Asian American to serve on the City Council.

In 2010, Assemblymember Low made history once again as the youngest openly LGBTQ+ mayor in the country at age 26. While serving in Campbell, he helped balance the city's budget without eliminating vital services, and he increased government transparency by streaming City Council meetings online. During this time, Assemblymember Low consistently emphasized helping small businesses and job growth by cutting red tape and streamlining the licensing process for business owners.

Assemblymember Low has been named "Legislator of the Year" by the Internet Association, TechNet, The Computing Technology Industry Association, California Faculty Association, Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, California District Attorneys Association, and Faculty Association of California Community Colleges. He has also served as a community college instructor at De Anza Community College, where he taught American Government and Political Science.

Assemblymember Low attended local public schools and earned degrees from De Anza and San José State University. He went on to graduate from Harvard University's Senior Executives in State and Local Government Program.
