Assemblymember Michelle Rodriguez, a lifelong resident of the 53rd Assembly District, brings a deep commitment to community, family, and public service. Born and raised in Ontario, Rodriguez is a proud working-class mother and grandmother who has dedicated her life to supporting her community while raising four children—each of whom has followed her example of service. Her children include a deputy sheriff, a store manager, an EMT/firefighter, and a respiratory therapist, all raised in Pomona. Michelle’s grandchildren are also growing up in the district, continuing her family’s deep roots in the region.

Together with her husband, former Assemblymember and EMT Freddie Rodriguez, Assemblymember Michelle Rodriguez has exemplified the spirit of public service. While raising her family, she worked in local public schools and healthcare, led a Girl Scout troop, and served as Athletic Director for community sports leagues. Rodriguez earned her Medical Assistant Certification from Northwest College and built a career in healthcare, working with Inter Valley Health Plan and ProMed Healthcare Administrators. Her dedication to education and youth programs led her to roles as a security professional with Chaffey and Bonita Unified School Districts and as a supporter of young mothers at Valley View High School.

Rodriguez’s passion for public safety and community well-being extends to her service on the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST), where she works with fellow commissioners to set rigorous training standards for law enforcement officers and promote professionalism across the state.

As a survivor of gun violence, the mother of a deputy sheriff, a Neighborhood Watch organizer, and a dedicated public servant, Assemblymember Michelle Rodriguez understands firsthand the challenges faced by working families and the urgency of creating safer neighborhoods. Her lived experiences inspire her deep commitment to public safety, equity, and creating opportunities in her community.
