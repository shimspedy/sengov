Kevin McCarty represents the 6th Assembly District including the majority of the City of Sacramento and parts of the unincorporated County.

Since 2014 McCarty has chaired the Assembly Budget Subcommittee on Education Finance, overseeing historic increases in early education, funding schools at record levels, and expanding college access and affordability.

McCarty has authored over 75 measures that became law, including landmark legislation providing universal preschool, restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, ensuring independent investigations for police shootings, and creating the American River Parkway Conservancy.

A lifelong Sacramentan, McCarty began his career as a Housing and Redevelopment Commissioner, and then served on the Sacramento City Council for a decade.

After receiving his high school diploma through adult education, he attended American River Community College and earned degrees from CSU Long Beach and CSU Sacramento. McCarty and his wife live in Sacramento with their twin daughters Victoria and Barbara.
