McKinnor currently serves as Chair of the Public Employment and Retirement Committee and serves on the following policy committees: Business and Professions Committee, Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee and the Governmental Organization Committee. Additionally, in March 2023, Speaker Rendon appointed McKinnor to the State Coastal Conservancy.

As a legislator, Assemblymember McKinnor will prioritize California’s continued COVID-19 recovery, increase funding for public education, expand universal access to healthcare, address the state’s housing and homelessness crisis, reform the state’s broken criminal justice system, demand environmental justice for communities most impacted by the climate crisis and seek equity for communities of color in the cannabis industry.

Prior to her election to the State Assembly, McKinnor served as Civic Engagement Director for the non-profit LAVoice and previously served as Operational Director for the California Democratic Party and Chief of Staff to several Members of the State Assembly. McKinnor received a BA in Accounting from California State University, Dominguez Hills. McKinnor was born and raised in Los Angeles County and is the mother of two adult sons.
