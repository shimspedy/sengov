Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva serves as California’s 67th Assembly District representative, which includes the communities of Anaheim, Artesia, Cerritos, Cypress, Buena Park, Fullerton, Hawaiian Gardens, and La Palma. The Assemblywoman is currently serving her fifth term as a representative in the California State Assembly.

She currently sits as the Chair of the Assembly Arts, Entertainment, Sports, and Tourism Committee and is a member of the Joint Committee on the Arts. She also sits on the following Assembly standing committees: Education, Governmental Organization, as well as Housing and Community Development.

Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva was first elected to serve in the California Assembly in 2012. In 2016, she regained her seat to serve the constituents of North Orange County. In 2018, the constituents re-elected her to serve the communities of Anaheim, Buena Park, Cypress, Fullerton, Garden Grove, La Palma, and Stanton. After being reelected in 2020, Assemblywoman Quirk-Silva was elected to the newly redrawn 67th Assembly District in 2022, encompassing North Orange County and parts of Los Angeles County.

Prior to her service in the State Legislature, she served in local government as a member of the Fullerton City Council from 2004 to 2012, including serving two-terms as Mayor. As a life-long resident of Fullerton, Assemblywoman Quirk-Silva has a close relationship with the North Orange County community.  Assemblywoman Quirk-Silva is a mother of four and married to Jesus Silva, former Fullerton City Councilmember and teacher.

As a life-long resident of Fullerton Assemblywoman Quirk-Silva has close relations with the community.  She was educated in Fullerton public schools through 12th grade and went on to earn an Associate of Arts degree from Fullerton College, a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology at University of California, Los Angeles, and a Teaching Credential from California State University, Fullerton. As one of ten children, she honed negotiating skills and learned the advantages of teamwork early on.  As a teacher in the Fullerton School District, Sharon was able to learn about the concerns of her community first hand.  A practice she has continued with her work in the State Assembly. Quirk-Silva has been a strong influence in her Assembly District community, and in the lives of her constituents and their families, paving the way for the next generation of California's leaders. As a legislator, she is passionate about all Californians having access to affordable housing, quality education, and access to physical and mental health services.

Quirk-Silva’s history of local service in Orange County guides her philosophy on how state government should operate. Solutions are found at home, within the community. Her office’s priorities are simple: to use constituent feedback to prioritize the issues, to focus on finding solutions for the people she represents, and demand that Orange County residents receive their fair share of state services.

At the top of her list of priorities are affordable housing, addressing the homelessness crisis, and supporting California’s businesses. Her focus has been to continue to advocate for her top priorities, having passed many bills addressing causes of Housing and Homelessness, Education, Public Safety, and Mental Health.

Joint-Authored: AB 2 Community Colleges: California College Promise that was signed into law;
And many other budget and legislative wins that can be reviewed her
Ever since the beginning of her career holding office, she has been active in organizations serving all of District 67 and Orange County, becoming familiar with our district's cities and developing relationships with their leaders. Sharon knows the importance of community action and advocacy for Orange County's families and businesses. She will take to Sacramento that tireless advocacy and talent for bringing people together to solve problems. As a wife and mother Sharon understands the challenges California families face in today’s difficult economy. She has cast key votes in the State Assembly after two terms in office, and is always ready to engage in more valuable causes for the State of California into the future.

Assemblywoman Quirk-Silva is a mother of four children and married to Jesus Silva, Fullerton Council Member and Teacher.
