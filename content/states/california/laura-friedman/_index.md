First elected to the California State Assembly in November 2016, Laura Friedman represents the cities of Burbank, Glendale, and Los Angeles, as well as the communities of La Crescenta, Lake View Terrace, Montrose, North Hollywood, Shadow Hills, Sherman Oaks, Sunland-Tujunga, Studio City, Toluca Lake, and Valley Village.

Laura’s legislative work is focused in three primary areas: addressing the housing affordability and homelessness crisis, combating climate change, and protecting vulnerable communities.  She has authored a package of bills to create new avenues for communities to tackle the affordable housing crisis, encourage water conservation, strengthen environmental sustainability, protect communities against devastating wildfires, improve access to higher education and health care, and ensure that California’s foster youth have the support that they need as they transition to adulthood.

During her time in the Assembly, Laura has secured over $60 million in funding for key projects across the district, including: $30 million in funding for the completion of the Glendale Riverwalk Project, $9 million in active transportation and safety improvements in and around Griffith Park, $6 million to refurbish the Glendale Central Library, $6 million for improvements along the Verdugo Wash, $5 million for infrastructure and active transportation improvements in Burbank, and $5 million to improve safety along the LA River in North Atwater Village.

Laura has been tapped for several leadership roles in the legislature, including the Chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee, Chair of the Assembly Natural Resources Committee, Assistant Speaker pro Tempore for the Assembly, the Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, the Assembly Select Committee on Urban Development to Combat Climate Change, and the Chair of the Joint Rules Subcommittee on Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response where she led a historic bicameral and bipartisan reform of the legislature’s response to sexual harassment that’s become a model for other states and local governments to follow.

Long recognized as a steadfast advocate for the environment, sustainable communities, and active transportation, in 2020 she was appointed to serve as the Chair for the Assembly Committee on Transportation and remained in that role through 2023.  Her time as Chair marked a shift towards forward-thinking policies such as investing in mass transit, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, zero-emission vehicles, road safety, and sustainability. She has championed data-driven transportation policy that focuses on the link between housing and transportation, and improving road safety for all users, including landmark legislation to provide local communities with greater flexibility to set speed limits on their roadways.

Laura currently serves as the Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on Biodiversity, Chair of the bicameral Environmental Caucus, and as the Policy Chair of the Progressive Caucus.  She serves as a member of the Assembly Committees on Arts, Entertainment, Sports, and Tourism; Budget; Natural Resources; Water, Parks, and Wildlife; and the Budget Subcommittee on Climate Crisis, Resources, Energy, and Transportation.

Laura got her start in the private sector working as a film and television executive and producer after receiving her B.A. from the University of Rochester, New York.  Building on her years of community service, she was elected to the Glendale City Council in 2009, served as Mayor from 2011 through 2012 and was re-elected in 2013.
