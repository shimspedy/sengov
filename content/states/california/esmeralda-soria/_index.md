Assemblymember Esmeralda Soria was elected to the California State Assembly in November of 2022 to represent the 27th Assembly District.

A first-generation American and daughter of farm workers, Esmeralda knows firsthand about hard work and sacrifice, having worked alongside her parents in the Central Valleyâ€™s agricultural fields throughout her childhood. She then worked her way through college and law school.

Assemblymember Soria served as an educator, community advocate, and Fresno City Councilmember. As Councilmember, Soria led efforts to increase public safety and community development, create thousands of  good-paying jobs, build affordable and accessible housing, tackle homelessness, and expand access to parks and greenspace.

Soria also fought to deliver millions of dollars in funding to the Central Valley for water, new health clinics, and local public schools. Soria will continue fighting for the residents of the Central Valley while in Sacramento on the issues that matter the most to them.

She was born and raised in the Central Valley.
