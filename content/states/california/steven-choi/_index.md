Dr. Steven Choi is an immigrant, educator, small business owner, and now Senator-Elect for California’s 37th District.

Steven Choi was born in South Korea and served as a 2nd lieutenant in the South Korean Army. After his military service, he immigrated to the United States as a Peace Corps translator along with a dream to become an educator.

Steven Choi eventually found his way to New York City, where he washed dishes in the back of a restaurant and worked as a busboy in a hotel to pay his way through schools. That hard work paid off when he earned a Ph.D. and went on to teach at higher institutions such as the University of Southern California, and the University of California, Irvine. He also opened a small business with his wife, to help tutor local students in various subjects.

From there, Dr. Choi went on to serve as a School Board Trustee with the Irvine Unified School District, Mayor of Irvine, Assemblymember for the 68th District, and now State Senator of the 37th District.

The American Dream is real, and Steven Choi is living proof of that dream.
