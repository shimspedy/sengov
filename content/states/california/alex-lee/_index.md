Alex Lee (李天明) represents California’s 24th Assembly District which includes the Alameda County communities of Fremont, Newark, and Sunol, and the Santa Clara County communities of Milpitas and San Jose.

Assemblymember Lee was elected in 2020, and became the youngest Asian American legislator ever elected and the first openly bisexual state legislator in California history. He currently serves as Chair of the Committee on Human Services, the Select Committee on Social Housing, and the Legislative Progressive Caucus.

In his first year in office, Assemblymember Lee was named “Legislator of the Year'' by the Golden State Manufactured Home Owners League as well as the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice.

He was also named the 2022 "Legislator of the Year" by the East Bay Young Democrats, and received the "Up & Comer" award from Building the California Dream Alliance. Assemblymember Lee was recognized as one of the nation's top "20 Under 40" officials by the Council of State Governments.

Previously, he worked on statewide policy regarding public safety, climate change, and education for California State Senator Henry Stern and Assemblymember Evan Low. Assemblymember Lee has been a Bay Area resident since birth, calling both San Jose and Milpitas his home for all his life. He is a graduate of Milpitas High School and the University of California, Davis, where he served as Student Body President.
