Scott was born and raised in the 21st Senate District and has represented the area in the state Legislature since 2012. Hailing from a working class family, he supports policies that bring mortgage-paying jobs to California and opposes those that place economic burdens on already struggling families.

Scott believes in working across the aisle to craft meaningful solutions to Californiaâ€™s very real problems. In 2023 he was named Co-Chair the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bicameral, bipartisan group of legislators who prioritize finding meaningful solutions over party ideology. He is a presiding officer of the Senate, as well as an appointee to both the Little Hoover Commission and the State Allocation Board.

Scott understands that a helping hand can be the difference between struggling and success. He has tirelessly worked to ensure those who need our help have a voice in Sacramento. In 2018 Scott was the recipient of Easterseals California's "2018 Senate Champion Award" and in 2019 Social Compassion in Legislation (SCIL) honored Scott with the "Compassionate Legislative Champion" Award.

Scott and his wife, Vanessa, reside with their two spoiled dogs, Simi V and AV; have two adult children, Scott Jr. (Brooke, daughter in-law) and Alison (Matt, son in-law); and are the shamelessly proud grandparents of two precious grandsons - Zeke (Alison & Matt) and Finn (Scott, Jr. & Brooke).
