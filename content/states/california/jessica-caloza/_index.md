She believes in the power of government and how it can transform lives when it works. Jessica worked on education policy issues in President Barack Obama’s Administration, helping underfunded schools get more resources.

In 2019, Jessica was appointed as a Public Works Commissioner where she led infrastructure projects, expanded good-paying union jobs, raised wages for workers, and required equal pay for women while increasing transparency and accountability. She went on to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff to the Attorney General at the California Department of Justice, where she worked to reduce crime and gun violence, helped survivors of sexual assault receive justice, and taken bold action to protect the environment.

In the Assembly, Jessica will prioritize reducing the cost of living, building more affordable housing, investing in public education, supporting small businesses, protecting a woman's right to choose, and ensuring California leads the nation and world in fighting the climate crisis.
