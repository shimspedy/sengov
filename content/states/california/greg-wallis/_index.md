Greg Wallis is a third-generation Californian who is working for a California that is affordable, safe and vibrant.

Greg studied political science before moving to the Coachella Valley more than a decade ago. He married his high school sweetheart, Desiree, and they make their home in Bermuda Dunes with their Great Dane, Harley, and Australian Cattle Dog, Gunner.

Greg enjoys volunteering with kids, from coaching young golfers to assisting his wife with her work as a dance coach and ASB director to supporting the mission of the local Boys & Girls Club.

When many of Greg’s friends began moving out of California because they could not afford the cost of living here, he decided it was time to run for the State Assembly. He ran on the belief that California can do a better job preparing young people for careers and college, promoting common sense public safety policy that supports law enforcement, and focusing on providing core government services like water storage and energy reliability without higher costs that drive families out of the state.

In his first year in office, Greg immediately joined the Problem Solvers Caucus, dedicated to putting the public good over partisan politics. He serves as Vice Chair of the Assembly’s Revenue & Taxation Committee and the Arts, Entertainment, Sports & Tourism Committee. He is a member of the Committees on Utilities & Energy; Higher Education; Jobs, Economic Development & the Economy; and he serves on the Joint Committee on the Arts.
