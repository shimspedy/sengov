Vince Fong was elected to represent the 32nd Assembly District, which encompasses most of Kern County including Bakersfield, Bear Valley Springs, Frazier Park, Glennville, Kernville, Lake Isabella, Maricopa, Oildale, Ridgecrest, Taft, and Tehachapi as well as parts of Tulare County including Exeter, Kaweah, Springville, Three Rivers and Visalia.

From a young age, Vince knew that he wanted to positively affect the region that he has always called home, and he recognized that policy provided him with the opportunity to achieve this goal.

Vince began his career with Congressman Bill Thomas, Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, working on international trade policy to open up markets for our nation’s farmers and small businesses. He then returned home to serve the residents of Kern County.

For nearly a decade, he served as the district director to House Majority Leader and Congressman Kevin McCarthy, where he managed public policy issues for the region, worked to create jobs, made commonsense reforms, and fought to improve the quality of life for our neighbors and families.

Vince has helped to lead the conversation on energy independence in California and worked to develop policies that permit business expansion and enhance job opportunities for local residents. He has worked with local small business owners to create a climate for small business growth. He helped organize the Valley Fever Symposium, bringing the issue into the national spotlight and convincing leaders in healthcare to conduct research and find solutions to a growing problem.

Each day, Vince works with local leaders and organizations to put California’s job climate back on track. He has seen first-hand the burdens of bureaucracy and red tape. His efforts to lower taxes, reduce burdensome regulations and limit government overreach, remind elected leaders that free-markets and competition are the keys to a successful economy and good-paying jobs.

Vince is a lifelong resident of Kern County. He earned a bachelor’s degree from UCLA and master’s from Princeton University. He serves on the boards of the Jim Burke Education Foundation and Honor Flight Kern County where he works to send WWII, Korean War and Vietnam Veterans to Washington, DC to see their memorials.
