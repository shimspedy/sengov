Jesse Gabriel is an attorney, civic leader, and lawmaker fighting to advance justice and defend California’s most vulnerable residents. A creative thinker with a proven record of bringing together diverse communities, Jesse proudly represents the San Fernando Valley in the California Legislature. Recognized as a “California Influencer” by the Sacramento Bee, Jesse has authored more than two dozen new laws, including highly regarded measures to address California’s housing and homelessness crisis, fight climate change, reduce gun violence, strengthen hate crimes protections, and expand access to justice for all.

In Sacramento, Jesse has been “one of the most outspoken legislators on gun violence” and a leader in the fight to make California a national model for commonsense gun safety laws. As the Co-Founder of California’s Gun Violence Working Group, Jesse partnered with former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, Moms Demand Action, and Governor Gavin Newsom to successfully enact critical gun safety legislation.

As Chair of the Assembly Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee, Jesse is a passionate advocate for protecting kids online and helped to shepherd groundbreaking reforms to enhance the safety and well-being of children on the Internet. In the face of fierce opposition from Big Tech, Jesse organized a coalition of prominent civil rights, LGBTQ, faith, and labor organizations to pass first-in-the-nation legislation requiring major social media companies to address online hate speech, racism, and conspiracy theories on their platforms.

Jesse is consistently ranked as one of the Legislature’s most committed environmentalists. A former Board Member of the LA League of Conservation Voters, he has championed efforts to address climate change, expand EV charging infrastructure, encourage water conservation, and protect California’s precious natural resources.

Jesse also serves as Chair of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, where he has led the effort to unite diverse communities to combat hate and bigotry of all forms. He has authored new laws to strengthen hate crime protections, support undocumented Californians, and establish the California Nonprofit Security Grant Program to secure vulnerable communities targeted by hate.

Before being elected to the Legislature, Jesse worked as a constitutional rights and general litigation attorney, where he represented clients in state and federal courts, including the United States Supreme Court. In 2017, Jesse sued the Trump Administration in two landmark lawsuits to protect young people–known as Dreamers–who were promised protection under the DACA program. As of 2023, more than 600,000 Dreamers have been able to renew their DACA status because of this litigation. Jesse also represented Holocaust survivors, victims of domestic abuse, and communities facing targeted violence.

After graduating from UC Berkeley and Harvard Law School, Jesse worked as a Senior Advisor in the United States Senate, where he focused on civil rights, hate crime prevention, gender pay equity, and Iran sanctions legislation. He also assisted with the Senate confirmation of numerous federal judges, including Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.

Jesse lives in the San Fernando Valley with his wife, Rachel Rosner–an affordable housing attorney–and their sons Ethan, Joshua, and Noah. He is an enthusiastic youth soccer coach and long-suffering Cal sports fan.
