Catherine Blakespear was elected in 2022 as the state senator for the 38th district, which represents northern San Diego County and southern Orange County. Catherine previously served eight years in local government, six years as the Encinitas Mayor and two years on the Encinitas City Council.

As mayor of Encinitas, Catherine made her city the first in the County to deliver 100% renewable power and passed a tough climate action plan to reduce emissions.

When the pandemic hit, Catherine delivered emergency financial assistance to help local businesses keep their doors open. As mayor, Catherine banned ghost guns, passed tough safe gun storage requirements, and supported red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who are a potential threat and made her city one of the safest in California. Additionally, Catherine improved water infrastructure during her time as Vice President of the San Dieguito Water Board, ensuring customers a reliable, clean water supply.

Catherine has been a champion of women’s reproductive rights since before entering public life.  Catherine is proud to have been 100% pro-choice, 100% of the time.

Catherine’s priorities include reducing human suffering by helping our unhoused neighbors to become housed, stabilizing our warming climate, increasing transit options, strengthening the economy, fighting gun violence, building more affordable housing, and creating more opportunities for every California family to thrive.

Catherine lives with her husband, two teenagers and her mom in Encinitas.
