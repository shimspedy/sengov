Elected to represent California’s 29th Senate District in November 2024, Senator Eloise Gómez Reyes continues her legacy of public service and commitment to representing the residents of the greater Inland Empire region.

In 2016, Eloise Gómez Reyes was previously sworn in as a California State Assemblymember. Upon being sworn into her first term in the Assembly, Eloise was named co-chair to the Legislative Ethics Committee. In the second year of her first term, she was appointed Assistant Majority Whip - a leadership position that ensured that legislative floor sessions operated efficiently.

In 2018, in response to growing concerns regarding the workplace culture in the Legislature, Eloise was appointed to the Subcommittee on Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response which produced recommendations to improve workplace protections for Legislative employees and others that interact with the Legislature, through the creation of the independent oversight entity, the Workplace Conduct Unit was created to investigate and make recommendations on workplace harassment claims.

During her service in the Assembly, Eloise championed bills and issues that increase equity and inclusion in vulnerable communities throughout the state. These efforts include AB 2147 which led a national conversation on second chances for inmate firefighters giving them a pathway to expunge their records and pursue a career in firefighting.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Eloise introduced AB 685, which requires businesses to notify their employees if they have been exposed to Covid-19 and report that information to public health authorities.

Eloise championed bills and issues that increase equity and inclusion in vulnerable communities.

Eloise, a proud daughter of immigrants, has been a champion for her community throughout her career. The lack of access to quality legal services in her community led her to become the first Latina to open her own law firm in the Inland Empire in order to provide necessary representation to her community.

Eloise graduated from Colton High School and received her A.A. from San Bernardino Valley College. She received her Bachelors of Science degree at the University of Southern California and then Eloise went on to earn her law degree from Loyola Law School.

In December 2020, Assemblymember Eloise Gómez Reyes was appointed as Majority Leader of the California State Assembly, becoming the first Latina and only the fourth woman to hold the position.
