Senator Suzette Martinez Valladares is a dedicated small businesswoman with deep roots in the Santa Clarita Valley, who has also worked extensively throughout the Antelope Valley and High Desert. Starting her career at Six Flags Magic Mountain and pursuing higher education at College of the Canyons before transferring to CSU Northridge, Suzette has always been committed to our community.

As the former Executive Director of Southern California Autism Speaks, Suzette’s leadership has been recognized with honors such as the “SCV 40 under Forty” by the Santa Clarita Business Journal. Her entrepreneurial spirit shines through her management of an early childcare center founded by her mother, a legacy she continues to honor following her mother’s passing in 2018 after a heroic battle with cancer.

Representing California State Senate District 23, she is focused on lowering taxes and the high cost of living in California, supporting law enforcement, strengthening public safety laws, addressing the homelessness and fentanyl crises, and building a community where today’s children can thrive. Her deep family roots in the region and the experience of raising her daughter drive her passion to create a more affordable and safer community for everyone.

Community and public service are central to Suzette’s ethos. She has served on community boards and led organizations, including the esteemed LAPD Devonshire PALS, a partnership with law enforcement investing in at-risk youth. Elected to the California State Assembly in 2020, Suzette was a founding member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. In the State Assembly, she authored landmark legislation to make preschool more accessible and affordable for working parents, co-authored a gas tax reduction, and authored a law providing more resources for crime victims. Suzette also fought successfully to reopen Six Flags and other Southern California businesses and brought local vaccine clinics to the most vulnerable during the pandemic.

Suzette Martinez Valladares has built a reputation for achieving results in small business, charitable organizations, and public service.

Suzette and her husband Shane live in Acton with their daughter Charlotte, where they continue to be active and dedicated parents and members of this community.
