Elected to represent the 25th Senate District in November 2024, Senator Sasha Renée Pérez was born and raised in Alhambra, where her family has lived for over 50 years. Her father is an electrician and her mother is a social worker. After graduating from Mark Keppel High School, Pérez became the first in her family to graduate from college, earning degrees in Political Science and Economics from California State University, Los Angeles.

In college, Pérez led a statewide campaign that successfully secured $97 million dollars to increase college access and affordability for all California students. During the same time, she was elected to her local neighborhood council and worked on issues such as neighborhood beautification and transportation.

Since graduating, Pérez has continued her work on pressing policy issues, led statewide campaigns, and educated constituents from across California on how to effectively fight for policies to improve their community. Over the last decade, she has played an important role in passing historic legislation that increased healthcare access, expanded government transparency, and provided protections for victims of violent crimes.

Pérez led a statewide campaign that secured $97 million dollars to increase college access and affordability for California students.

In November 2020, Pérez was elected to Alhambra City Council and immediately sworn in as Mayor, making her the youngest female mayor in San Gabriel Valley history and the youngest Latina mayor to lead a city of more than 50,000 in California. 

Pérez continues to be an active community member volunteering her time at food banks and as a board member to Asian Youth Center, a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to empowering low-income, immigrant, and at-risk youth. In her free time, she enjoys hiking, supporting local restaurants, and reading with her cats.
