Shannon Lee Grove (born March 18, 1965) is an American politician who represents California's 12th State Senatorial district, encompassing the southern Central Valley and parts of the High Desert. A Republican, she served as the minority leader of the California State Senate from 2019 to 2021.

Grove previously served in the California State Assembly, representing the 34th State Assembly district, which encompassed most of Kern County. She is the chief executive officer of an employment agency she started in 1993 with her sister-in-law.

Grove was born in Kern County, California, and grew up there. She graduated from the Kern High School District. She spent three years in the U.S. Army, serving with Headquarters Company, 5th Corps, in Frankfurt, Germany, where she performed administrative tasks.

Upon returning to her native Kern County, California, Grove worked for two temporary staffing agencies before establishing her own temporary staffing company, Continental Labor & Staffing Resources, with her sister-in-law. The company subsequently expanded to Bakersfield, Ridgecrest, Paso Robles and Visalia.
