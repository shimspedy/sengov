Dr. Darshana R. Patel was elected in November 2024 to represent the 76th Assembly District in northern San Diego County. The district spans diverse communities, including the cities of Escondido, San Marcos, and San Diego, as well as the unincorporated areas of Del Dios, Elfin Forest, Fairbanks Ranch, Harmony Grove, Lake San Marcos, and Rancho Santa Fe.

A research scientist, school board president, and dedicated community leader, Dr. Patel brings a unique blend of expertise and compassion to public service. As the daughter of immigrants, she experienced firsthand the challenges of building a new life in California. Her journey was marked by tragedy at an early age when she lost her mother at 14—a loss that inspired her pursuit of medical and health research. After earning a B.A. in Biochemistry from Occidental College and a Ph.D. in Biophysics from the University of California, Irvine, she launched a successful career in biotechnology research before transitioning to community leadership.

In 2016, as the Poway Unified School District grappled with financial mismanagement and criminal embezzlement, Dr. Patel ran for the school board to help restore trust and effective governance. Elected as a Trustee, she focused on stabilizing the district’s finances, rebuilding governance structures, and navigating the educational challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her efforts earned her widespread community support, leading to her reelection in 2020 and her role as School Board President.

Beyond her local district, Dr. Patel has been a tireless advocate for educational equity and community engagement. She serves as President of the San Diego County School Boards Association and on the California Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander American Affairs, where she champions policies to promote inclusion and opportunity. She has also contributed to public safety as a member of the San Diego Police Department Northeastern Division Captain’s Advisory Board and has held leadership roles on the Rancho Peñasquitos Planning Board and Town Council.

Dr. Patel lives in San Diego with her husband and their three daughters.
