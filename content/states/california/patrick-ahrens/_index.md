Patrick Ahrens proudly represents the 26th Assembly District, located in the heart of Silicon Valley within the Santa Clara County. Assembly District 26 includes the cities of Cupertino, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale, and part of the City of San José including the communities of Alviso and West San José, as well as the unincorporated communities of Burbank and Fruitdale.

A native of Silicon Valley, Ahrens is deeply committed to addressing the challenges faced by his constituents in one of the most dynamic yet demanding regions of California. His journey into public service was shaped by his own challenges, including growing up in a house with substance abuse issues and facing homelessness and housing insecurity as a college student. These experiences fueled his passion for public service and inspired his career advocating for affordable housing and education equity. He has championed policies to expand access and affordability in higher education, focusing on supporting community college students and ensuring pathways for economic mobility.

Prior to joining the Assembly, Ahrens served as a Trustee on the Foothill-De Anza Community College District Board, where he led efforts to build affordable housing for faculty, staff, and students, and collaborated with Santa Clara County to establish a first-in-the-state medical clinic at De Anza College.

Assemblymember Ahrens is the Co-Chair of the California Legislative Technology & Innovation Caucus, and a Member of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus and the Bay Area Caucus.

A first-generation college graduate, Ahrens earned an associate degree from De Anza College, a bachelor’s degree from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and a master’s degree in public administration from San José State University. He resides in Sunnyvale and is proud to represent the vibrant communities of Santa Clara County in the State Assembly.
