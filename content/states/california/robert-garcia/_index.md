Assemblymember Robert Garcia is a dedicated educator, public servant, and proud son of immigrants, whose life has been shaped by a deep commitment to excellence in education. Raised by his hardworking parents, who made significant sacrifices to prioritize his education, Robert learned the value of perseverance and hard work from an early age. His mother, who was just 17 when she had him, and his father, who was unable to complete his education beyond the third grade, instilled in him the importance of academic achievement. At 17, Robert became the first in his family to graduate from high school.

Garcia’s academic journey continued at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he earned a bachelor’s degree in biology, followed by a master’s degree in public policy from the University of Southern California (USC). His passion for education was further ignited during his time volunteering as a mentor to high school students from under-resourced schools in Los Angeles, many of whom faced significant educational challenges. This experience motivated him to pursue a career as a teacher.

With over 20 years of experience in education, Garcia has served as both a classroom teacher and a school administrator. His leadership has helped guide schools through transformative changes, resulting in improved outcomes for students. As a math and science educator, Robert’s commitment to excellence has inspired countless students to pursue their academic and career goals.

In 2016, Garcia was elected to the Etiwanda School District Board of Trustees, where he was re-elected in 2020 with nearly 70% of the vote. During his tenure, he served as Board President and led the district through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic while earning national and local accolades. Under his leadership, the district received the prestigious California Exemplary District Award twice, and five of its schools earned National Blue Ribbon status.

Garcia’s commitment to education is driven by his belief in its ability to strengthen communities and create opportunities for all. It is this passion that led him to the State Assembly, where he aims to bring his experience and dedication to the Inland Empire. As an Assemblymember, he is focused on securing safe neighborhoods, fully funding public schools, reducing homelessness, creating good-paying jobs, and supporting small businesses in the region.

Assemblymember Robert Garcia and his wife, Samantha, along with their three children, proudly call Rancho Cucamonga home, where they continue to be active in their community.
