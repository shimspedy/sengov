As a single mom, small business owner, and former social worker, Debra has spent her life devoted to changing lives and making a difference. She will bring her passion for service, proven experience, leadership skills and strong work ethic to serving the citizens of Chesterfield County as a member of the House of Delegates for the 76th District.
A tireless advocate for those in need, Debra has worked both personally and professionally to make a difference for Virginians. After serving at the chief deputy level of 3 state agencies and devoting countless hours to organizations that provide aid and services to the community, she is uniquely qualified to represent the 76th District in the House of Delegates.
Debra’s commitment to helping people extends beyond her work life – she also serves the community through boards and committees devoted to changing lives. Her current and former boards include Smart Beginnings Board of Directors, Homeward Board of Directors, Senior Connections Board of Directors, the Virginia Drug Treatment Court Advisory Committee, the Virginia Substance Abuse Services Council, and the Domestic Violence Prevention Advisory Board.
A resident of Chesterfield County for more than 30 years, Debra and her daughter live in North Chesterfield. She holds a B.A. in sociology from North Carolina Central University and a Masters of Public Administration from Virginia Commonwealth University, where she later taught graduate courses in executive leadership.
Debra’s extensive public service experience, proven leadership skills, and strong work ethic mean that she’s not just going to work on behalf of the residents of the 76th District – she’s going to get things done for them.
