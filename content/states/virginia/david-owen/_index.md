David Owen comes from a long line of proud Virginians. His parents were Virginians. Their parents were Virginians. And he and his wife Ellen raised their son in Richmond, Virginia. 

Born and raised in Henrico County, David attended Tucker High School, before graduating from the University of Virginia with a B.S. in Civil Engineering. 

After college, he landed a job as a construction engineer with Texaco USA. This job briefly took him to Virginia Beach, where he met his wife, to whom he has been married for 33 years. 

David’s greatest role models were his parents, Christine and Bill. He credits Christine, a stay-at-home mom, for teaching him right from wrong, how to do things the right way, and how to be a professional young man. And he credits his dad for instilling in him a strong work ethic and teaching him how to treat others. 

His father Bill worked with the Highway Department (VDOT) for 40 years. After leaving VDOT, he worked at his “retired job” at the General Assembly for another 25 years. He started working at eight years old, and he clerked his last General Assembly committee meeting when he was 91. David’s father’s example has left a lasting, lifelong impression on David and will guide the work ethic and commitment to service of not only the campaign, but also as your next Delegate.

A general contractor by trade, David got his start working on the commercial and industrial side of construction. He switched to residential construction and home building after he and his family moved back to Richmond. David was part-owner of Boone Homes for the last 20 years. He and his partners sold the company five years ago, and David stopped working full-time last year so he could devote his time giving back to the Commonwealth that has given so much to him. 

For the last 20 years, David has been actively involved in the Richmond Home Building Association and the Home Building Association of Virginia, including serving as the Legislative Chairman, PAC Chair, Treasurer, and as President in 2021.

Through this work, he spent a lot of time dealing with the local government, meeting with legislators, speaking before General Assembly committees, and advocating for issues. So, he understands the inner-workings of the General Assembly and how to work on solving the issues affecting the citizens of the Commonwealth. And as a small business owner, home builder, and industry leader, David understands the challenges, obstacles, and burdens too many businesses and individuals face from onerous government regulations and red tape. 

That is why David is running to represent District 57 or the Virginia House of Delegates. He believes it is his turn to give back to the Commonwealth, just as his father so honorably did.
