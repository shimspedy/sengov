Senator Creigh Deeds has dedicated his life to fighting for a Virginia that works for everybody. Raised in Bath County on his grandparent’s farm, Creigh attended Bath County High School before graduating from Concord College. His grandfather, a local Democratic Committee Chair during the Great Depression, instilled in him a passion for democracy and helping others from an early age.

Determined to pursue a career of service, Creigh graduated from Wake Forest University with his law degree. He was later elected Commonwealth’s Attorney of Bath County. Four years later, Creigh won a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates, where he fought for working families for nearly a decade. He was then elected to serve in the State Senate, where he remains to this day.

As the most effective legislator in the Commonwealth, Creigh has passed more bills than any other member of the General Assembly. His track record includes delivering results on progressive issues such as gun violence reform, protecting abortion access, and fixing the broken mental healthcare system. He has been endorsed by Virginia’s top abortion access and women’s rights advocacy organizations, including REPRO Rising VA (formerly NARAL Pro-Choice VA) and the VA National Organization for Women PAC. Creigh has also earned endorsements from Gabby Giffords, her lifesaving organization Giffords PAC, and over 75+ other progressive groups and leaders.

In the State Senate, Creigh presides as the Chair of the Commerce and Labor Committee and serves on several other committees. He is the second highest ranking member of the State Senate, making him a powerful advocate for our priorities in the legislature.

Creigh lives in Charlottesville with his wife Siobhan and their three rescue pups: Mila, Dilly, and SallyMae. He is the proud father of four children and four beautiful grandchildren.
