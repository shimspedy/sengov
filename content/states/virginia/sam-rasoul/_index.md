Salam "Sam" Rasoul (born June 30, 1981) is an American politician serving as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from the 38th district. He is one of the two Muslim members of the Virginia General Assembly. In November 2020, Rasoul announced his candidacy for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in 2021.

Early Life and Education :
Rasoul was born in Warren, Ohio in 1981, the son of Palestinian immigrants. He earned a Bachelor of Business Administration from Roanoke College and a Master of Business Administration from Hawaii Pacific University.

Political Career :
Rasoul first ran for elected office in 2008 when he challenged incumbent Republican Bob Goodlatte for Virginia's 6th Congressional seat. Although he lost to Goodlatte by 25 percentage points in the heavily Republican district, Rasoul's commitment to public service continued.

He was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in a special election held on January 7, 2014, filling the vacancy created by the November 2013 resignation of Delegate Onzlee Ware. After winning the Democratic primary by 44 votes, Rasoul secured nearly 70% of the vote over his Republican opponent Octavia Johnson in the general election. He officially took office on January 8, 2014.

Rasoul is a member of the Legislative Black Caucus and the Rural Caucus in the House of Delegates. He also ran as a candidate in the 2021 Virginia lieutenant gubernatorial election, although he ultimately lost to Hala Ayala. If nominated, he would have been the first Muslim candidate to run statewide anywhere in the South and the first Virginia statewide nominee from Roanoke since Ray Garland, who ran for U.S. Senate in 1971.

Personal Life :
Rasoul and his wife, Layaly, have three children.
