Originally born in Denver, Colorado, Michael has called Virginia home for over twenty years. He moved to Fauquier County in 1999 where his mothers’ family has called home since the early 1930s.

Michael is a family man, a farmer, and a business owner. He and his lovely wife Rebecca reside in Warrenton, VA with their two young sons. Michael is a graduate of George Mason University where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in Communications.

After being a radio producer and briefly working in the landscaping industry, Michael went back to his roots (His great grandfather Crane was an Angus breeder in the 50s) and his first business which was in Agriculture. He began managing his family farm, Locust Hill Farm, in 2007. Following the passing of his beloved grandmother, Maggie Bryant, in 2021 the farming operation transitioned to Black Locust Livestock.

Owned by Mike and his wife, Black Locust Livestock expanded to include The Store at Locust Hill where they sell their own beef and products while showcasing other local producers.  Black Locust Livestock is an Angus and Hereford cattle seedstock producer and sell bulls nationwide. Fields of corn and soybeans are a common view along with pastures filled with the animals both Michael and his wife love.

After having met Rebecca while she was the Virginia Angus Association’s Executive Director, it became abundantly clear they had more in common than just a love of cattle. Rebecca and Michael were married in 2011.

Michael and Rebecca are also co-owners of Black Locust Livestock Marketing and Consulting; a part-time business that works to help other livestock producers market their livestock and develop strategies in today’s competitive environment.

Michael’s roots run deep in the agricultural community. His great grandfather came to Virginia in the early 30s, and his family has been active in the community ever since. Michael currently sits on the board of the Fauquier Livestock Exchange, which is only fitting as his grandfather was an original stockholder.

Michael and his family have strong ties to the environment and conservation. Being a farmer, Michael believes we must treat the land with respect. Michael has led by example as Locust Hill Farm was awarded the Conservation Farm Award in 2010 by John Marshall Soil and Water Conservation District of which Michael is now an Associate Director.

Michael also serves on the Rappahannock River Basin Commission and State Water Commission where he has been a champion for the Chesapeake Bay – in 2015 he was awarded the Chesapeake Bay Foundation Legislator of the year. He has also sponsored and passed legislation that will help the Commonwealth reach its Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) goals that are included in the Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan for the Commonwealth.

Michael is a proven leader in our community. Since first being elected in 2011, he has passed several pieces of legislation. From reducing red-tape, cutting taxes, fighting for our Second Amendment rights, protecting the unborn, and promoting conservation practices that protect our environment, Michael has a proven track record of bipartisan accomplishments in the General Assembly and is honored to  continue serving the people of the 61st District.
