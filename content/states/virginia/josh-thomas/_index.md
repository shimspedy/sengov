Josh Thomas was born and raised in a small town where most folks, including Josh’s family, worked for the airlines. They instilled in him a deep commitment to community service, and his brother, a Marine, showed him the dedication and sacrifice required to serve our nation.
When the tragedy of September 11th shook the world, even Josh’s small town felt the impact. His community’s safety and sense of security were shattered. So, he answered the call to make a difference in the world and joined the Marine Corps, training at Officer Candidates School in Quantico right here in Prince William County. In the Corps, Josh led Marines on tours in Afghanistan and the Middle East. However, his journey wasn’t just about fighting battles; it was about discovering a passion for service that would shape his life.

After five years of serving his country on active duty, Josh traded his combat boots for books and the pursuit of justice. At the College of William and Mary, he learned how to use the law to help small businesses, build homes and defend those that need it most. (In addition to acquiring a legal education, Josh also had the good fortune of meeting his now-wife Mahlet while they were law students together at William and Mary.) As an attorney, Josh set his sights on uplifting communities, ensuring affordable housing for all, and helping entrepreneurs and small businesses across Virginia thrive.

When the COVID-19 pandemic plunged the world into chaos again, Josh refused to stand idly by. He answered the call to serve yet again, joining Virginia’s Medical Reserve Corps to help combat the health and economic impacts of the disease.

Josh continues to fight for us every day by advocating for the rights of Veterans, the LGBTA+ community, and helping to secure asylum for those fleeing from Afghanistan. Josh refuses to back down, relentlessly working to bring about positive change.

As a United States Marine, Josh knows that teamwork is vital to completing any mission. That’s why he understands that the only way to get things done is by bringing people together, regardless of party affiliation.

He’s running to represent Virginia’s 21st District because he knows that Virginia’s working families need a champion who will fight for their rights and future. Josh is a leader who knows the true meaning of service. He answered the call to fight for our country after 9/11, braved the dangers of the pandemic as a member of the Virginia Reserve Medical Corps, and has fought for the underserved as an attorney. Now his sights are set on a new mission – representing our community in the Virginia House of Delegates.

Just as he did in the Marines, Josh Thomas is ready to stand tall and face challenges head-on. He will both lead and listen to solve the hard economic problems that we face and make Virginia a place where every family can thrive. Josh served our country as a Marine. He served our Commonwealth as part of the Virginia Medical Reserve Corps. Now, Josh is ready to begin his second service by serving our community as Delegate from District 21.
