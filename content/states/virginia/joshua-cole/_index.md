Joshua Cole served as a state Delegate representing the Fredericksburg area in the General Assembly. He is a local pastor, husband and father of two. Josh’s faith and commitment to service guided him as a delegate in bringing back historic investments in our schools, public safety, transportation infrastructure and better access to quality affordable healthcare. Now, he is running in HD-65 to fight for abortion rights and build an economy that works for all Virginians.

In 2019, Josh Cole became the youngest person and the first Black person elected from the Fredericksburg region to the General Assembly. In 2021, he lost the district by less than a 1,000 votes in a difficult off-year election.

In Richmond, Delegate Cole has taken a people first approach to law making. In his first term, he voted to cap out of pocket health care costs on prescription drugs for Virginians with pre-existing conditions, raise the minimum wage, expand voting rights and make community college tuition free.

Delegate Cole has taken on big issues, voting in support of the ERA, protecting workers’ rights, defending a woman’s right to choose, and protecting our environment by standing up to big polluters. He also took the lead on historic legislation, including renaming Jefferson Davis Highway to Emancipation Highway and bringing automatic voter registration to Virginia.
Now, he is running for HD-65 to return to the General Assembly and continue his work on behalf of Fredericksburg area families. He’s continuing to fight for affordable housing and jobs, public education, and transportation.

Outside of politics, Joshua is a Pastor, an avid Star Wars and Marvel fan, and a husband and father dedicated to making the Fredericksburg area better for working-class citizens, parents, the next generation and attracting more businesses that pay well.
