Christopher Scott Runion, an American politician, has made significant contributions to Virginia’s political landscape. Born in 1958, Runion grew up on a farm in the picturesque Shenandoah Valley. His journey from rural roots to public service exemplifies dedication and commitment.

After completing his accounting degree at Virginia Tech, Runion married and settled in Bridgewater. His passion for education led him to pursue an MBA from James Madison University. Armed with both practical experience and academic knowledge, Runion embarked on a career that would shape his community and state.

Runion’s involvement extended beyond the classroom. He actively participated in various regional councils, demonstrating his commitment to civic engagement. Additionally, he worked on several local Republican political campaigns, gaining valuable insights into the political process.

In 2019, Runion launched his campaign for the 25th district in the Virginia House of Delegates. His decision followed incumbent Republican Steve Landes’s announcement that he would not seek re-election, opting instead to run for the Clerk of Court for Augusta County. Runion secured the Republican primary victory and faced Democrat Jennifer Kitchen in the general election. His campaign resonated with voters, resulting in a decisive win with 58.1% of the vote1.

As a representative, Runion continues to champion conservative principles and prioritize constituent services. His business acumen and dedication to public welfare define his tenure in the Virginia General Assembly.
