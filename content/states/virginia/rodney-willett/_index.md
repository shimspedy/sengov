A Virginia native who grew up in a family of teachers, Rodney has dedicated his career to public service. Rodney attended the College of William and Mary where he earned both his undergraduate and law degrees. As an attorney, Rodney represented local governments in Virginia and he learned firsthand what good governance can look like and the positive impact that it can bring to working families. He was also instrumental in establishing and expanding free legal assistance programs while practicing.

In the late ’90s, Rodney saw the potential for technology to transform government and led Virginia Interactive, a public/private partnership with the Commonwealth to move information and citizen/business services online, helping put Virginia at the forefront of the Internet revolution. He has continued to work as a small business entrepreneur and technology consultant and currently helps organizations solve their business problems by unlocking the value of data. His most recent companies have been structured to maximize their community impact by providing financial and pro bono consulting support to area nonprofits.

Rodney was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 2019 and re-elected to second and third terms in 2021 and 2023. Representing the 58th House District encompassing most of western Henrico County, he has been instrumental in passing laws related to healthcare access, health workforce recruitment, early childhood educational opportunities, mental health programs, environmental protection, voting rights, prescription drug costs, and gun violence prevention. The Virginia Chamber of Commerce recognized him as the freshman legislator of the year in 2020 for his support of Virginia businesses.

Rodney serves on the House Appropriations Committee where he chairs the Compensation and Retirement Subcommittee, the Health and Human Services Committee where he chairs the Behavioral Health Subcommittee, and the Agriculture, Chesapeake Bay, and Natural Resources Committee. He is the chair of the Joint Commission on Health Care, chair of the Virginia Health Workforce Development Authority, and chair of the House Select Committee on Advancing Rural and Small Town Health Care. Rodney also serves on the Virginia Broadband Advisory Authority, Behavioral Health Commission, and VCU Health System Authority Board. Rodney formerly was a legislative appointee to the Virginia Foundation for Healthy Youth, New College Institute, Virginia Small Business Commission, and Advisory Committee on Juvenile Justice.

In addition to serving others in his professional and legislative career, Rodney is a current or former member of numerous community boards and committees, including Family Lifeline, Rx Partnership, Richmond Performing Arts Alliance, Virginia’s Children’s Health Insurance Advisory Board, and the Nature Foundation at Wintergreen. He is a former member of the Student Engagement and Leadership Advisory Board at the College of William and Mary where he founded the Pulley Family Endowment in order to fund public service work by student volunteers worldwide. Through his work and volunteer activities, Rodney has dedicated his life to making a difference for others.
