Serving as Delegate since 2016, Paul Krizek is a proud native of Mount Vernon. After graduating from Burgundy Farm Country Day School, Stephen Foster Jr. High School (now Walt Whitman Middle School), Groveton High School (West Potomac H.S.), the University of Virginia, and the Columbus School of Law at Catholic University in Washington, D.C., he has dedicated his life and career to community service and progressive values here in Mt. Vernon and in Virginia. Paul's work as a nonprofit executive has demonstrated his passion for helping people and advocating for those who cannot advocate for themselves. As our delegate, he is an effective and progressive leader: a 'work horse,' not a 'show horse,' who makes a real difference for Northern Virginia.

Paul was Congressman Jim Moran's first immigration constituent service staffer and then served as his legislative aide for eight years.  In 1998, Paul became the first Executive Director of Running Strong for American Indian Youth®, an Alexandria-based Native-led organization dedicated to helping Native American youth across the country realize their dreams.

Since 1999, Paul has served as Chief Counsel and Vice President for Christian Relief Services Charities, Inc., helping to manage a $50 million dollar international humanitarian organization that locally provides homes for abused women and children, the handicapped and the homeless, with a staff of 78. It's headquartered in Mount Vernon, on the Richmond Highway corridor in the heart of the 44th House of Delegates District, yards from the old Mt. Vernon High School.

Paul is an active member at St. Luke's Episcopal Church. He is also a board member of Mount Vernon at Home, an organization to support the lifetime independence of Mount Vernon seniors allowing them to age in place in their homes.  He was also appointed by Governors Warner and Kaine as a trustee of the Family and Children’s Trust Fund of Virginia.

Paul has played an active role in local, state and national Democratic politics.  He served for more than a decade on the State Central Committee of the Democratic Party of Virginia and on the 8th Congressional District Democratic Committee.  Paul chaired the Mount Vernon Democratic Committee and the Fairfax County Democratic Committee. He has been an active volunteer on countless Democratic campaigns since 1988, and was a Delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, 1996.

Paul, his wife, Tracey Navratil, and their daughter, Khloe Krizek, are fortunate to live in Paul's childhood home on Whiteoaks Drive in the Hollin Hills neighborhood of Mount Vernon.  His daughter recently graduated from West Potomac High School, his alma mater.
