Scott Anthony Surovell, born on August 21, 1971, in Washington, D.C., is an American lawyer and politician. He currently serves as a member of the Virginia Senate, representing the 34th district. This district encompasses portions of Fairfax, roughly following U.S. Route 1, Kingstowne, and Lorton. Prior to redistricting in 2023, he also represented the 36th district, which included portions of Prince William and Stafford counties, and earlier, the 44th district in the Virginia House of Delegates.

Surovell's journey into politics began during his college years at James Madison University, where he was student body vice-president. After graduating in 1993 with a major in Political Science, he went on to earn a J.D. degree from the University of Virginia School of Law. During law school, he served as the executive editor of the Virginia Journal of Environmental Law.

As a trial lawyer, Surovell specializes in criminal and traffic defense, domestic relations, personal injury, consumer class action, and commercial litigation. In 2002, he co-founded the law firm Surovell Markle Isaacs and Levy PLC, which focused on representing individuals and small businesses throughout Northern Virginia. Notably, he argued his first case before the Supreme Court of Virginia at the age of 28, involving a fraud claim related to the sale of a used car.

Beyond his legal career, Surovell has been actively involved in public service. He served as a Governor's Fellow in the administration of Governor L. Douglas Wilder in 1993. Additionally, he interned for Representative Jim Moran of Virginia and then-congressman Ron Wyden of Oregon in Washington, D.C.

In 2007, Surovell successfully blocked an insurance company from paying life insurance proceeds to a man convicted of killing his wife. This case led to modifications in the Virginia Slayer Statute during the 2008 General Assembly Session.

Surovell's commitment to justice extends beyond the courtroom. He won a $4.80-million jury verdict in favor of a Vienna family who suffered permanent injuries in a fireworks accident in the Town of Vienna in 2010.

As a Democrat, Surovell continues to advocate for his constituents and work towards positive change in Virginia. His dedication to public service and legal expertise make him a prominent figure in state politics.
