Atoosa Reaser’s family fled Iran during a revolution that took freedom away from many, especially women. They wanted to ensure she could grow up in a free country, where she would have equal access to education and equal opportunity in the workforce.

Atoosa has never forgotten what her parents sacrificed to ensure she could be free to pursue her dreams. She worked hard to graduate from George Mason University Law School, chose a career in public service, and has made it her mission to give back to the community that has given her so much.

For over 20 years, Atoosa has called Loudoun County home. Atoosa represents the 27th District, encompassing, Eastern Loudoun in the Virginia House of Delegates and previously served on the School Board representing the Algonkian District. Additionally she has been a leader on the PTA, a substitute teacher, a merit badge counselor for her son’s Scouts BSA troop, and a volunteer for LINK Against Hunger.

Currently, Atoosa is a member of the Virginia State Bar, the Loudoun Bar Association, and the Virginia Women Attorneys Association. She served as Deputy Town Attorney for the Town of Herndon, as a general practice litigator in a small firm, and as Associate General Counsel for a company of over 800 employees. In addition, Atoosa has been qualified by the Virginia Supreme Court as a guardian ad litem, which is an attorney who advocates for the best interest of children.

Through all her time as an attorney and serving her community, Atoosa never thought she’d see a day when Americans would lose their freedoms. Sadly, women, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and others are seeing their rights taken away. That’s why Atoosa decided to run for House of Delegates – to make sure every Virginian still has the same freedom and opportunity that brought her family to America in the first place.
