Vivian Edna Watts, a dedicated Democrat, has been serving in the Virginia House of Delegates for several decades. Her commitment to public service and her tireless efforts have left a lasting impact on her constituents and the state as a whole.

## Early Career and Legislative Service

Vivian Watts was first elected to the House of Delegates in 1981, representing the 39th district, which includes part of Fairfax County. During her initial term, she quickly gained recognition as a promising legislator. Her dedication to her constituents and her ability to work across party lines earned her the title of "Most Promising Freshman."

However, Watts left the House in 1986 to take on a new challenge. She accepted the position of Virginia Secretary of Transportation and Public Safety. In this role, she oversaw various state agencies, including Transportation, Corrections, State Police, Motor Vehicles, and more. Her experience in transportation and public safety would later inform her legislative work.

Notably, she has been a ranking minority member of several key committees, including Courts of Justice, Finance, and Science & Technology. Her bills have been signed into law, impacting issues ranging from mental health to transportation accountability.

## Personal Life and Community Involvement

Vivian Watts is not only a legislator but also a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother. She and her husband, Dave, moved to Virginia in 1963, where Dave began a 40-year federal career as an attorney for the National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife. They raised two children, Cindy and Jeff, both of whom have pursued successful careers.

Delegate Watts has also been actively involved in community organizations. She served as the Executive Director of Fairfax CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates), advocating for abused and neglected children.
