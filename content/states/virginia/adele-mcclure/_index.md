Adele McClure, a Democrat politician from Virginia, has dedicated her life to advocating for justice, equality, and vulnerable populations. Let's delve into her remarkable journey:

## Early Life and Education

Adele's upbringing on Richmond Highway in Northern Virginia shaped her commitment to social justice. She experienced poverty and periodic homelessness, which ignited her passion for advocating for those facing similar challenges. As the daughter of a resilient early childhood educator and a Filipino immigrant who served in the U.S. Army, Adele's diverse background fuels her determination to break down systemic barriers.

She became the first in her family to attend college, earning a B.S. in economics from Virginia Commonwealth University. Her student leadership as the Student Body President at VCU laid the foundation for her future advocacy work.

## Advocacy and Leadership

Adele's community activism and lived experiences led her to collaborate with advocates, stakeholders, and members of the Virginia General Assembly. Together, they drafted, passed, and implemented legislation to improve access to services and expand human rights. Adele's policy expertise and experience in both the state legislative and executive branches uniquely position her to make an impact from day one.

Notably, Adele serves as the Executive Director of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus (VLBC), where she shapes the VLBC's annual legislative agenda. Her leadership garnered national recognition when she was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 List for Law & Policy in 2019. Additionally, she received the National Black Legislative Staff Leadership Council Top 22 of 2022 award.

## Community Engagement

Adele's commitment extends beyond politics. She has been a long-time Arlington community leader and civic volunteer. Her involvement includes:

- **Arlington Continuum of Care Leadership Board:** Adele has served on this board for nearly a decade, working to address housing insecurity and homelessness.
- **Arlington Community Services Board (CSB):** Appointed six years ago, Adele oversees services provided by the Department of Human Services to individuals challenged by mental health, developmental and intellectual disabilities, substance use, and co-occurring disorders.

## Breaking Barriers

Adele McClure's historic election to the Virginia House of Delegates makes her the first Black person and the first Asian person to represent Arlington County. Her dedication to justice, equity, and progress continues to shape Virginia's legislative landscape.
