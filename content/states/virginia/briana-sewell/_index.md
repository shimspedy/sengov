Briana Sewell is a lifelong Virginian, born and raised in Prince William County. She is the daughter of high school sweethearts from Selma, Alabama, who moved to Virginia while serving in the Air Force. Her mother and father honorably served our nation as members of the United States Air Force for over 20 years. From a young age, Briana’s parents instilled in her the importance of integrity and service to others. After being stationed in the Republic of Panama for three years, Briana and her family returned to Woodbridge, Virginia—the place she has always called home.

Briana is a proud product of Prince William County Public Schools, where she excelled in the classroom and on the soccer field. Upon graduation from high school, she earned a Bachelor’s degree in Public Policy from the College of William and Mary and a Master’s degree in Public Administration from American University.

Instead of taking a corporate job in a big city after college, Briana made the conscious decision to move back to Prince William County and dedicate her life to strengthening the community through public service. She first served as Prince William County District Director for Congressman Gerry Connolly, leading the office in local community engagement, and providing strong constituent services.

In 2018, Briana helped establish the Virginia Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy, where she worked to bring people together to support bipartisan policies that benefit working families. These policies included paid family and medical leave, lower-cost child-care, affordable college and job training programs, and more affordable eldercare options. Briana remains passionate about these policies to this day. She knows when working families have the support they need, the entire economy benefits.

When Briana ran for Delegate in 2021, many declared the competitive district unwinnable. Despite the odds, Briana was elected and became one of the youngest women ever to serve in state Government. As a Delegate, Briana quickly became one of the most productive first-term members – passing legislation that was rooted in the stories she heard from around her district: laws increasing support for military families and veterans, adding more teachers to the classroom, and expanding protections for child victims of sexual assault. Every bill passed with bipartisan support.

Briana has been listening to people’s concerns throughout her service. She understands the issues her neighbors care about because she has witnessed them and lived through them. Briana’s commitment to serving the residents of the Commonwealth of Virginia has not gone unnoticed. She was recently recognized as one of twenty up-and-coming elected and appointed officials from across the country who not only exemplify strong leadership skills but have demonstrated a true commitment to service.

Briana is running for Congress to represent and amplify regular people’s voices in Washington. She will fight for both the kitchen table concerns that are top-of-mind for Virginians every day, the right for women to make their own health care decisions, the right to vote, and for other fundamental rights politicians have tried to take away.
