Dan lives in Fairfax County with his wife, Karen, a public school teacher, and their two sons. He is a West Point graduate, served tours in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Korea, and remains a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve. Dan has fought his entire life for our freedoms and our safety, and he is running for re-election to the House of Delegates in the new 10th District to continue fighting to keep our communities safe.

As Delegate, Dan is a champion for his constituents in Richmond. He delivers for Virginians by protecting access to affordable healthcare and safe and legal abortions, passing common-sense gun reform, and protecting our democracy from extremists.
