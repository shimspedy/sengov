Will Morefield grew up in Tazewell County to a multi-generation coalmining family.  He attended and graduated Tazewell County Schools and was raised in a Christian home, learning at an early age the strong values that makes Southwest Virginia great.
Even though Will Morefield is one of the youngest delegates at 33, he is a senior member in the House who proudly represents the counties of Bland, Buchanan, Russell, and Tazewell.  This gives him a strong and unique voice in Richmond for our area. As delegate, Will was the first elected official to publicly stand up for coal.  As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, he advocates for coal and natural gas jobs and has initiated Project Jonah, which will be the largest aquaculture project in the world - creating hundreds of jobs right here in Southwest Virginia. As a member of the Counties, Cities and Town Committee, Will successfully fights for teacher pay raises and for expanding infrastructure and drinking water projects.
Will is married to his wife April and they recently welcomed their beautiful daughter Kennedy into the world.  Will and April Morefield both refuse to see Kennedy grow up in an area with few opportunities to succeed.  This is why Will Morefield will continue to fight for a regional authority that will attract new industry to our region.  He will continue to stand up for the coalminers, farmers and teachers who are the bedrock of our community.  Will Morefield will continue to fight for Southwest Virginia because the hardworking people of the 3rd District deserve the hardest working delegate in Richmond!
