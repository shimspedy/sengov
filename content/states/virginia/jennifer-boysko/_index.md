Jennifer Boysko’s commitment to public service and advocacy for her community spans decades. Born in Arkansas and raised primarily in Alabama by her single mother who escaped poverty and abuse, Jennifer learned the importance of standing up for what’s right and giving back to the community from an early age.

She moved to Virginia in 1985 to attend Hollins University, the same alma mater as Emily’s List founder Ellen Malcolm, where she became an activist for reproductive rights. After graduating, Jennifer began her career on Capitol Hill, working for then-Democratic Senator Richard Shelby. In 2003, she became the Virginia State Director for Howard Dean’s presidential campaign, working alongside future Congressman Don Beyer and Representative Bobby Scott.

Her experience in political organizing led her to manage a campaign for the House of Delegates in 2007, where she shocked political insiders by coming within 5 points of victory against a 12-year Republican incumbent. In 2013, she ran herself, coming within 32 votes of defeating the incumbent in a recount. Undeterred, she ran again in 2015 and won, even though her challenger outspent her by $300,000.

As a freshman Delegate, Jennifer took on the responsibility of Fundraising Chair and started the “Run Everywhere” initiative to help raise money for challengers. Her efforts helped win 15 new seats in the House of Delegates.

In 2019, newly elected Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton endorsed Jennifer to succeed her in the State Senate. Jennifer won a special election to represent half of Loudoun County in a super-sized State Senate District that would eventually be split in two. Since joining the State Senate, Jennifer has continued to break records and make history. She became the first freshman and only the fifth Senator ever to raise $1 million for Senate Democrats as Finance Chair. In the Senate, she has taken on and won Virginia’s toughest fights for women, families, and the LGBTQ community.
