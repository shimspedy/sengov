Betsy has dedicated her career to serving our community. In addition to serving as a delegate, Betsy served for 16 years as outreach director at St. Paulâ€™s Episcopal Church in downtown Richmond. She is a founder and past director of the Micah Initiative, which involves over 120 faith communities in partnerships with twenty-five city elementary schools, providing 1,700 mentors, tutors, and volunteers.

Betsy ran for the Richmond School Board because she knows that a strong public education is the road to success. After serving on the School Board, she realized she could have a greater impact and make a bigger difference to improve lives by serving in the General Assembly. She then ran for the House of Delegates so she could make a difference in schools, in health care, in criminal justice reform, in combating climate change, and creating fairness and justice for all.

Delegate Betsy B. Carr, a proud Democrat, represents the 69th House of Delegates district, serving portions of the City of Richmond in the Virginia House of Delegates.
