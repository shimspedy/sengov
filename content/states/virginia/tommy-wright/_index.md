Early Life and Education
Thomas C. "Tommy" Wright, Jr. was born on April 27, 1948, in Richmond, Virginia. He attended Victoria High School, where he graduated in 1966. His passion for politics led him to pursue a B.A. degree in political science from Old Dominion University, which he earned in 1970.

Political Career
County Board of Supervisors
Wright's political journey began when he was elected to the Lunenburg County Board of Supervisors in 1993. His commitment to public service was evident as he secured re-election in 1997 and even served as the board's chairman from 1995 to 1997.

Virginia House of Delegates
In 2000, tragedy struck when State Senator Richard J. Holland passed away. The responsibility fell upon 61st district Delegate Frank Ruff, who won a special election on November 7, 2000, to fill the vacant seat. Wright, receiving the Republican nomination, emerged victorious in another special election on December 19, 2000, succeeding Ruff.

Since then, Tommy Wright has been a steadfast representative for the 50th district, which encompasses Southside Virginia counties—Amelia, Cumberland, Mecklenburg, Nottoway—and part of Lunenburg County. His affiliation with the Republican Party has shaped his legislative priorities and commitment to his constituents.

Committee Work
Throughout his tenure, Wright has actively participated in various House committees:
- Agriculture (2001)
- Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources (2002–present)
- Claims (2001)
- Conservation and Natural Resources (2001)
- Counties, Cities, and Towns (2001)
- General Laws (2002–present)
- Militia and Police (2001)
- Militia, Police, and Public Safety (2002–present)

## Notable Stances
Wright's voting record reflects his conservative values. For instance, he opposed a bill aiming to eliminate a law banning sexual intercourse before marriage during the 2020 legislative session. Despite bipartisan support, Wright stood firm in his convictions.
