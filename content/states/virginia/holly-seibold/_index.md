Holly moved to Washington, D.C. to pursue an undergraduate degree from American University, where she graduated with a B.A. in Communications, Law, Economics & Government. While at AU, Holly worked on Capitol Hill, the State Department, and the American Embassy of London.

Aspiring to make an even greater impact in the world, Holly returned to college seeking a Master's degree in Education. Holly graduated from The George Washington University with a M.Ed. in Elementary Education in 2003.  Always learning, Holly has enrolled in multiple personal and professional development programs over the last decade, including a six month Emerge candidate training program.

Holly began her career in the nonprofit sector before becoming an educator in the public school system. Transitioning from the classroom to a small business owner in 2010, Holly launched a successful educational firm, offering STEM consulting services and educational programs to clients. In 2015, Holly launched the non-profit organization, BRAWS, to help women and girls obtain menstrual supplies and undergarments. Through her advocacy efforts, women and girls in schools, shelters, and prisons/jails throughout Virginia can now access supplies free of charge and tax-free.

Holly was named the 2017 Emerging Influential Leader of the Year by the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce, the Rising Star Heroine of the 2017 Heroines of Washington Awards, the 2020 DAR Community Service Award, designated a Citation of Merit from the Fairfax County Federation of Citizens Associations 2020 Citizen of the Year, and the 2022 Martin Luther King Jr., The Spirit of King Award from the First Baptist Church of Vienna. 

Holly and her husband, Erik, a software engineer, have raised their two children in the Town of Vienna, where they have lived since 2012. A leader in her community, Holly has volunteered in a number of capacities including Vienna Elementary School PTA, Madison High School PTSA,  Vienna Little League, Vienna Girls Softball League, the Westwood and Machine Swim Teams, Northern Virginia Community College Advisory Board, Vienna Business Association Board Member, the Fairfax County Community Action Board, and the Virginia Council on Women. She has also been a proud escort of the Washington Area Clinic Defense Task Force, an all-volunteer group dedicated to safe access to reproductive health clinics.
