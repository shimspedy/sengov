Danica A. Roem is an American journalist and politician who has served in the Virginia Senate since 2024. A Democrat, she represents the 30th district, which covers part of Prince William County, including the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park.

Early Life and Education:
Roem was born at Prince William Hospital and raised in Manassas, Virginia. Her father died by suicide when she was three years old, and her maternal grandfather, Anthony Oliveto, acted as a father figure. She attended Loch Lomond Elementary School and All Saints School before going to Paul VI Catholic High School in Fairfax, Virginia. Later, she pursued journalism at St. Bonaventure University in New York.

Career and Achievements:
As a student at St. Bonaventure, Roem initially struggled academically but made a comeback, earning a 3.48 GPA and making the Dean's List. Her professors described her as tenacious and persistent, advocating for those whose voices were often ignored.

Roem's professional journey included working as a journalist, news editor, and executive director. In 2017, she was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, becoming the first openly transgender person to serve in a state legislature in U.S. history. In 2023, she was elected to the Virginia Senate, achieving another historic milestone as the first openly transgender person to be elected to a state senate in the Southern United States.

Her role models growing up were Senator Chuck Colgan and Delegate Harry Parrish, who had independent ideologies despite party affiliations.

Danica A. Roem continues to make history and advocate for inclusivity and representation in politics.
