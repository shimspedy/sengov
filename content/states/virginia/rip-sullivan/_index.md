Richard C. “Rip” Sullivan, Jr. and his wife, Beth are Langley High School sweethearts.

Having lived in McLean for nearly 50 years, McLean, Great Falls, Vienna, and the other parts of the new 6th District have long been home to them. Beth and Rip have four adult children, all of whom graduated from Fairfax County public schools, and four grandchildren.

Rip graduated magna cum laude from Amherst College, and received his law degree from the University of Virginia. He is a partner in the law firm Bean Kinney & Korman, P.C., in Arlington.

As a Delegate, Rip has fought every year to defend reproductive freedom, encourage the growth of Virginia’s clean energy and energy efficiency sectors, promote access to the ballot box, protect and advance LGBTQ rights, address the gun violence epidemic, and expand healthcare access. Speaker Filler-Corn appointed Rip to serve as Chair of the powerful Labor and Commerce Committee’s Energy Subcommittee, a role in which he used his experience legislating in the energy space to help shape the way Virginia moves forward on these crucial issues. He also previously served as Chair of the Finance Committee’s Subcommittee which considers bills related to corporate and individual income tax. Currently, Rip serves on the Commerce and Energy Committee, the Courts of Justice Committee, and the Finance Committee. He is looking forward to continuing to address these issues on behalf of the 6th District.

Rip is an experienced leader, with proven results. During the 2020 General Assembly session Rip introduced the historic Virginia Clean Economy Act to battle climate change and advance the Commonwealth’s clean energy sector and promote energy efficiency. He also was the author and patron of Virginia’s life-saving “Red Flag” law, which stops gun violence before a single shot is fired. In 2021, he was the Chief Co-Patron of the Clean Cars bill, which launched Virginia’s effort to up its game and increase the pace of our switch to electric vehicles. In 2019, he was the author of “Jacob’s Law,” which strengthens surrogacy rights for gay and straight couples (as well as single parents) who want to start a family in Virginia. Rip worked diligently with stakeholders and his colleagues to ensure that these landmark bills all became law.

Before being elected to the House of Delegates, Rip served our region on numerous boards and commissions, providing him with extensive experience in a number of key policy areas that have directly translated to his work in the General Assembly. He is looking forward to earning the confidence and support of the constituents of the newly drawn 6th House of Delegates district.
