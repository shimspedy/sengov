Born and raised in Saltville, VA, Jed has spent his entire life in Southwest Virginia. He graduated from Northwood High School in 1997 and from Radford University in '03. In 2012, he enrolled at the Appalachian School of Law. For three years Jed drove from Saltville to Grundy, VA five days a week for classes. In 2015, he graduated second in his class and passed the bar that same July. 

He now has a general practice law firm. From 2015 - 2023, he served as the legislative assistant to Delegate Jeff Campbell, drafting legislation, meeting stakeholders, and addressing constituent issues.

Jed was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates to represent the 6th District (Carroll County, Wythe County, and a portion of Smyth County) in a Special Election on August 29, 2023.  He was sworn into office on September 5, 2023.  He was re-elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in the new 46th District (includes all of Smyth, Grayson, and Wythe counties along with a portion of Pulaski County) on November 7, 2023.

Jed is a firm believer in the values of Southwest Virginia, our constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the right to life, lower taxes and smaller government. 

He still resides in Saltville with his wife, Melanie and their son, Jack.
