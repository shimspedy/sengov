Michael B. Feggans, a proud Virginian, has always called Virginia Beach home. Raised in the West Kempsville area, he grew up in a family dedicated to public service. His mother, a Norfolk Public School teacher, and his father, a retired Norfolk International Airport firefighter, instilled in him the values of community, hard work, and dedication.

Before graduating from high school, Michael knew that his future lay in the military. Enlisting in the U.S. Air Force in August 2001, he discovered his passion for healthcare and information technology. At Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, he not only honed his technical skills but also embraced community service. As a member of the Base Enlisted Advisory Council, he learned the importance of teamwork, community building, and collaboration.

 Political Engagement and International Service

Michael's journey into political engagement began during his time as one of the first enlisted active-duty Air Force Congressional interns. Assigned to Senator Mark Warner's Norfolk office, he worked closely with the Constituent Services team, learning the value of community relations and assisting citizens regardless of their political affiliation.

Deployed to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Michael led aeromedical evacuation operations for injured service members. He also worked with the State Department on community outreach initiatives, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy and collaboration.

Later, he provided deployment support to the Republic of Korea, overseeing a $50 million development project at the Gimhae Contingency Hospital. His leadership skills and commitment to service shone through as he managed a team responsible for serving over 500 patients.

 Returning Home and Political Advocacy

After returning home, stationed in Hampton Roads, Michael reconnected with his roots. He became actively involved with the Virginia Young Democrats and the Virginia Beach Democratic Committee. His progressive voice and dedication to community service led him to run for Delegate in the newly formed 97th House District.

As a former Congressional intern and Senior Enlisted Leader, Michael understands the importance of reaching across the aisle. His small business experience and commitment to serving his community make him a strong advocate for Virginia Beach residents.

Michael B. Feggans continues to serve his community with passion, integrity, and a vision for a better future. As a Delegate in the Virginia House of Delegates, he remains committed to building bridges, advocating for constituents, and making a positive impact on the lives of Virginians.
