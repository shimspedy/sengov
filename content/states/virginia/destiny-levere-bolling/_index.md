Born and raised in a small town on the Northern Neck of Virginia, Destiny knows what it’s like to live in a community where too many people feel overlooked or forgotten, and grow up in a community where people in leadership didn’t look like her. As a result, Destiny developed early on a desire to fight for change and a passion for service. She has spent her entire life since working to improve the lives of her community and Commonwealth.

Whether as an educator teaching students in underserved communities, volunteering at her local church, or as the Communications Director of the Virginia AFL-CIO where she advocated for hardworking Virginians, Destiny has seen firsthand the struggles families are facing. She knows the residents in the 80th House District and communities across the Commonwealth deserve a leader who will wake up every single day fighting to deliver real change.
