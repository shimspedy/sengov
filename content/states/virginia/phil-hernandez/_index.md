Phil is stepping up to serve the City of Norfolk in Virginia’s newly-created 94th District. Phil and his wife, Sara, are raising their family in Ocean View.

Phil was born and raised in Hampton Roads, attended local public schools, and received a Gates Millennium Scholarship, which made it possible for him to attend William & Mary and become the first in his family to graduate from college. He was determined to put that education to good use, to solve problems, and to serve others.

Currently, Phil is the Senior Vice President for Policy & Advocacy for a nonprofit organization. In this leadership role, Phil has been on the front lines fighting for solutions that benefit Virginia families, from raising the minimum wage to increasing teacher pay and funding K-12 public schools.

Previously, Phil served as a Senior Policy Analyst in President Obama’s White House Domestic Policy Council, where he partnered with leaders across the country to expand affordable clean energy, fight for clean air and water, and help coordinate the response to the BP Oil Spill, the worst spill in American history.

Phil has also worked as a civil rights attorney, a role that allowed him to bring together people from all walks of life in the name of creating better economic opportunities for all people.

In recent years, Phil helped pass laws in Virginia to increase the minimum wage, lower taxes for families, and support our local public schools. He will use his experience to bring people together and get things done.

Phil has always looked for creative ways to build community. He’s organized free classes in Norfolk to help locals learn American Sign Language (ASL). And when the baby formula shortage was at its peak in 2022, Phil created a new tool to help local families more easily find formula for their children. 

He met his wife, Sara, at William & Mary and they were married in 2015. Sara works to increase access to quality, affordable health care, with a special focus on preventive care. They have two beautiful daughters, Isa and Maia, who love growing up in Ocean View.
