Phillip Scott, an American politician and social media influencer, was born in Voorhees, New Jersey. Raised in both New Jersey and Maine, he eventually moved to Virginia during high school, where he has resided for nearly 25 years. His primary home has been in the Stafford, Spotsylvania, and Fredericksburg area.

Growing up in a Christian household, Phillip developed a passion for learning and serving. He actively participated in ministry, serving as a youth leader, assistant church planter, small group teacher, and nursery worker. His professional journey included management roles in the food service and customer service industries, as well as over a decade of experience in residential and commercial construction. Notably, he worked for a family-owned residential remodeling company based in Dumfries, VA, and a family-owned glass company located in Orange, VA.

In 2014, Phillip transitioned to working as a background investigator for the Federal Government. His leadership skills were quickly recognized, leading to promotions. Currently, he leads a team of background investigators for a government contractor and serves as the sole breadwinner for his household.

Phillip's educational journey reflects his commitment to lifelong learning. He attended Word of Life Bible Institute and later pursued degrees at Liberty University. His academic achievements include a Bachelor's degree in Biblical Studies, a Master's degree in Management and Leadership, a Juris Masters, and ongoing work toward a Ph.D. in Public Policy specializing in National Security.

An Eagle Scout, Phillip achieved this notable accomplishment within just two years of joining Boy Scouts shortly before his 16th birthday. His hobbies and interests span woodworking, craftsmanship, personal finance (he runs a YouTube channel with financial tips), working out, gardening, fishing, hiking, spending time outdoors with family, and honing his skills on the gun range.

Phillip's dream of fatherhood has come trueâ€”he is the proud father of five daughters, including a set of twins and a daughter with Edwards Syndrome. As a dad, he enjoys their playful moments, such as gathering around him to brush his hair, adorned with ribbons and bows. The family often takes walks in their quiet neighborhood or explores the surrounding national battlefield parks. Bike rides and outings to Old Town Fredericksburg are also cherished family activities.

In addition to his family life, Phillip has actively served his local community. He joined the Board of Directors of his Property Owners' Association (POA) and served two terms in various roles, including Treasurer and President. His dedication to preparing his three oldest daughters for the future drives his commitment to both family and community.

After two years of serving in the House of Delegates, Phillip's passion to serve has only grown stronger. He looks forward to continuing his service to Virginia by representing the 63rd district.
