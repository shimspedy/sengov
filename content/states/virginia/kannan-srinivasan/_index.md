Kannan Srinivasan immigrated from India in 1992, moved to Loudoun in 1999 and has lived here for over 20 years. As a finance and business leader, Kannan helped grow a small technology insurance business in Sterling into an industry pioneer that created thousands of jobs, and he helped navigate José Andrés’ restaurant group through the depths of the pandemic.

Kannan’s parents were proud school teachers who instilled the value of public service and a strong belief in education as an investment in our community’s future.

Kannan’s values come from experience. As a young man, he was hit by a truck and was denied Medicaid assistance for thousands of dollars. Now he is Chair of the Virginia Medicaid Board–and he helped to expand Medicaid to more than 2 million Virginians.

Background
Kannan served as Treasurer of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee for six years, and its finance chair for two years. He served as secretary of the Democratic Asian Americans of Virginia, Virginia’s AAPI caucus, for four years.

Kannan is an alumnus of the Sorensen Institute of Political Leadership at the University of Virginia (CTP 2018). As a community leader, Kannan worked with County Board of Supervisors on AAPI month proclamation for the first time in Loudoun.

Kannan lives in Loudoun County with his wife Jay. Jay is an alumna of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras and George Mason University, Virginia and is passionate about disability advocacy and cancer research.
