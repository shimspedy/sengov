Marcus Simon is a lifelong resident of Fairfax County, Virginia where he currently resides with his wife Rachel, and two children, Emily and Zachary.
 

Childhood: The Simon Family Goes to Washington

Marcus came to Washington in 1970 as an infant, the oldest child of Sam & Susan Simon. Sam was a freshly minted young lawyer who arrived in the Nation's Capital on a mission to change the world for the better. He went to work with consumer advocate Ralph Nader and his new Public Interest Research Group. Growing up the son of one of the original Nader's Raiders, Marcus was impressed early in life with the value of public service, and the importance of leaving the world a better place than he found it.

​

His mother Susan worked as a teacher, a learning disability specialist, and an elementary school counsellor in the Fairfax County Public Schools. The family, which quickly grew to include sister Rachael, lived in homes in Arlington, McLean and Falls Church in the 1970s and 80s. Before graduating from McLean High School in 1988, Marcus attended Longfellow Intermediate and both Kent Gardens and Haycock elementary.

Marcus spent his summers at Kent Gardens Recreation Club, where he was on both the Swim and Dive teams. He played McLean Youth Soccer, Basketball, T-ball and Track. He received his Varsity letter in swimming at McLean High School, where he also wrote many articles for the School paper.

Early Involvement in State & County Government
​
After returning from four years of College in 1992 with a Bachelor's degree in Middle East Studies and Journalism from NYU, Marcus went to work for Delegate James M. Scott as his first full time legislative aide. He rented a house in Pimmit Precinct which also served as the unofficial 53rd District local office. Marcus worked on Jim's 1993 re-election campaign and accompanied him to Richmond for the 1993 and 1994 legislative sessions. In 1995 Marcus went to work for then Providence District Supervisor, and candidate for Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, Katherine K. Hanley. He moved with Kate to the Government Center after her successful special election campaign, and remained on her staff for the next five years. In the fall of that year he began attending Law School at American University's Washington College of Law at night.
 

Military Service

Marcus left the Chairman's office after graduating law school in 1999 and receiving his Commission as an officer in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. Although he'd volunteered to spend his first year as JAG serving in Korea, his assignment was changed during the final days of his training in Charlottesville, and he was assigned to the Military District of Washington and Ft. Myer, in Arlington. As an Army Captain, Marcus served as a prosecutor where he handled officer misconduct cases and all criminal cases on Ft. Myer, Ft. McNair, and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He also served as a part time Special Assistance United States Attorney prosecuting civilians who committed crimes on federal military installations in the Washington area.

Marcus also provided legal support to the Emergency Operations Command Center on Ft. McNair during the days following the September 11, 2001 attack on the Pentagon.
 

Private Practice

Upon completion of his military commitment, Marcus entered private practice in 2003 working as a Real Estate attorney in downtown McLean. In 2008 Marcus co-founded the Law Firm of Leggett, Simon, Freemyers & Lyon and Ekko Title, a real estate settlement, title and escrow company. Ekko Title now employees over 40 people at its eight locations throughout Northern Virginia from Fredericksburg in the South to Reston and McLean in the North.
