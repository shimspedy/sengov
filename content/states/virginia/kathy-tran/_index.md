Kathy Tran and her family fled Vietnam as boat refugees when she was just seven months old. Although many other countries offered them asylum, they waited 13 months for the United States to accept their application. Her family risked everything to come to America because, for her parents, this country always represented hope, opportunity, and freedom. Now, Kathy is a mom of five kids, ages 2.5 to 14, and is running to represent the 18th House District to continue fighting for these values.

From her service in the Virginia House of Delegates to her time as a civil servant at the U.S. Department of Labor and her advocacy work at the National Immigration Forum, Kathy is committed to ensuring all families have the same opportunities that hers had to achieve their American Dream.

As a Delegate, she has introduced and supported bills to expand healthcare and reproductive rights, invest in public schools, reduce gun violence, increase affordable housing, expand voting access, support working families, preserve the environment, and make Virginia more welcoming and inclusive.

Kathy graduated from Duke University and earned her Master of Social Work from the University of Michigan. A past president of her local PTA, she and her husband Matt live in West Springfield with their five children, all avid Washington Nationals fans.
