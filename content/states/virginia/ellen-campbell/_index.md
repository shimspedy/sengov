From hearing the needs of the community at the Rockbridge County Fair, to attending legislative sessions with her late husband, Ronnie Campbell, Delegate Ellen Campbell was constantly at her husband’s side when he represented our District, and is ready to continue his legacy of public service.

A lifelong resident of Augusta and Rockbridge County, Ellen graduated from Fort Defiance High School. She later graduated cum laude with a B.S. in Business Administration from Averett University and The Virginia Bankers School of Bank Management at UVA-Darden.

Ellen worked in the banking industry as Vice President of Retail Banking, Branch Manager, Retail Lender. and most recently as a rural home and agricultural lender for Farm Credit of the Virginias. 

On the heels of the a successful Legislative Session this past winter, Delegate Ellen Campbell is continuing Ronnie’s work, putting our community first, lowering our taxes, ensuring parents are in control of their children’s education, supporting our law enforcement officers, and stopping infringements on our rights by radicals in Richmond. Ellen will continue to work for all of Augusta, Staunton, Waynesboro, and Rockbridge.
