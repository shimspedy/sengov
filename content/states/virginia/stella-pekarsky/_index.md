Stella Pekarsky, a lifelong Virginian with Greek roots, has dedicated her career to ensuring that future generations have opportunities to achieve success. Growing up in a working-class immigrant family, Stella learned the value of education early on. As the oldest daughter in her Greek-American household, she split her time between Greece and Virginia, ultimately finding her home in the United States.

Navigating two cultures and languages, Stella entered U.S. schools at the end of second grade, overcoming language barriers to pursue her education. She earned a bachelor's degree in Government & Politics from George Mason University, completing it within three years while working and seeking scholarships to cover her expenses.

Stella's commitment to education led her to become a teacher in Fairfax County Public Schools. She earned a Master's in Multicultural & Multilingual Education and certification as an ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) teacher. Stella and her husband chose Centreville as their home, where they are raising their six incredible children.

Beyond the classroom, Stella has been a tireless advocate for her community. In 2020, she was elected as the Sully District representative on the Fairfax County School Board. Her accomplishments include guiding the post-COVID return to in-person learning, enhancing access and resources for Advanced Academics, leading a national superintendent search, and ensuring every student in FCPS receives the support they need to excel.

Stella also stood up against Glenn Youngkin's attempt to strip local control from schools, demonstrating her commitment to empowering communities. Previously, she served as HOA President, President of several PTAs, taught adult ESOL classes, and worked with underserved youth through Cornerstones.

In 2018, Stella advocated for more recess for Virginians, successfully lobbying state legislators to change the law and provide developmentally appropriate recess for children. Her dedication to education, working families, and community service led her to the Virginia Senate, where she represents the 36th district in western Fairfax County.

Stella Pekarsky continues to fight for a brighter future, championing education, equity, and opportunity for all Virginians.
