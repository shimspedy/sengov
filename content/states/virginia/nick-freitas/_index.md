Nick Freitas is an American politician and social media influencer. Born on August 29, 1979, in Chico, California, he is of Portuguese ancestry. Freitas joined the United States Army after high school and later graduated from Henley-Putnam School of Strategic Security with a B.S. in Intelligence Management. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, he became a member of the U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Berets) and served two tours in Iraq. Honorably discharged in 2009, Freitas moved to Culpeper County, Virginia, in 2010.

In 2015, Freitas ran for the Virginia House of Delegates in the 30th district, succeeding Republican Ed Scott. Unopposed in both the Republican primary and general election, he took office in January 2016. The 30th district includes Madison County, Orange County, and the southern half of Culpeper County. He secured re-election in 2017 with 62% of the vote against Democrat Ben Hixon.

Freitas withdrew from the 2019 election for the House of Delegates but mounted a successful write-in campaign, winning with 57.89% of the vote. As a member of the House of Delegates, he serves on the Science and Technology, Militia, Police and Public Safety, and Finance committees.

In addition to his political career, Freitas has professional experience working for a veterans' services organization. His military background and commitment to public service continue to shape his work in Virginia politics.
