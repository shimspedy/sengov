Paul Vincent Milde III (born 1967) is an American politician. A Republican, he was elected to serve as the delegate of Virginia's 64th district in the 2023 Virginia House of Delegates election.

Career : Stafford Board of Supervisors
From 2006 to 2017, Milde served as the supervisor of the Aquia district on the Stafford County Board of Supervisors. He was first elected to the Board of Supervisors in 2005, defeating the incumbent, Kandy A. Hilliard. Milde remained in the position until 2017 when he declined to run again for supervisor, instead opting to run for the Virginia House of Delegates to represent Virginia's 28th district. Unfortunately, Milde did not win the 2017 Virginia House of Delegates election, losing in the Republican primary to Bob Thomas.

Milde persisted in his political aspirations. In an upset election, he defeated Thomas, now the sitting delegate, in the 2019 Republican primary, becoming the party's nominee for the 28th district. However, he ultimately lost to Democrat Joshua G. Cole in the general election.

Virginia House of Delegates
In November 2022, Milde announced his candidacy for the House of Delegates in the recently redistricted 64th district. The Republican primary for the race was canceled as Milde had no qualified opponents. He went on to defeat Democrat Leonard Lacey in the general election, securing his position as the delegate for the 64th district.

Milde's commitment to public service and his journey from local government to the state legislature demonstrate his dedication to representing the interests of his constituents.
