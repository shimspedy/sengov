Katrina Callsen's journey is deeply intertwined with Charlottesville, a place where her family's roots run deep despite a complex history. Originally drawn to the area for law school at UVA, Katrina discovered her family's nearby origins after her father's adoption story unraveled in 2016. This revelation shed light on how discriminatory laws of the past still reverberate through generations today.

Raised as a military child in a large enlisted family, Katrina's upbringing was marked by resilience in the face of financial struggles and the unwavering belief in the transformative power of education instilled by her parents. Her mother's pursuit of a bachelor's degree while juggling minimum-wage jobs served as a guiding light, reinforcing the value of perseverance and education.

After graduating from Yale University, where she supported herself through various jobs, Katrina embarked on a path driven by her passion for educational equity. Joining Teach For America/AmeriCorps, she taught middle school math in Lynn, Massachusetts, witnessing firsthand the challenges her students faced beyond the classroomâ€”issues like immigration concerns, employment obstacles, and the harsh realities of poverty.

Her experiences in the classroom ignited a passion for law, leading her to pursue a legal career focused on advocating for children in the legal system. Today, as Deputy City Attorney for Charlottesville and former Chair of the Albemarle County School Board, Katrina combines her legal expertise with her commitment to educational improvement and community empowerment. Her work reflects a steadfast dedication to addressing systemic challenges and ensuring that all students have the opportunity to thrive.

Katrina Callsen's story is one of resilience, advocacy, and a profound belief in the power of education to create positive change, making her a dedicated advocate in the Virginia House of Delegates.
