Jason Ballard is a husband, father, Veteran, attorney, and Delegate for the 42nd District of the Virginia House of Delegates. Jason was born in Giles County in the town of Pearisburg. He graduated from Concord College with a BA in Political Science and BS in Management, and then he attended West Virginia University for law school, where he also met his future wife, Catherine. Jason formerly served on the Pearisburg Town Council for several years.

While earning his law degree, the tragic events of September 11th, 2001 unfolded. Jason felt the call to serve his country more than ever, so he joined the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General’s (JAG) Corps upon graduation. He began his military career with the historic 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), and would deploy twice into combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. Jason would go on to command the JAG School’s Student Detachment in Charlottesville, and later become a member of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), famously known as the “Night Stalkers.” Jason served 2 more combat tours with the Night Stalkers in the Middle East. Jason is a decorated Army Officer having earned the Bronze Star, 4 Meritorious Service Medals, the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the German Armed Forces Badge of Military Proficiency, as well as the Pathfinder Badge, Parachutist Badge, the Air Assault Badge, and many more awards and accolades.  Jason also completed SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) school, which is widely regarded as one of the most physically and mentally challenging schools offered by the Department of Defense.
Jason has since left active duty but continues his call to serve in the U.S. Army Reserves as a Lieutenant Colonel. He is now a trial lawyer and owner of his own firm, Ballard Law LLC, in Pearisburg, VA. He is an active member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Military Officers Association of America, and the Night Stalkers Association. He resides in Pearisburg, VA with his wife Catherine, and their three children William, James, and John Thomas, who all attend Giles County Public Schools.

Jason was first elected to serve the 12th House District in 2021 by defeating incumbent Democrat, Chris Hurst.  Jason was later re-elected to serve the newly-formed 42nd House District in 2023.
