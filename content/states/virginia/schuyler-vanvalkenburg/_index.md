Schuyler VanValkenburg is a father, teacher, Delegate, and candidate for State Senate. As a History and US Government teacher at Glen Allen High, he teaches his students about the importance of understanding our nation’s history and using that knowledge to strengthen our communities.

In 2017, he wanted to further his career of public service: so he ran for Delegate to serve Virginia and Henrico County. Now, after six years in the House, he’s ready to take his service to the State Senate’s 16th District.

Schuyler’s career in the classroom and his experiences as a father of three gave him a firsthand look at the issues facing everyday families in his district. As the foremost education expert in the House of Delegates, Schuyler has worked tirelessly to ensure that Virginia remains a leader in public education. He also is proud of his work to pass commonsense gun safety legislation, protect a woman’s reproductive freedom, expand access to affordable, high-quality healthcare, and increase access to the ballot box.

In the Senate, he is ready to continue to advocate for meaningful investments to improve our public schools, introduce legislation that will attack the gun violence epidemic in our communities head-on, and work harder than ever to open economic opportunities for all Virginians.
