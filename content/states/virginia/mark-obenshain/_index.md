Background and Education:
- Born in Richmond, Virginia, Obenshain graduated from Virginia Tech with a B.A. in 1984.

Miscarriage Reporting Bill:
- During his 2013 attorney general campaign, Obenshain faced criticism for a bill he introduced in 2009.
- The bill aimed to require women who had miscarriages without medical attendance to report them to authorities within 24 hours.
- Obenshain introduced the bill in response to a case where a Virginia woman disposed of her newborn baby's body in the trash.
- Although the legislation was too broad and unintended, Obenshain clarified that he did not intend to burden women who suffered miscarriages.
