David Reid's journey began in Virginia, where his family moved from Rockbridge County to Richmond's United Methodist Children's Home in 1972. Growing up in a modest four-room house without indoor plumbing, David and his three siblings were placed into cottages at the Children's Home based on their ages and genders. He spent six formative years there before relocating to Tahlequah, Oklahoma, with foster parents.

David's first job was at the Children's Home, where he earned 35 cents an hour maintaining the sprawling 40-acre campus. His duties included mowing grass with tractors and push mowers, collecting trash, trimming bushes, edging sidewalks, and maintaining equipment. These early responsibilities instilled in him the value of hard work, paving the way for his distinction as the first college graduate in his family.

Motivated by a deep-seated desire to give back to the nation that had given him so much, David Reid joined the US Navy Reserve in 1988. Over 23 years of service as a Naval Intelligence Officer, he undertook deployments to South Korea and Iceland, participated in a NATO exercise aboard the USS Mount Whitney, and served alongside the US Army in field operations. His exemplary service earned him the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal three times before his honorable retirement as Commander in 2011.

David's military experience equipped him with invaluable skills in strategic management, banking, global telecommunications, and the defense industry. In 2014, he leveraged this expertise to establish Rockbridge Consulting, a small business specializing in studies and analysis.

Settling in Ashburn since 2000 with his wife Barbara, David has immersed himself in community service. He coached recreational and travel soccer and served as a certified soccer referee, while Barbara and their daughters volunteered at the Loudoun Interfaith Relief food pantry. The family attends Arcola United Methodist Church, and their daughters, Elizabeth and Rebecca, received an exceptional education in Loudoun County Public Schools.

David Reid's life is a testament to resilience, service, and dedication, shaped by his humble beginnings in Virginia to his impactful contributions in military service, business leadership, and community involvement in Loudoun County.
