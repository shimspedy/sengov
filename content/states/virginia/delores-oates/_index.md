Delores Riley Oates was born in Front Royal, Virginia, and proudly attended Warren County High School. She has deep roots in her community, having served as a mentor to teen mothers and volunteered in various church, youth athletic organizations, and civic groups. Delores resides in Warren County with her husband, Rob, and raised her three children there.

As a dedicated public servant, Delores Oates champions several key values and priorities:

Taking on Taxes and Lowering Democrat Inflation: 
Hardworking Virginians have been hit hard by rising prices and bloated government. Delores is committed to cutting taxes for Virginians and ensuring responsible government spending to combat inflation.
Defending Our 2nd Amendment Rights:
Delores recognizes that our 2nd Amendment rights are essential for the survival of our country. She opposes efforts to criminalize law-abiding gun owners and will defend our constitutional rights from liberal gun grabbers.
Safeguarding Our Elections:
Delores believes in restoring trust and integrity to our elections. She advocates for auditing future elections and implementing common-sense voter identification protections to ensure accurate and transparent voting processes.
Securing Our Borders:
National security begins with border security. Delores opposes sanctuary city policies, advocates for ending in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, and seeks to restore the rule of law.
Protecting Life:
Delores is proudly pro-life. In Richmond, she will work to repeal legislation that legalized third-trimester abortions, vote to defund Planned Parenthood, and promote a culture of life in Virginia
