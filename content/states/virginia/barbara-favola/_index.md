Barbara A. Favola is an experienced public servant and a fierce advocate for women, children, families, and our most vulnerable populations. Her journey in public service began as a Presidential Management Intern, and she worked her way up to become a Senior Advisor in the Department of Health and Human Services. During her fifteen years with the Department, she focused on improving the health of minorities and increasing access to healthcare.

Senator Favola's commitment to education was sparked by her son, who was born with learning challenges. She became actively involved in the Arlington Public Schools, helping school officials and parents understand and implement Individual Educational Plans (IEPs) in accordance with the federal IDEA law. Her advocacy for integrated classrooms drew her into the world of public office.

In 1997, Senator Favola won election to the Arlington County Board, where she served for fourteen years, including three terms as chairwoman. During her tenure, she expanded mental health services for youth in public schools, increased access to affordable housing, and championed environmental protections. Her leadership extended to smart growth policies and energy-efficient buildings, and she chaired the Chesapeake Bay Committee on the Council of Governments.

Elected to the Virginia state Senate in 2011, Senator Favola has been a pragmatic champion of progressive values. She led the charge on landmark legislation to end surprise medical billing in Virginia, expanded the hate crimes statute to cover gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability, and advocated for restrictions on the use of restraint and seclusion in public schools. As a breast cancer survivor, she is also a leading advocate for women's health and reproductive rights, serving as chair of the Women's Healthcare Caucus.

In her role as chair of the Senate Rehabilitation and Social Services Committee, Senator Favola has guided legislation supporting foster youth, improving child welfare, and reforming Virginia's prisons to ensure humane and rehabilitation-oriented treatment of the incarcerated. She also serves on the Committees on Finance and Appropriations, and Rules, contributing her expertise to make healthcare more affordable and accessible.

Barbara Favola's dedication to public service and her tireless efforts to create positive change continue to impact the lives of Virginians. Her leadership and advocacy resonate across party lines, making her a respected figure in the state Senate.
