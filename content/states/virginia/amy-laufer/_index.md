Amy Laufer's journey is rooted in her upbringing on a dairy farm in rural Wisconsin, where she learned the value of hard work and resilience as one of eight children. A trailblazer as a first-generation college graduate, she funded her education at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee by working multiple jobs, including a stint packing fish in Alaska. Her academic path led her to earn a bachelor’s degree in geology and to work as a water analyst for the state of Wisconsin.

Amy's dedication to service took her overseas as a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer in Jamaica, where she made lasting impacts by establishing the community’s inaugural lending library and organic learning garden. Inspired by her experiences, Amy pursued a career in education, obtaining a master’s degree in secondary science education from Columbia University’s Teachers College in New York City.

Following her husband Aaron, whom she met during her Peace Corps service, Amy settled in Charlottesville. There, she became deeply involved in the local education landscape, teaching math and science at Louisa County Middle School and Tandem Friends School. Her commitment to education extended to policy advocacy as a member and Chair of the Charlottesville City School Board, where she spearheaded the adoption of the Equality Virginia non-discrimination policy.

Amy's leadership extends beyond the classroom and school board. She founded Virginia’s List in 2014 to empower Democratic women seeking state office, a role that aligns with her involvement in the Virginia Disability Commission and the Albemarle County Democrats. Since assuming office in January 2024 as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates representing the 55th District, Amy has been actively engaged in legislative efforts, serving on committees like Finance, Education, and Agriculture, Chesapeake, and Natural Resources.

Residing in Albemarle County with Aaron and their children—Hannah, Adam, and Henry—Amy Laufer continues to advocate for her community and the broader Commonwealth through her legislative work and support for aspiring leaders in education and beyond.
