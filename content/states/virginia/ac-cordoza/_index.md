A.C. Cordoza was born to a family full of work ethic and a belief in service to our nation.  Growing up, A.C. spent many days working with his father learning the value of hard work and technical precision serving as an apprentice to his fathers construction projects.



Enlisting into the Air Force to serve America was A.C.’s destiny as generations of Cordozas had done.  Following a service of 3 years A.C. honorably left the Air Force and sought to further his education at Thomas Nelson Community College. There he began to gain interest in politics during the 2008 Presidential Campaign as the possibility of the nation electing the first black President. Soon after the election, A.C. began reflecting on the policies of the new Democratic Party finding that his core values did not align with the Democrats, but the Republicans.

​

A servant's heart led A.C. to being asked to run for the Virginia House of Delegates in 2021 where he successfully won a race that he was outspent by big corporate money 16:1. Today, A.C. is known as the voice for the blue collar worker, focusing on real solutions for problems facing Virginia’s working class. Unlike many in office, A,C. Cordoza cannot be bought, he votes for his community and for what is right for the people of the 86th District.



From service to the country to service to the city of Hampton he worked in cyber security for Newport News Shipbuilding where he focused on keeping our Naval assets safe against enemy threats. AC works for the City of Hampton and lives in Hampton where he serves as Vice-Chairman of the Hampton Republican Party.

​

A.C. Cordoza votes for his community and for what is right for the people of Hampton, Poquoson and York County.  In his first two years in office, Delegate Cordoza has earned the reputation as one of Virginias most effective legislators passing 10 bills into law, advancing four resolutions and securing a historic Virginia Attorney Generals opinion that benefits prioritizing educational opportunities.
