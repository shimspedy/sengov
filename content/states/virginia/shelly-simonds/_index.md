Shelly Anne Simonds (born November 9, 1967) is an American educator and politician serving in the Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 70th district. She was first elected in 2019. During the 2013 and 2017 elections, Simonds was the Democratic candidate for Virginia's 94th House of Delegates district in Newport News, Virginia.

Simonds has a strong background in education. Before entering politics, she worked as a teacher and school board member. Her passion for excellence in education has been a driving force throughout her career. Simonds believes that investing in education is essential for the future of our communities and our nation.

In the 2019 election, Simonds ran for a third time against incumbent Delegate Yancey, but this time in a redrawn district. She emerged victorious, winning the November 2019 election with 57.7% of the votes cast, defeating multiple opponents[^1^][1]. Her commitment to public service and dedication to her constituents have made her a respected figure in Virginia politics.

Simonds' journey to the House of Delegates was not without challenges. In the 2017 election, she faced a nail-biting race where she was initially 10 votes behind her opponent. A recount was held, and Simonds was declared the winner by just one vote. However, a previously uncounted ballot led to a tie, and the election was thrown into disarray. Ultimately, after a drawing by lot, the Republican candidate was declared the winner[^1^][1]. Despite this setback, Simonds remained committed to public service and continued to advocate for her community.

As a legislator, Simonds has championed education, healthcare, and environmental issues. She believes in evidence-based policies that benefit all Virginians. Her work in the House of Delegates reflects her dedication to making a positive impact on the lives of her constituents.

Simonds' journey from educator to legislator exemplifies the power of persistence and the importance of civic engagement. Her story serves as an inspiration to those who believe in the transformative potential of public service. Whether in the classroom or the state capitol, Shelly Simonds continues to make a difference for the people of Virginia.
