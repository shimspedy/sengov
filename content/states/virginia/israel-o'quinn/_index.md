Israel Dean O'Quinn, an American politician and a Republican, was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates on November 8, 2011. He currently represents the 44th district, which includes the cities of Bristol and Galax, Grayson County, and parts of Smyth and Washington counties in the southwestern part of the state.

As a strong advocate for Southwest Virginia, Israel works tirelessly to ensure that the Fifth District is well-represented in Richmond. His legislative committee assignments reflect his commitment to serving his constituents: Energy and Commerce, Privileges and Elections, and Rules. Additionally, he has served on the Finance committee as well as the Militia, Police, and Public Safety committee. Israel's leadership extends to his role as the Deputy House Majority Leader.

Before entering politics, Israel held various roles in government and campaigns. He spent two years in the office of Attorney General Jerry Kilgore and actively participated in political campaigns, including those for Governor, Attorney General, US Senate, House of Delegates, and various local offices. His dedication to public service led him to become Past Chairman of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce, which holds Five Star accreditation from the US Chamber of Commerce.

Israel's educational journey began at Patrick Henry High School in Glade Spring, Virginia. Later, he graduated from Emory & Henry College with degrees in Political Science and History. His commitment to education continues as a member of the college's Board of Trustees.

Outside of politics, Israel is employed by K-VA-T Food Stores, the parent company of the Food City retail supermarket chain. He currently directs the company's Office of Strategic Initiatives and chairs the Energy Conservation Committee, which has implemented energy-saving measures throughout the K-VA-T distribution center and numerous stores.

Israel's wife, Emily Gentry O'Quinn, is a corporate communications professional and an avid supporter of community organizations. Her service on various boards focuses on expanding educational opportunities for children and increasing access to the arts.

In his own words, Delegate O'Quinn states, "I am honored to represent the 5th House District and have the opportunity to continue working on behalf of Southwest Virginia. We're geographically a long way from Richmond, but I've focused on making sure we have a strong presence in the General Assembly to overcome those challenges. I promise to keep doing my best to represent our area well" .
