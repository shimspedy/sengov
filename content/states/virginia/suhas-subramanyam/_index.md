Suhas Subramanyam, born on September 26, 1986, in Houston, Texas, is an American lawyer and a prominent political figure. He has made significant contributions to both state and federal politics.

**Early Life and Education:**
Suhas was born to Indian parents from Bengaluru, India, who later immigrated to the United States through Dulles Airport, which interestingly falls within the district he now represents. He attended Clear Lake High School and went on to earn his bachelor's degree in philosophy from Tulane University.

**Career Highlights:**
- **Legislative Aide and Senate Clerk:** After college, Suhas served as a legislative aide for health care and veterans policy in the House of Representatives. He also clerked for the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, where he played a crucial role in reintroducing the DREAM Act.
- **Overturning Wrongful Conviction:** As a second-year law student at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, Suhas helped overturn the wrongful conviction of a man sentenced to life in prison.
- **White House Technology Policy Advisor:** In 2015, Suhas was appointed as a White House technology policy advisor during President Barack Obama's administration. He led a task force focused on technology policy, addressing job creation, IT modernization, and the regulation of emerging technologies.

**Virginia House of Delegates:**
In 2019, Suhas ran for the Virginia House of Delegates, succeeding Democrat John Bell. His platform emphasized improving education, healthcare, and traffic across the region and the entire state of Virginia.

**Virginia Senate and Congressional Candidacy:**
In 2023, Suhas was elected to the Virginia Senate, representing the 32nd district. Shortly thereafter, he announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives in the 2024 election, aiming to succeed Jennifer Wexton in Virginia's 10th congressional district. He won the Democratic primary and will face Republican Mike Clancy in the general election.

Suhas Subramanyam's historic election as the first Indian-American, South Asian, and Hindu to serve in the Virginia General Assembly reflects his commitment to public service and advocacy. His journey from Houston to the halls of power exemplifies the American dream in action.
