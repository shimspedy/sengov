Mark Earley, Jr. is a husband, father, foster-parent, and attorney. Born and raised in Virginia, he's dedicated to making our community a place where families and businesses can flourish.

Originally from Chesapeake, Mark came of age in Midlothian, attending public schools in Chesterfield County. Mark graduated from Virginia Tech, studying History, Political Science, and English. Eager to serve Virginia after college, Mark served in former Governor Bob McDonnell’s administration, primarily assisting with the Prisoner and Juvenile Re-entry Council. While working in the Governor’s Administration, Mark had the opportunity to assist in the improvement of Virginia's efforts to help countless individuals successfully re-enter society and work to better their lives.  
After this opportunity, Mark decided to attend law school so he could continue to help people in need. In 2015, Mark earned his J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law. He earned a prestigious clerkship working for a federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia. After several years practicing law with a large firm, Mark joined his father and brother in a small family run law practice here in Richmond
Mark is a proven leader with a record of fighting for our values. Mark will put his experience to work in Richmond and be a conservative, common sense voice we can count on to deliver results that matter.

Mark and his wife, Mary Alice, have served as foster parents for over two years, having cared for six foster children in that time. His family attends a local church and he's been active in the community, serving on several boards. Mark lives in Midlothian with his wife, two sons, and their hound dog Blue.
