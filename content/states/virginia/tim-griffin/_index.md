Tim grew up in central Virginia where he graduated from Lynchburg Christian Academy and Liberty University.  He returned home after attending Appalachian School of Law, where he served under Virginia Supreme Court Justice Cynthia Kinser and U.S. District Court Judge James Turk.  Tim also served on Law Review, as well as the Moot Court Competitive Teams.

Following law school, Tim served as an Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney where he prosecuted drug dealers, drunk drivers, thieves, sexual offenders, and murderers.  His proudest prosecution was the successful conviction of Lloyd Welch in the murder of Katherine and Sheila Lyon, under the leadership of Wes Nance. 

For the past few years, Tim has served as a Constitutional, and Election law attorney.  He has fought democrats for fair elections in Detroit, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and around the country.  He was also part of a successful effort to end the illegal COVID-19 lockdown orders of Democrat Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf.  Tim reads and writes legislation and is in regular contact with legislators around the nation on cleaning up our state elections.

Tim has served as Chairman of the Bedford County Republican Committee for the past three years.  During his time, the Committee has elected a full seven Republican Board of Supervisors, a Conservative Majority on the School Board, as well as a Republican sweep of all five Constitutional Officers.  With the help of hundreds of others, Tim was part of an effort that led Bedford County to become a top-ten performing Virginia jurisdiction for Governor Glenn Youngkin in the 2021 election. 

Tim lives in Forest, Virginia, and is the father of two beautiful daughters.
