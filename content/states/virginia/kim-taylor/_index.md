Delegate Kim Taylor is a small business owner, mother, and community leader who has proudly served her community as Delegate since 2021. Kim is a small business owner who owns car repair shops with her husband, Butch, where they are proud to employ 30 people. As a mother, Kim understands parents across the Commonwealth have concerns regarding their children's education. As a small business owner, she understands the unique challenges facing small businesses in these uncertain economic times.

​

Under Delegate Kim Taylor’s leadership in Richmond, the General Assembly has sponsored, and passed, legislation that supports victims of human trafficking and expands access to the necessary resources for recovery. She fought for broad tax cuts that allowed Virginians to keep more of their money and cut job-killing regulations that forced many of Virginia’s businesses to close.

Kim is a proven, effective leader who has passed some of the Commonwealth’s most impactful legislation. In just two years, Kim passed legislation that addresses school safety and resources, strengthened punishments for violent criminals and human traffickers by giving a voice to the victims, and sponsored a reduction in retail sales and use taxes for Virginia’s middle-class, helping you keep more of your hard-earned money.
