Rozia “J.R.” Henson Jr. is a resident born and raised in Woodbridge, Virginia. Born to a teenage mother, who raised him alongside his stepfather, Rozia became the second child for the couple. To provide a stable foundation for her children, his mother joined the United States Army. Rozia grew up with two sisters, but over the years, his family grew. He is an adopted brother to two younger Latino siblings, a foster brother to three foster brothers of different nationalities, and an uncle to two nephews and one niece. Rozia’s love for family is important to him, as he continually advocates and takes an active role in the lives of his adopted brothers, foster brothers, nephews, and niece.

A Virginian Story
Rozia is a product of Prince William and Spotsylvania County schools. In first grade, he struggled to learn how to read and was retained in the first grade and placed in the Individualized Education Program (IEP). However, he did not allow that to define him; determined, he graduated early from Massaponax High School. He attended and graduated from Virginia State University, receiving his bachelor’s degree in Political Science, and later attended and graduated from the University of Maryland University College to receive his Master of Business Administration degree. Today, he is a successful federal contractor and Program Manager for the Department of Homeland Security while maintaining his Small Business as a consultant.

Calling to Serve
While studying at Virginia State University, Rozia served as a Legislative Aid in 2014 to Senator Henry L. Marsh, the first elected African American mayor of Richmond, Virginia. Rozia was raised to serve by his parents, and he embodies service in every area of his life. It was not until after he served as a Legislative Aid, serving local and national activist groups, constituents, and leaders in the Commonwealth, he felt that he could do more for the people by serving where laws and legislations are established for the state of Virginia.

Rozia realized it is his duty and calling to be a voice to those who feel as if they are voiceless. To do the work of ensuring that the underrepresented, marginalized voices are heard and that they feel supported by their local leaders and community. Working alongside constituents to let them know that their vote matters.

At Virginia State, Rozia wrote and defended his unpublished graduation thesis on “Minority Voting During Off-Year Elections.” Highlighting some of the disparities people of color faced because of reduced media coverage and limited communications to constituents. His thesis paper was well received by his student colleagues and professors.

After graduating from Virginia State University in 2016, he returned to Woodbridge, VA, and became an involved and active member of the Prince William County Democratic Committee.

Answering the Call
In 2020, former Delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy stepped down to run for Governor, allowing Rozia the opportunity to run in the special election for the Virginia General Assembly. Rozia put forth his best effort to represent the former House of Delegates 2nd District seat, which represents parts of Prince William County (Woodbridge) and Stafford County.

Unfortunately, he was unsuccessful in the five-day special primary, but his heart for service did not waiver. Rozia won the hearts of the Woodbridge community, local and federal leaders, and the local Democratic Party, and he became even more active and dedicated towards serving the community.

Stepping Forward
Rozia became a community leader, activist, and grassroots organizer. He won the election as the Chair of the Woodbridge Democratic Committee of the Prince William County Democratic Party. In 2021, Rozia was elected as Senior Vice Chair of the Prince William County Democratic Committee and Vice President of the Prince William Young Democrats. Rozia currently serves as Commissioner of the Historical Commission appointed by the Woodbridge District Supervisor Margaret Franklin. Rozia serves as the liaison for Voter Protection representing Prince William County for the Democratic Party of Virginia. If elected, Rozia will take the fight to Richmond protecting our democracy and will represent the new 19th House of Delegates District.
