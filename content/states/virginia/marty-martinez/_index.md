Fernando “Marty” Martinez is an American Democratic politician from Virginia. He was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in the 2023 Virginia House of Delegates election from the 29th district. Marty grew up in Southern California in a small house with four brothers and five sisters. At a young age, he was inspired by the resilience and sacrifice of his mother, who worked tirelessly to provide for their family and make ends meet.

Upon graduating high school, Marty enlisted in the United States Air Force and served for over seven years before being honorably discharged as a Staff Sergeant in 1978. Through the GI Bill, Marty earned his B.S. degrees in Economics and Computer Science from Portland State University, Oregon.

In 1993, Marty moved to the Town of Leesburg with his wife Doris and children. He began working as a government contractor supporting the Federal Aviation Administration. Marty became deeply involved with the Loudoun community, serving as a baseball coach, PTO president, Boy Scout leader, and community advocate.

In 2002, Marty Martinez ran for and successfully won a seat on Leesburg Town Council. He has been re-elected for four additional four-year terms. Marty was elected Vice Mayor in January 2019 and previously served as Vice Mayor from July 2004 to June 2006. On Town Council, he has worked to grow Leesburg while preserving its historic character. Time and again, he’s fought for our Virginia values by building consensus and engaging in people-centric policy.

Marty lives in Leesburg with his wife, Doris. He has five children, nine grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
