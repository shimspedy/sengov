Jas Jeet Singh, commonly known as JJ Singh, is a Democratic politician serving in the Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 26th district. He assumed office on January 13, 2025, following a special election, and his current term is set to end in January 2027.

Born and raised in Northern Virginia, Singh's journey into politics is deeply rooted in his commitment to public service and his belief in the American Dream. His parents immigrated to the United States from India in the 1970s, and their hard work and dedication inspired Singh to pursue a career that would allow him to give back to his community. He graduated from the University of Virginia with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and later earned dual master's degrees in Public Administration and Business Administration from Harvard University.

Before entering the Virginia House of Delegates, Singh built an impressive career in public service and business. He served in the Peace Corps, where he worked in Bolivia to support small businesses, becoming the first turban-wearing Sikh to join the organization. His dedication to economic development continued as he worked as a credit analyst in the White House Office of Management and Budget and as an economic policy advisor for U.S. Senator Chris Coons. Singh's contributions to public service earned him recognition, including being named one of the 50 most beautiful people on Capitol Hill by The Hill in 2014.

In addition to his political career, Singh is the President of Retreat Hotels and Resorts and actively participates in local and national organizations. He serves on the Loudoun County Economic Development Advisory Commission, is the treasurer of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, and is an elected member of the board of the National Peace Corps Association.

Singh's election to the Virginia House of Delegates marked a historic moment, as he became the first Sikh member in its 249-year history. His victory in the special election was a testament to his dedication to representing the diverse voices of his district and his commitment to addressing the challenges faced by his constituents. Singh's leadership and vision continue to shape his work in the House of Delegates, where he focuses on issues such as economic development, education, and community empowerment.
