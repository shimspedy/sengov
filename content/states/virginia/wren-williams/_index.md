Wren M. Williams, an American businessman, attorney, and politician, has dedicated his career to public service. Born on January 12, 1989, in Stuart, Virginia, he currently serves as the delegate for the 47th district of the Virginia House of Delegates. However, his journey in politics began long before this recent role.

Early Life and Education

Wren attended Hampdenâ€“Sydney College, where he honed his leadership skills and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2011. His passion for law led him to pursue further education at Samford University's Cumberland School of Law, where he obtained both an M.B.A. and a J.D. in 2014.

Legal Career

After completing his studies, Wren co-founded the Schneider & Williams law firm. His legal expertise and commitment to justice have been evident throughout his career. As a law clerk, he gained valuable experience and developed a deep understanding of the legal system.

Political Ascent

Wren's political journey took a significant turn in 2021. Representing the 9th district until the 2021 redistricting, he defeated the seven-term incumbent, Charles Poindexter, in the Republican primary. In the 2021 Virginia House of Delegates election, he secured victory against Democratic nominee Bridgette Craighead.

Legislative Impact

As a delegate, Wren Williams has actively contributed to shaping Virginia's policies. In 2022, he proposed House Bill 781, emphasizing the importance of teaching certain aspects of American history in public schools. His efforts aimed to counter the spread of Critical Race Theory in educational institutions.

Controversy and Resilience

Wren's journey has not been without challenges. In 2022, fellow Republican state delegate Marie March accused him of assault after a party fundraising event. Despite formal charges, Wren was found not guilty in court. He attributed the accusations to redistricting, which merged both delegates into the same House district for the 2023 election.

Wren Williams continues to serve his constituents with dedication and resilience. His commitment to education, justice, and public welfare remains unwavering. As the representative for the 47th district, he strives to make a positive impact on Virginia's legislative landscape.
