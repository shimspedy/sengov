John Joseph McGuire III (born August 24, 1968) is an American politician and businessman who currently serves as a member of the Virginia State Senate. His political journey began when he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, representing the old 56th district, which included areas to the North and West of Richmond, Virginia.

Before entering politics, McGuire had an impressive background as a former United States Navy SEAL. Despite overcoming severe injuries from a trampoline accident, he founded a physical training business called SEAL Team Physical Training, which has been employed by Virginia Commonwealth University sports teams.

In 2017, McGuire ran for the Virginia House of Delegates in the 56th district, succeeding retiring Republican incumbent Peter Farrell. His main motivations were to support veterans, law enforcement officers, and promote business growth in Virginia. Despite facing challenges related to his residency, McGuire emerged victorious in the general election, defeating health care consultant Melissa Dart.

During his time in the House of Delegates, McGuire championed legislation to put veterans' ID on Virginia drivers' licenses, demonstrating his commitment to supporting those who have served our country.

In 2023, McGuire was elected to the newly redrawn 10th Senate district. He is currently a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in Virginia's 5th congressional district, facing incumbent Bob Good in the Republican primary. The final vote tally saw McGuire beating Good by a 0.6% margin, with the election results set to be certified on July 2. The primary winner will then compete against Democrat Gloria Witt in the general election.

Fearless, unapologetic, and a Christian conservative, John McGuire continues to make his mark in Virginia politics.
