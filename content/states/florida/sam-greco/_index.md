Samuel Anthony Greco, born on August 14, 1992, is an American politician, attorney, and naval officer who currently serves as a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 19th district. This district comprises all of Flagler County and the southeastern portion of St. Johns County, including the cities of St. Augustine and Palm Coast.

Greco's journey began in New Haven, Connecticut, where he attended Hopkins School and served as student council president before graduating in 2011. He then pursued higher education at Georgetown University, earning a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service in 2015. His academic journey continued at Georgetown University Law Center, where he received his Juris Doctor in 2019.

In 2018, Greco joined the United States Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) and served on active duty from 2019 to 2024. During his time in the Navy, he achieved the rank of Lieutenant and was part of the United States Navy Reserve. His military service provided him with valuable experience and a strong foundation in leadership and legal expertise.

Greco's political career took off when he decided to run for the Florida House of Representatives. After winning the August primary in a landslide, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in November 2024. His campaign received endorsements from prominent figures such as Governor Ron DeSantis, Senator Marco Rubio, Congressman Michael Waltz, and Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Paul Renner. Greco was officially sworn into office on November 19, 2024.

As a member of the Florida House of Representatives, Greco has focused on various issues, including criminal justice reform, veterans' affairs, and economic development. His background as a military officer and attorney has equipped him with the skills and knowledge to address these important matters effectively.

In his personal life, Greco is a devout Catholic and married his wife, Elanda, in 2023. The couple resides in St. Augustine, Florida, where they are actively involved in their community. Greco's dedication to public service, both in the military and in politics, reflects his commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of his constituents and the broader community.
