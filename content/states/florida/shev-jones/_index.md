Shevrin D. "Shev" Jones was born on October 12, 1983, in Miami Gardens, Florida. He is an American politician and a member of Democratic Party who was elected to the Florida State Senate in 2020 to represent the 34th District. Before this, he was a Democratic member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 101st District, which included southeastern Broward County since 2012. Jones is the first gay person and first LGBT Black person elected to the Florida Senate.

Jones attended Florida A&M University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry and molecular biology in 2006. After receiving this degree, he returned to South Florida, where he taught Advanced Placement Chemistry in Broward County Public Schools, and then worked as a Biology instructor at Florida Atlantic University High School. In 2017 Jones obtained a Master of Education from Florida Atlantic University. In 2022, he earned a PhD in Educational Leadership from the same institution.

In 2010, he ran for a seat on the Broward County Commission in District 8, running against Barbara Sharief and Angelo Castillo. Jones came in third place, receiving 17% of the vote to Sharief's 62% and Castillo's 21%.

In early October 2016, Jones abruptly lost the ability to walk after he ruptured part of his lower spinal cord during an accident at the gym, causing a nerve injury that his doctors told him should have left him paralyzed. Despite this, he continued to serve his community and make a difference in the political landscape of Florida.
