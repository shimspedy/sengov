In 2024, Leek ran for election to the Florida State Senate and won the general election on November 5, 2024. He assumed office on the same day, succeeding Travis Hutson.

His career in law spans over two decades, during which he served as the managing partner at the law firm of Cobb Cole in Daytona Beach. In 2018, he joined Foundation Risk Partners, Corp., a national insurance brokerage, as the Chief Legal Officer and Executive Vice President.

Leek resides in Ormond Beach, Florida, with his wife Michelle and their two daughters.
