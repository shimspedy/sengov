Mackenson "Mack" Bernard, born on March 4, 1976, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, is a distinguished Haitian-American politician and lawyer. He moved to Florida in 1986 and has since become a prominent figure in the state's political landscape. Bernard's educational journey began at Atlantic High School, followed by earning a Bachelor of Science in Political Science and Criminal Justice from Florida State University in 1997. He furthered his education at the University of Florida Levin College of Law, where he obtained his Juris Doctor in 2002 and a Master of Laws in Taxation in 2003.

Bernard's political career took off in 2008 when he served as a Delray Beach city commissioner and deputy vice mayor. In 2009, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 27th district. During his tenure, he was the president of the Palm Beach County Caucus of Black Elected Officials. Although he faced a narrow defeat in the 2012 primary election for the Florida Senate, Bernard remained a resilient and influential figure in Florida politics.

In 2016, Bernard was elected to the Palm Beach County Commission, where he served until 2024. During his time on the commission, he held various leadership positions, including county mayor and county vice mayor. Bernard's dedication to public service and his community earned him numerous accolades, such as the Housing Hero of the Year award by the Housing Leadership Council of Palm Beach County in 2024.

In June 2024, Bernard was elected to the Florida Senate, representing the 24th district. His election was part of a strategic "seat swap" with Bobby Powell, who succeeded Bernard on the Palm Beach County Commission. As a state senator, Bernard has been actively involved in several committees, including Ethics and Elections, Agriculture, Appropriations Committee on Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development, Criminal Justice, Finance and Tax, Fiscal Policy, and Regulated Industries.

Throughout his career, Bernard has been affiliated with and held leadership positions in various organizations, such as the board of Leadership Florida, Palm Beach County Homeless Advisory Board, Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County, Toussaint Lâ€™Ouverture High School for Arts and Social Justice, Color of Hope Foundation, 211 Palm Beach Treasure Coast, CJ Foundation, Inc., Delray Beach Chamber of Commerce, and the Marie Louise Community Foundation, Inc.

Bernard's professional background as an attorney specializing in real estate and tax law has further solidified his reputation as a knowledgeable and dedicated public servant. His commitment to his constituents and his unwavering dedication to improving the lives of Floridians have made him a respected and influential figure in the state's political arena. Bernard resides in Boynton Beach, Florida, with his wife, Shawn, and their three children.
