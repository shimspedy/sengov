Fiona Fuller McFarland, born in 1985, is an American U.S. Navy reservist and a state legislator in Florida. She currently serves in the Florida House of Representatives representing the 73rd district, which covers parts of Sarasota. She is a member of the Republican Party.

McFarland is the daughter of former White House National Security Advisor KT McFarland. Originally elected to the House of Representatives in November 2020, and reelected again in 2022, McFarland has served on a number of committees. Currently, she is the chair of the Transportation & Modals Subcommittee and is a representative of the Infrastructure Strategies Committee, Civil Justice Subcommittee, Energy, Communications & Cybersecurity Subcommittee, and the Regulatory Reform & Economic Development Subcommittee.

McFarland is married to fellow Naval Academy classmate and native Floridian Matthew Melton. They have three children.

McFarland is a 2008 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, where she majored in Political Science and was captain of the varsity women’s rowing team. She served for eight years in the navy on active duty as a Surface Warfare officer, completing tours of duty onboard the Arleigh Burke Class Guided Missile Destroyer USS Preble (DDG 88), as an inaugural crewmember on the Littoral Combat Ship USS Coronado (LCS 4) and in the Navy Office of Information in the Pentagon. While on active duty, she earned an MBA from the University of Chapel Hill’s Kenan Flagler Business School in 2013.

In 2016, McFarland joined the US Navy Reserves, where she participated in multinational antisubmarine warfare exercises above the Arctic Circle with the US European Command, as well as with the US Africa Command.

In her civilian capacity, McFarland worked as a consultant with the global business management consulting firm McKinsey and Company, where she served clients across media, consumer goods, manufacturing, and advanced technology industries, among others, consulting directly with senior executives of Fortune 500 to solve business and operations challenges.

In June 2019, McFarland announced that she would be running to unseat the incumbent Democratic representative Margaret Good in the 72nd district of the Florida House of Representative.
