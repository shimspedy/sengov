Cynthia "Cyndi" Ward Stevenson is a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 17th District, which includes all of northern and central St. Johns County and extends south to St. Augustine and St. Augustine Beach.

Early Life and Education:
Stevenson, whose maiden name is Ward, was born in Daytona Beach, Florida, where she was active in 4-H. She graduated from Stetson University with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a major in Accounting in 1981. She is a Certified Public Accountant.

Political Career:
Stevenson assumed office on April 8, 2015. She was first elected to the chamber in a special election on April 7, 2015. She won re-election to the Florida House of Representatives to represent District 18 outright in the general election on November 8, 2022, after the Republican primary and general election were canceled.

St. Johns County Commission:
In 2004, Stevenson ran for the St. Johns County Commission from District 1. She raised more money than any of the other candidates, built up her knowledge of the issues by regularly attending County Commission meetings, and campaigned on maintaining public education and the county's high quality of life. Stevenson emerged narrowly victorious, receiving 36% of the vote.

In 2008, when she ran for re-election, she was challenged by Albert Abbatiello, who served as a Supervisor on the Julington Creek Plantation Community Development District, in the Republican primary. Abbatiello attacked Stevenson for approving too many residential developments, but Stevenson argued that her decision to approve developments is not based on a "batting average." Ultimately, Abbatiello did not present a serious challenge to Stevenson, and she won renomination with 67% of the vote.

In the general election, she faced Merrill Paul Roland, an independent candidate, and won re-election easily with 79% of the vote. When she ran for re-election to a third term in 2012, she faced a stiff challenge in the Republican primary from Brian Iannucci, a businessman and a member of the St. Augustine Tea Party. Iannucci attacked Stevenson for approving a property tax increase, and argued that the county could have dipped into its reserve fund instead. Stevenson responded that property taxes have decreased in the county consistently since 2007, and that the county was statutorily-prohibited from using the reserve funds unless there was an emergency. Owing to the competitive nature of the race, Stevenson only narrowly won renomination, winning 54% of the vote to Iannucci's 46%. In the general election, she faced independent candidate Merrill Paul Roland once again, and, just like four years prior, defeated him in a landslide with 77% of the vote.
