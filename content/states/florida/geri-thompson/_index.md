Geraldine Fortenberry Thompson, known as Geri Thompson, was born on November 18, 1948, in New Orleans, Louisiana. She is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. She currently serves as a member of the Florida State Senate from the 15th district.

Thompson moved to the state of Florida in 1955, where she grew up in the town of Perrine. Members of her family worked in agriculture and construction. She attended Miami-Dade Community College and received a scholarship to attend the University of Miami in Coral Gables, where she enrolled shortly after that school ended racial segregation. In 1970, she received a bachelor's degree with honors in journalism and business education.

She moved with her husband, Emerson, to Tallahassee, where he attended law school and she worked in state government and higher education. Her first position in Tallahassee was as Executive Secretary to Representative Gwendolyn Sawyer Cherry, the first African American woman to serve in the Florida House of Representatives. After working for several years, she sought a Master of Science degree in Communication from Florida State University, which she received in 1973. She then joined her husband in Orlando.

Thompson began work as a teacher in Orange County Public Schools. After six years, she left the classroom to accept a position as Director of the Equal Opportunity Office at Valencia Community College where she served for 24 years as Assistant to the President.

Thompson served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 44th District from 2018 to 2022. The district included Windermere, Winter Garden, Gotha, Lake Buena Vista, Oakland, parts of Ocoee, and the Dr. Phillips, Horizon West, and Williamsburg communities in Southwest Orange County, FL. The district contains Walt Disney World, Universal Studios Florida, SeaWorld, International Drive, and the Orange County Convention Center.

A veteran member of the Florida Legislature, she previously served as a member of the Florida State Senate from 2012 to 2016, representing parts of Orlando and western Orange County. She also served three terms in the Florida House of Representatives, from 2006 to 2012.
