Jay Norbert Trumbull was born on February 21, 1989, in Panama City, Florida. He is a Republican politician who served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 6th District, which includes Panama City in southern Bay County, until 2022. He currently serves as a Senator for the 2nd district of Florida.

Trumbull attended Bay High School and Auburn University, where he graduated with his bachelor's degree in small business management and entrepreneurship. After graduation, he worked for his family's bottled water and water conditioning business as part of the management team.

In 2014, Trumbull ran to succeed incumbent State Representative Jimmy Patronis, who was unable to seek re-election due to term limits. He faced former Bay County School Board Member Thelma Rohan, Melissa Hagan, and Tho Bishop in the Republican primary, where he campaigned on his support for making Florida "the most business-friendly place in the country," which he said was achievable with lower taxes, less government regulation, and lawsuit reform. Trumbull won the primary with 43% of the vote to Rohan's 24%, Hagan's 23%, and Bishop's 10%, and advanced to the general election, where he faced Jamie Shepard, the Democratic nominee, and Henry Newman Lawrence, the Green Party nominee. He campaigned as a supporter of lower taxes and reduced regulation, and voiced his opposition to the Common Core State Standards Initiative. Trumbull won the general election with 69% of the vote to Shepard's 28% and Newman's 3%.

In 2022, Trumbull ran for election to the Florida State Senate to represent District 2. He won in the general election on November 8, 2022, defeating Carolynn Zonia with 78.5% of the votes.

Throughout his political career, Trumbull has been assigned to various committees including Commerce and Tourism - Chair; Appropriations Committee on Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development, Vice Chair; Appropriations Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government; Banking and Insurance; Fiscal Policy; Judiciary; Transportation; Select Committee on Resiliency.

Jay Trumbull is dedicated to advancing the freedoms, liberties, and rights of all Floridians. His work ethic is unparalleled and his ability to create bipartisan solutions is well known in Tallahassee.
