Keith Perry, born on December 3, 1958, is a Republican member of the Florida Senate. He represents the 9th district, which encompasses Alachua, Putnam, and part of Marion County in North Central Florida. His political journey began in 2010 when he served in the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 22nd district until 2012, and then the 21st district from 2012 to 2016.

Born and raised in Tallahassee, Perry attended Buchholz High School in Gainesville. After graduating, he started Keith Perry Roofing Contractors, which grew into a successful roofing company in Florida. Perry's entrepreneurial spirit didn't stop there. He also founded the House of Hope, a Christian-affiliated rehabilitation center for recently released prisoners.

In 2010, Perry decided to enter the political arena. He ran for the 22nd District seat in the Florida House of Representatives, which was vacated by Larry Cretul due to term limits. Perry won the Republican primary and went on to win the general election with 61% of the vote.

When Florida House districts were redrawn in 2012, Perry ran for re-election in the 21st District. Despite the district being vastly different from the 22nd District, Perry was re-elected with 57% of the vote.

During his tenure in the legislature, Perry sponsored legislation that extended foster care from age 18 to 21. This ensured that foster children who turned 18 but had not obtained their high school diploma were not left entirely on their own.

In 2016, Perry ran for the newly drawn open Senate seat anchored by Alachua County after court-ordered redistricting. He won the general election against former state senator Rod Smith with 52.6% of the vote. Perry's goals for his term included reducing taxes, reducing government regulation, and increasing funding for the arts and music in elementary schools.

Perry's dedication to public service and his commitment to the people of Florida are evident in his work. He continues to serve in the Florida State Senate, representing District 9.
