Travis Hutson, born on October 3, 1984, in Jacksonville, Florida, is a Republican member of the Florida Senate. He represents the 7th district, which includes Flagler, St. Johns, and northern Volusia County, since 2016. Before this, he represented the 6th district from 2015 to 2016.

Hutson attended Pedro Menendez High School in southern St. Johns County, and then graduated from Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, where he met his wife and received a degree in economics. After graduating, he began work as a real estate agent, overseeing the agricultural portfolio for his family's private real estate investment business, the Hutson Companies.

In 2012, following the reconfiguration of the Florida House of Representatives districts, Hutson opted to run in the newly created 24th District. He won the Republican primary unopposed, and faced St. Johns County Commissioner Milissa Holland, the Democratic nominee, and Michael Cornish, an independent candidate, in the general election. The Florida Democratic Party supported Holland in the election, and sent out a mailer attacking Hutson for supporting the privatization of Medicare. Hutson responded by noting that it was unfortunate that Democrats were stretching his support for Governor Romney to mean he shared all of his positions on issues, and further, it was outrageous that they were attempting to scare seniors over an issue that the state legislature doesn't control. In the end, Hutson ended up narrowly defeating Holland, winning 49% of the vote to her 47% and Cornish's 3%. Hutson was re-elected in 2014 to his second term in the House without opposition.

When State Senator John E. Thrasher announced that he would resign from the legislature to serve as the President of Florida State University, a special election was held to replace him. Hutson announced that he would run, as did fellow State Representative Ronald Renuart, and both submitted their resignations from the Florida House. They were joined in the primary by Dennis McDonald, a former candidate for the Flagler County Commission. Hutson started out with a significant financial advantage over Renuart after he transferred $300,000 from his House re-election campaign to his Senate campaign, and portrayed himself as the "true Conservative" in the race, noting his experience in the legislature of passing legislation on the economy and public safety.
