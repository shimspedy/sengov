Erika Booth is an American educator and politician who currently serves as a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives from the 35th district, which includes most of Osceola County and eastern parts of Orange County. She was born on September 27, 1977, in Kissimmee, Florida. Erika graduated from Saint Cloud High School in 1995 and earned her bachelor's degree in health science from the University of Florida in 2000. She later earned a master's degree in education from the University of Central Florida.

Booth has been a public elementary school teacher for 20 years and was honored for her teaching techniques in 2020. She was elected to the Osceola County School Board for District 5 in 2022. She resigned from her office after her final board meeting on December 12, 2023, and was succeeded by fellow Republican Scott Ramsey, who was appointed to the seat by Governor Ron DeSantis on July 20, 2024.

After an unsuccessful campaign for the 35th district of the Florida House of Representatives in the 2024 special election, which she lost to Tom Keen, Booth announced her candidacy for a rematch in the 2024 Florida House of Representatives election. Her campaign was endorsed by DeSantis, and she won the August primary with 63% of the vote. Booth went on to defeat Keen in the general election, a gain for Republicans. She was sworn into office on November 19, 2024.

Booth married her husband Ricky, a current Osceola County commissioner, in 2005. They have three children and live in St. Cloud, Florida. Booth's dedication to education and her community has been a driving force in her political career, and she continues to work towards improving the lives of her constituents in the 35th district.
