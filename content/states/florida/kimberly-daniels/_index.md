Kimberly Daniels was born on June 12, 1961. She is an American minister, religious author, politician, wife, and mother of four from Jacksonville, Florida. She is a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing House District 14 (part of Duval County). She began her political career as an at-large member of the Jacksonville City Council.

Daniels is a graduate of Florida State University where she obtained a bachelor's degree in criminology. She also has a master's degree in Christian education and a doctorate in Christian counseling from the not regionally accredited Jacksonville Theological Seminary. Daniels' book Breaking the Power of Familiar Spirits is now a class textbook at JTS.

Daniels has expressed thankfulness to God for slavery and for her time in a crackhouse (she is a self-described former sex worker and drug addict), which she saw as ultimately leading to her religious conversion. In 2011 Daniels was elected to the Jacksonville City Council as an at-large member. On March 9, 2015, then-city councilwoman Daniels was involved in a profanity-laced squabble with council candidate Sirretta Williams, also a local minister. She lost her bid for re-election in 2015, 55% to 45%. Her Republican opponent received support from LGBT groups and white liberals due to Daniels' controversial views and financial problems.

She served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing House District 14 (part of Duval County) as a member of the Democratic Party from 2016–2020 before losing her re-election campaign to Florida state House representative Angie Nixon. During the 2022 election, Nixon ran to represent House District 13, creating a vacant seat in House District 14. On the last day of qualifying for the 2022 election, Daniels entered the race for the House District 14 seat in 2022. On August 23, 2022, she easily took the Democratic Primary for House District 14, winning all of the district’s 41 precincts. Shortly thereafter, the write-in candidate withdrew from the race, securing Daniels’ return to the Florida House of Representatives, this time without ever having to win a general election campaign.
