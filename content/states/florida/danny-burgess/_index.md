Danny Burgess, born on June 1, 1986, is an American politician who currently serves as a Florida State Senator from District 23, which includes parts of Hillsborough and Pasco counties. He is a member of the Republican party.

Burgess was born in Zephyrhills, Florida. While a college student, he was elected to the Zephyrhills City Council in 2005. Burgess was re-elected in 2007, and he served as President of the City Council. In 2008, after he graduated with a degree in political science, he resigned from the City Council to attend the Dwayne O. Andreas School of Law in Orlando, graduating with his Juris Doctor in 2011.

Upon graduation, he was commissioned in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the U.S. Army Reserve as a first lieutenant and continues to serve in the rank of captain. He also began practicing with Johnson, Auvil, Pratico & Chane PA.

After the Mayor of Zephyrhills resigned after he faced impeachment proceedings over allegations of sexual harassment, Burgess ran in a special election to succeed him, and won, serving out the final year of the previous mayor's term.

In 2014, incumbent State Representative Will Weatherford was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, so Burgess ran to succeed him. He won the Republican primary unopposed, and advanced to the general election, where he faced retired social studies teacher Beverly Ledbetter.

Burgess assumed office as a member of the Florida Senate from the 23rd district on November 8, 2022. He previously served as the executive director of the Florida Department of Veterans' Affairs, as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, and as the mayor of Zephyrhills.

Burgess is married to Courtney Anne Burgess and they have three children: Adeline Belle Burgess, Daniel Wright Burgess III, and Eleanor Rose Burgess.
