Fentrice DeNell Driskell, born on March 3, 1979, is an American attorney and politician who is the Representative in the Florida House of Representatives from the 67th House district in Hillsborough County. She is Of Counsel at the law firm of Carlton Fields. A Democrat, she is minority leader in the Florida House of Representatives.

Driskell was born in Winter Haven, Florida to African-American parents. She earned her Bachelor of Arts from Harvard University and her Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center. After law school, Driskell was a clerk for Judge Anne C. Conway of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Fentrice also was an intern for Judge Andrew J. Peck of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Driskell was elected in the general election on November 6, 2018, winning 53 percent of the vote over 47 percent for incumbent Republican candidate Shawn Harrison. Driskell served as the Florida House Democratic Policy Chair for the 2020–2022 term. Driskell was unanimously elected as Leader of the Florida House Democratic Caucus for the 2024–2026 term. She will be the first black woman to serve in this role.

In April 2022, Driskell argued that the bill to repeal the Reedy Creek Improvement Act would impose tax burdens on Orange and Osceola counties in the "billions of dollars". On April 21, 2022, Driskell attempted to stage a sit-in demonstration to prevent a vote on proposed changes to the Florida congressional district maps that included dismantling of her district. The attempted demonstration was unsuccessful in preventing the proposed redistricting.
