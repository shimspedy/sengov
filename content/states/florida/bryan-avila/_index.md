Bryan Avila, born on June 25, 1984, is an American Republican politician who currently serves as a member of the Florida Senate, representing the 39th District. He assumed office on November 8, 2022.

Before his tenure in the Florida Senate, Avila served in the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 111th District, which includes parts of Miami and Hialeah in northeastern Miami-Dade County, from November 4, 2014, to November 8, 2022. He succeeded Eduardo González and was succeeded by David Borrero due to redistricting.

Avila was born and raised in Hialeah, Florida. He graduated from Miami Springs High School in 2002. He attended Miami Dade College, receiving his associates degree in 2004, and graduated from the University of Miami with a bachelor's degree in political science in 2006. Avila went on to attend Florida International University, where he graduated with a Master's degree in Criminal Justice as well as a Master of Public Administration degree in 2010.

In 2011, Avila was appointed to serve on the Planning and Zoning Board for the City of Hialeah. The following year, he was appointed to the city's Scholarship Board. In 2013, Avila was elected as the vice-chairman of the Republican Party of Miami-Dade County and served until his election to the Florida House of Representatives.

Avila is married to his high school sweetheart, Cindy Gil-Avila. In 2015, their daughter, Olivia, was born.

In 2014, Avila ran to succeed incumbent State Representative Eduardo González, who was unable to seek re-election due to Florida term limits. He faced Alexander Anthony, a former candidate for Mayor in Miami Springs in the Republican primary. Avila campaigned on improving the state's economy, cutting taxes, expanding educational opportunities, reducing the size of government, and eliminating corporate welfare. He earned the endorsement of the Miami Herald, which, though it recommended his candidacy, criticized his opposition to Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Avila ended up defeating Anthony by a wide margin. He won the Republican primary with 60% of the vote and advanced to the general election, where he faced Mariano Corcilli, the Democratic nominee.
