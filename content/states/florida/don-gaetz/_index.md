Donald Jay Gaetz, born on January 22, 1948, in Rugby, North Dakota, is an American businessman and Republican politician. He has been a member of the Florida State Senate since 2024, representing parts of Northwest Florida. Gaetz previously served in the Florida State Senate from 2006 to 2016 and was Senate President from 2012 to 2014.

Gaetz's early life was marked by the influence of his father, Jerry Gaetz, who was a mayor and state legislator. Tragically, Jerry Gaetz passed away from a heart attack during the 1964 North Dakota Republican Party state convention. Don Gaetz attended Concordia College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in religion and political science. He later received a Master of Public Administration in education from Troy State University.

In 1978, Gaetz moved to Florida and began his career as a hospital administrator in Jacksonville. He lobbied the legislature to create hospice care programs for the dying, which led to the founding of VITAS Healthcare Corporation in 1983. Gaetz and a group of investors established the company, which he later sold for nearly half a billion dollars in 2004.

Gaetz's political career began in 1994 when he ran for the Okaloosa County School Board. He won the election with 69% of the vote and served on the board until 2000. During his tenure, Gaetz campaigned for a one-cent sales tax to fund school construction and renovation, which was approved by voters in a 1995 special election. He also called for an investigation into the conduct of a vice-principal at Niceville High School, where his son attended, after reports surfaced of the vice-principal promoting his religious beliefs.

In 2000, Gaetz was elected Superintendent of the Okaloosa County School District, a position he held until 2006. He then ran for the Florida State Senate, representing the 4th district from 2006 to 2012 and the 1st district from 2012 to 2016. As Senate President, Gaetz focused on education reform, healthcare, and economic development.

After a brief hiatus from politics, Gaetz returned to the Florida State Senate in 2024, representing the 1st district once again. He continues to be an influential figure in Florida politics, advocating for policies that promote economic growth, education, and healthcare improvements. Gaetz is married to Victoria Quertermous and has two children, including former Congressman Matt Gaetz.
