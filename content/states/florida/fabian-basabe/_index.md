Fabián Basabe, born on March 30, 1978, in New York City, is an American businessman and former reality television star. He has been serving as a member of the Florida House of Representatives for the 106th district since November 8, 2022.

Basabe was born to an American mother and an Ecuadorian father. In 1987, his family moved to Miami, where his parents operated a hotel. He graduated from Cheshire Academy and later studied international relations at Pepperdine University. After his studies, he moved to Manhattan, where he became a socialite and television personality.

Before entering politics, Basabe appeared in the reality television series Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive. In 2021, he filed to run for Miami Beach City Commissioner but was removed from the ballot when it was found he did not meet the Miami Beach one-year residency requirement. Basabe describes himself as fiscally conservative and socially liberal.

In 2016, Basabe was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct in Miami Beach after he climbed on the roof of a car and shouted at pedestrians as the vehicle traveled down Washington Avenue. The Miami New Times reported Basabe's encounter with U.S. Marshals in August 2020, when "armed agents surrounded him on his boat in a marina near Charleston, South Carolina." According to the report, "agents were acting on an outstanding warrant after Basabe allegedly failed to address a criminal charge arising from a Miami Beach incident in which he grabbed a neighbor's phone." Basabe was extradited from South Carolina to Florida.

State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle asked Governor DeSantis to reassign Basabe's case to a different jurisdiction after Basabe repeatedly tried to influence the prosecutor. On April 13, 2023, CBS 4 Miami reported an allegation that Basabe physically assaulted his 25-year-old legislative aide. In a statement to CBS 4, the aide claimed Basabe had been drinking after Governor Ron DeSantis's inauguration on January 3, before slapping him in the face and demanding he stand in a corner. The law firm hired by the Florida House leadership to conduct an investigation into the slapping concluded that the incident was "inconclusive."

In July 2023, two male aides filed complaints alleging Basabe sexually harassed them, saying he told them he wanted to have sex and wanted to be a "bottom" while they could be "tops". A legislative aide said Basabe slapped him on the buttocks during a visit to a local elementary school and said, "I want all of that butt." A volunteer in Basabe's office claimed that Basabe instructed him to openly flirt with him when they were at the state capitol.
