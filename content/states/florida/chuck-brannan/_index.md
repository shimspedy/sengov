Robert Charles "Chuck" Brannan III, known as Chuck Brannan, is a Republican member of the Florida Legislature representing the state's 10th House district. This district includes Baker, Columbia, Hamilton, and Suwannee counties and part of Alachua County.

Born on February 1, 1962, Brannan is a seventh-generation Floridian. He was raised in Macclenny and grew up working on the family's poultry, hay, corn, and cattle farm. He also worked in his parents' rural grocery store where they also sold gas, feed, seed, and fertilizer. As a youth, Chuck raised show and commercial cattle and still does to this day. He also worked an additional job in road construction to put himself through college.

Brannan received his Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice from the University of Florida. During his time at UF, he was an Alpha Gamma Rho Ag fraternity brother, Southeast U.S. president and member of the Block and Bridle club, on the UF Livestock Judging Team, and a Justice on the Student Traffic Court in student government. Upon graduation, he received the President's Award for Outstanding Contributions to the University of Florida.

He is also a proud graduate of Lake City Community College where he received his Associate of Arts degree, magna cum laude and was Phi Theta Kappa and made the President's and Dean's List. He completed 360 hours of training and education through the Lake City Community College Police Academy and graduated first in his class. He has since earned over 1750 continuing education hours in the criminal justice system.

Brannan worked in law enforcement for 29 years, including stints as a deputy U.S. Marshal and the chief investigator for the Baker County Sheriff's Office. He has also served as the president of the Macclenny Lions Club.

Running to succeed term-limited Rep. Elizabeth Porter, Brannan won the August 28, 2018 Republican primary, defeating Marc Vann. In the November 6, 2018 general election, Brannan easily defeated Democrat Ronald W. Williams II and two candidates with no party affiliation.

Brannan's wife, Lorelie, is a prosecutor with the State Attorney's Office and has worked in public service for over 13 years. She volunteers her time as a judge for Teen Court and as a mentor with Take Stock in Children among other community activities including serving as an officer in the Baker Conservative Women's Network, and playing piano with the children's choir at church.
