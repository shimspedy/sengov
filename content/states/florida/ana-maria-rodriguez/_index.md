Ana Maria Rodriguez is a prominent figure in Florida politics. She is a Republican member of the Florida Senate, representing the 40th district which encompasses Monroe and parts of Miami-Dade Counties since 2020. Prior to this, she served one term in the Florida House of Representatives, representing parts of Broward, Collier, and Miami-Dade counties from 2018 until her election to the Senate.

Born on May 23, 1977, in Miami, Florida, to Cuban parents, Ana Maria has lived her entire life in South Florida. She is well aware of the dangers of communist and socialist governments, having seen her parents' experiences. This has made her outspoken about the need to stop the spread of socialism in American politics.

Before entering politics, Ana Maria was a lobbyist for Baptist Health South Florida and the Miami Association of Realtors. She also served on the Doral City Council. Her political career began in earnest when she was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in the November 6, 2018 general election, narrowly defeating Democrat Javier Estevez.

In 2020, Ana Maria ran for the Florida Senate seat vacated by Anitere Flores, who was term-limited. She was unopposed in the Republican primary and defeated Democratic State Representative Javier Fernandez in the general election.

As a state legislator, Ana Maria has been involved in various committee assignments including Finance and Tax, Chair Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, Vice Chair Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee on Criminal and Civil Justice Military and Veterans Affairs, Space, and Domestic Security Reapportionment.

Ana Maria Rodriguez continues to serve the people of Florida with dedication and commitment, striving for a better future for all.
