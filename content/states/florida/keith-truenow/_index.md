Keith L. Truenow, born on August 9, 1969, in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is an American politician currently serving as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from the 26th district. He assumed office on November 9, 2022. Prior to this, he served as a member from the 31st district before being redistricted to the 26th as a result of the 2020 census.

Truenow moved to Florida with his family in 1979 and graduated from Leesburg High School. After graduation, he enlisted in the United States Air Force and served his country for the next four years. This military service was a significant part of his early life and career.

After his time in the Air Force, Truenow founded Lake Jem Farms, based in Mount Dora. In addition to being a farmer and rancher, he focuses on producing sod, which is sold throughout the State of Florida. His entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to agriculture have been key aspects of his career.

Truenow was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in November 2020. After assuming office, he was assigned to the House Judiciary Committee and House Joint Legislative Auditing Committee. His work in these committees has been instrumental in his political career.

In addition to his current role in the Florida House of Representatives, Truenow is running for election to the Florida State Senate to represent District 13. He declared his candidacy for the Republican primary scheduled on August 20, 2024.

Throughout his career, Truenow has shown a commitment to public service and a dedication to his community. His journey from a high school graduate in Leesburg, Florida, to a respected member of the Florida House of Representatives is a testament to his hard work and determination.
