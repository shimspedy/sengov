Barbara Muhammad Sharief, born on November 7, 1971, in Miami Beach, Florida, is an American politician and nurse who has made significant contributions to public service. She grew up in Miami and Broward County as one of eight children in a family where her father was a self-employed clothing salesman and her mother was a retired schoolteacher. Tragically, at the age of 14, Barbara's father was shot and killed by a 15-year-old robber, which led her to start working early to support her family.

Barbara attended North Miami Senior High School and later earned an Associate of Science in Nursing from Miami Dade Community College. She also received a registered nurse diploma from Jackson Memorial Hospital School of Nursing. Her educational journey continued at Florida International University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, a Master of Science in Nursing, and an advanced registered nurse practitioner certification. She later earned a Doctor of Nursing Practice from Wilkes University.

Barbara's career in nursing began at Jackson Memorial Hospital, followed by a position at a national home health agency. In 2001, she founded South Florida Pediatric Homecare, Inc., a company that provides home healthcare services for children and adults who would otherwise need to stay in a hospital or intensive care environment.

Barbara's political career took off in 2009 when she was elected to the Miramar City Commission. She served as the vice mayor in 2010 and donated her annual salary to charities during her tenure. In May 2010, she filed to run for the Broward County Commission District 8 seat and was elected in November 2010. She served the residents of Miramar, Pembroke Pines, Weston, Southwest Ranches, Hallandale Beach, Pembroke Park, and West Park. In 2012, she was named vice mayor of Broward County, and in November 2013, she became Broward's first African-American female mayor. She was re-elected to a second four-year term on the County Commission in November 2014 and was named vice mayor for the second time in November 2015. In November 2016, she was re-appointed mayor for the second time.

As a county commissioner, Barbara served on several boards, including the Broward County Metropolitan Planning Organization and the Large Urban County Caucus and the Health Steering Committee for the National Association of Counties. In 2024, Barbara was elected to the Florida State Senate, representing District 35. Her current term ends in 2028. She has been an influential figure in Florida politics, advocating for various issues and serving on multiple committees, including Banking and Insurance, Appropriations, and Children, Families, and Elder Affairs.

Barbara Sharief's dedication to public service and her community has made her a respected and influential figure in Florida politics. Her journey from a nurse to a successful politician is a testament to her resilience, determination, and commitment to making a difference in the lives of others.
