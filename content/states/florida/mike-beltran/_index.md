Political Career:
Beltran moved to Florida in 2010. He defeated Sean McCoy in the August 28, 2018 Republican primary, winning 53.2% of the vote. In the November 6, 2018 general election, Beltran won 55.27% of the vote, defeating Democrat Debbie Katt. He assumed office for the 70th district on November 8, 2022.

Legislative Actions:
Beltran, along with Senator Tom Lee, sponsored HB 225, which allows for graduating students to wear uniforms of the National Guard or United States Armed Forces at high school graduation ceremonies. He also sponsored HB 7027, which instituted restrictions on vaping. The bill stated that vaping in indoor spaces was prohibited, and that the act of vaping in, on, or within 1,000 feet of a school by any person under 18, was also prohibited.

Beltran acted as a cosponsor for other bills, including HB 7125, a bill which garnered attention for its “extensive reforms” to Florida's Criminal Justice System, with the goal of rehabilitation over incarceration and reallocation of funds. He also co-sponsored HB 843, which established the ability of outside physicians to inspect struggling programs and make recommendations.

In the 2020 Legislative Session, Beltran, along with the Justice Appropriations subcommittee and Rep. Clay Yarborough, sponsored HB 5301, a bill which established new county court and circuit court judges. This was in response to an order issued by the Florida Supreme Court. The bill passed unanimously, and consequentially added six county court judges and four new circuit court judges.
