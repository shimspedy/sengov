Clay Yarborough, born on February 6, 1981, in Mobile, Alabama, is an American politician who has been serving in the Florida Senate from the 4th district since 2022. He is a member of the Republican party.

Before his tenure in the Florida Senate, Yarborough served in the Florida House of Representatives from the 12th district from 2016 to 2022. Prior to that, he was a member of the Jacksonville City Council from the 1st district from 2007 to 2015.

Yarborough grew up in Northeast Florida and is a product of local public schools. He graduated from the University of North Florida with a Bachelor’s in Business Administration. During college, he worked at UPS as a truck loader and was later promoted into the HR department. In his role as an HR Supervisor, Clay hired over 1,800 people into manual and professional positions.

After 15 years with UPS, Clay accepted a position with First Coast Manufacturers Association and now works to strengthen the region’s manufacturing base and increase the number of good-paying jobs available to residents.

In March 2023, Yarborough introduced Florida Senate Bill 254 into the Florida Senate, which would grant the state of Florida "temporary emergency jurisdiction" over children "subjected to" or "threatened with being subjected to sex-reassignment prescriptions or procedures". The bill was met with strong disapproval from the ACLU, which said it was "designed to silence, harm, and erase trans people in Florida", and would "directly threaten transgender Floridians’ fundamental human rights and safety". The bill passed through the Florida Senate and Florida House of Representatives in April 2023.

Clay and his wife, Jordan, have four boys: twin eleven-year-olds, an eight-year-old, and a five-year-old. His priorities include making schools, communities, and the state as safe as possible, supporting economic growth and development, defending innocent life and parents’ abilities to make educational choices for their children, and keeping Florida open, free, and an attractive place to live, work, and raise a family.
