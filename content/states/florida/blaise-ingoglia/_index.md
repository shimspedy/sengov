Blaise Ingoglia, born on November 4, 1970, in Queens, New York, is an American politician who currently serves as a member of the Florida Senate, representing the 11th district since 2022. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Education and Early Career:
Ingoglia attended Queens College, where he studied economics and accounting, and Brooklyn College, where he studied biology. However, he did not graduate. In 1996, he moved to Spring Hill, Florida, and started the companies America One Mortgage and Hartland Homes.

Political Career:
Ingoglia's political career began in earnest in 2008 when he spent nearly fifty thousand dollars of his own money to unseat county commissioners that he felt were not offering property tax relief. His efforts were successful. In 2009, Ingoglia was elected as the Chairman of the Hernando County Republican Executive Committee, and in 2011, he was elected the Vice-Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. In 2016, he stepped down as Chairman of the Hernando County Republican Party when he was elected State Committeeman for Hernando County.

Florida House of Representatives:
In 2014, incumbent State Representative Robert C. Schenck was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, so Ingoglia ran to succeed him. He won the Republican primary unopposed and faced Democratic nominee Rose Rocco, a former Hernando County Commissioner, and independent candidates James Scavetta and Hamilton R. Hanson in the general election. Ultimately, Ingoglia defeated his opponents by a wide margin, winning 51% of the vote to Rocco's 42%, Scavetta's 4%, and Hanson's 3%.

Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida:
Following his election to the legislature, Ingoglia announced that he would seek election as the Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. He successfully challenged and defeated the incumbent Chairwoman, Leslie Dougher. He was reelected as state party chair in January 2017, defeating Christian Ziegler.

Florida Senate:
Ingoglia currently serves as a member of the Florida Senate, representing the 11th district, since 2022. In February 2023, Ingoglia introduced a bill that would eliminate the Florida Democratic Party.
