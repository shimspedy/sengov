Michael J. Grant was born on July 15, 1949, in Quincy, Massachusetts. He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he received his bachelor's degree in political science in 1972. He then attended Suffolk University, receiving his Master of Business Administration in 1980.

Grant moved to the state of Florida in 1988, where he founded Grant Medical Transportation. This company ended up acquiring Ambitrans, which became Southwest Florida's largest private ambulance company. He was appointed to the Charlotte County Airport Authority Commission by then-Governor Jeb Bush in 1998, and in 2000, he ran for re-election against pilot Frank Cvelbar. The race became a proxy battle over Airport Director Fred Watts' job performance and over whether the Charlotte County Airport should engage in non-aviation business agreements, which Grant favored. Grant ended up defeating Cvelbar in a landslide, winning re-election with 67% of the vote.

In 2004, incumbent State Representative Jerry Paul, who had been nominated by President George W. Bush as the Chief Operating Officer and Deputy Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, decided not to run for re-election to a third term in the legislature. Grant ran to succeed him in the 71st District, and Christopher King, an optometrist, opposed him in the Republican primary. The campaign was tightly fought, and in the end, Grant emerged narrowly victorious, defeating King by just 243 votes with 51% of the vote. In the general election, Grant faced Shaneen Wahl, the Democratic nominee, and Walter Augustinowicz, the Libertarian nominee.

Grant began serving as House majority leader in 2023. As of January 2020, he lived in Port Charlotte, Florida. He is a business owner and is married to Lorraine M. Butler of Boston, MA. They have three children: Vanessa, Christopher, and Nicholas. His recreational interests include boating, fitness, golf, reading, and tennis.
