Traci Koster was born on June 15, 1985, in Greensboro, North Carolina. She moved to Florida in 1988 and was raised in Pinellas and Hillsborough County, Florida. She graduated from Tarpon Springs High School.

Koster earned a Bachelor of Science degree in legal studies from the University of Central Florida and a Juris Doctor from the Stetson University College of Law. She is a family law attorney and co-founded Tampa Bay Pro Bono Partners.

In her political career, when incumbent Republican J. W. Grant resigned from the Florida House after being appointed Florida's chief information officer by Governor Ron DeSantis, Republican leaders in Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties designated Koster as Grant's replacement on the 2020 ballot. In the November general election, Koster defeated Democratic nominee Jessica Harrington.

She is currently serving as the state representative for District 64 in Florida. The district covers parts of Hillsborough County and Pinellas County. She assumed office on November 3, 2020, and her current term ends on November 5, 2024.

In her personal life, Koster is a Christian and has two children, Colton and Sadie.
