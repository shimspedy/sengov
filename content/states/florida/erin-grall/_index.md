Erin Grall is an American politician who was born on June 30, 1977, in Vero Beach, Florida. She is a member of the Republican party. She has served in the Florida House of Representatives from the 54th district from 2016 to 2022 and has been serving in the Florida Senate since 2022.

Grall has played an active role in the Florida Legislature, sponsoring a significant number of bills that have become law in recent years. In 2018, she voted against the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. The bill banned bump stocks, raised the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21, expanded the 3-day waiting period to rifles, and enacted red flag laws in the state.

In 2019, Grall introduced a bill to require minors to obtain consent by at least one parent prior to obtaining an abortion. Her bill passed the Florida House on April 17, 2019, but the bill stalled and eventually died in the more moderate Florida Senate. That same year, Grall introduced a parental rights bill that would recognize rights with regard to a "minor child's education, upbringing, & health care." It was not given a vote in the House.

In 2020, Grall reintroduced the parental consent for abortion bill and parents' rights legislation. After receiving the endorsement of Governor Ron DeSantis, the Legislature passed the abortion bill. It was signed on June 30, 2020. The parental rights bill again did not receive a vote.

In 2021, Grall reintroduced the Parents' Bill of Rights, legislation similar to what she had introduced in prior years. The bill passed the Legislature on April 22, and received the signature of DeSantis on June 29. Grall also introduced legislation to prohibit "disability abortion," though the Florida Senate did not take up the bill.

In 2022, Grall introduced HB 5, which prohibits abortions in the state after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for the life and physical health of the pregnant woman, as well as fatal fetal abnormalities. The bill passed, and DeSantis signed the legislation on April 14. In anticipation of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the legislation had an effective date of July 1. On June 24, 2022, the court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. The legislation was allowed to take effect as challenges in state court proceed.

Additionally, Grall and Alex Andrade introduced the Parental Rights in Education Act, which prohibits instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. After being elected to the Florida Senate in 2023, Grall introduced the Heartbeat Protection Act.
