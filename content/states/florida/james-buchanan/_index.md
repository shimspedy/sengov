James Vernon Buchanan, born on January 10, 1982, is an American politician in the state of Florida. He is a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives representing the state's 74th district, which includes part of Sarasota County.

Buchanan was born in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and moved to Florida in 1992. He is the son of U.S. Representative Vern Buchanan. He is married to Lea Buchanan of New York and they have three children: Lexington, Caroline, and Jesse James.

Buchanan received his Bachelor of Science degree in Finance and Entrepreneurship from Florida State University between 2001 and 2004. He later pursued an MBA in Management, International Business, and Advanced Finance from the University of South Florida between 2008 and 2009.

Before entering politics, Buchanan worked as a Real Estate Broker. His recreational interests include cycling, fishing, and outdoor activities.

In his first run for elected office, Buchanan was defeated by Democrat Margaret Good in a nationally publicized February 2018 special election to fill the 72nd district seat in the Florida House. Buchanan had previously been a candidate in the 71st district, but withdrew his candidacy.

Buchanan defeated Linda Yates in the August 28, 2018 Republican primary, winning 59.2% of the vote. In the November 6, 2018 general election, Buchanan won 56.91% of the vote, defeating Democrat Tony Mowry and a third candidate. This is the third State House district Buchanan has run for, and his first successful candidacy.

During his term, Buchanan has served on several committees including the Agriculture, Conservation & Resiliency Subcommittee as Chair, Ways & Means Committee as Vice Chair, Infrastructure Strategies Committee, State Affairs Committee, and Agriculture & Natural Resources Appropriations Subcommittee.
