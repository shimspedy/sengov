Vicki Lopez is an American politician who serves as a Republican member for the 113th district of the Florida House of Representatives. She was first elected in 2022.

Born in Tampa and raised in Fort Myers, Vicki's early life was marked by a significant event where her father was convicted of murdering his secretary's wife, but later had that sentence overturned on the grounds of self-defense. She attended the University of Notre Dame, marking the beginning of her journey into public service.

In November 1990, Vicki was elected to the Board of County Commissioners for Lee County, Florida. However, she resigned from this position in January 1993. A few years later, in 1997, she was convicted for honest services mail fraud and sentenced to 27 months in federal prison. Her sentence was commuted by President Bill Clinton in November 2000, after serving more than 15 months. The conviction was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in February 2011.

After her release, Vicki worked as an advocate under Governor Jeb Bush, specializing in criminal justice reform. She also took up leadership roles with the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. In 2011, she faced accusations of misusing the funds allocated for Florida juvenile detention facilities on office furniture and intercontinental phone bills, among other charges.

Despite these challenges, Vicki returned to elected office in August 2022, defeating Alberto Perosch in the Republican primary election for the 113th district of the Florida House of Representatives. In November 2022, she defeated Alessandro D'Amico in the general election, winning 51 percent of the votes.

On the personal front, Vicki married Sylvester Lukis in 1994. Lukis was a D.C. lobbyist, representing clients before the Lee County board. The couple's son, Donald Wolfe III, is the Chief of Staff for Miami City Mayor Francis Suarez. Vicki owns and runs VLL Consulting, a Florida-based government and public affairs firm.
