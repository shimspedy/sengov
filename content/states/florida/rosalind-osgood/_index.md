Rosalind Osgood is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Florida Senate, representing the 32nd district.. She is also the president and CEO of the non-profit Mount Olive Development Corp and has served on the Broward County School Board for more than a decade.

Born and raised in Broward County, Florida, Osgood graduated from Fort Lauderdale High School. She furthered her education by earning a master’s degree and a doctorate in public administration from Nova Southeastern University. In addition, she received a Master of Divinity from the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.

Osgood's political career began when she served as a member of the Broward County School Board from 2012 until 2022. She resigned from this position to run for a seat on the Florida State Senate. She successfully defeated Republican Joseph Carter in a special election to become state senator for Broward County’s Senate District 33 on March 8, 2022. During the 2022 redistricting process, Osgood’s district was renumbered 32 and its boundaries shifted to the south. Osgood is currently running for re-election to the Florida State Senate to represent District 32 and is on the ballot for the Democratic primary.

In addition to her work in public service, Osgood is an associate pastor of the New Mount Olive Baptist Church in Fort Lauderdale and the first female ordained minister in the church’s history. She serves as president and CEO of the Mount Olive Development Corp., the church’s community development arm. She operates her own ministry and, in 2013, became the first female chaplain for the City of Fort Lauderdale Police Department.
