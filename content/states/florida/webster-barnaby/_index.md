Webster Barnaby (born December 9, 1959) is an American politician who has served as the Florida State Representative since 2020. Initially, he represented the 27th district from 2020 until 2022. After redistricting, he has been representing the 29th district from 2022 until 2024. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Barnaby was born in Birmingham, England. He earned an associate degree in business from Birmingham Metropolitan College. After working in the hospitality industry in the United States Virgin Islands, Barnaby moved to Deltona, Florida in 1991. From 1994 to 2010, Barnaby worked as a district manager for National Write Your Congressman. He later served on the Deltona City Council from 2012 to 2020. A pastor, he has said opening prayers for several Donald Trump rallies.

Barnaby was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in November 2020. In March 2022, the Florida Supreme Court approved new legislative maps drawn by the state Legislature which redrew the maps for many Florida districts. Because of these changes, Barnaby ran for, and won, Florida House 29 on November 8, 2022. His current term in District 29 ends on November 5, 2024.

During an April 2023 debate on a bathroom bill, Barnaby referred to transgender people as "demons and imps" pretending to be part of this world, after comparing them to the mutants of the X-Men franchise. He later apologized for these remarks.

Barnaby became a naturalized American citizen in 1998. He and his wife, Silvia, have two children. He lives in Deltona, Florida and is the president of an LLC. His career experience includes working as the president of a business.
