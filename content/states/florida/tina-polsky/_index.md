Tina Scott Polsky was born on May 4, 1968, in Merrick, New York. She is an American politician serving as a Democratic member of the Florida Senate, representing the 30th district since 2020. Her Senate district includes parts of southern Palm Beach and northern Broward counties.

Polsky also served one term in the Florida House of Representatives, representing parts of western and southern Palm Beach County from 2018 to 2020. In 2018, Polsky was elected without opposition to Florida House District 81. After Senator Kevin Rader announced he would retire in 2020, Polsky ran to succeed him. She defeated former State Representative Irving Slosberg in the Democratic primary, 69% to 31%. Polsky then beat her Republican opponent, Brian Norton, 56% to 44% to win election to the Florida Senate, District 29.

During her 2020 election, Polsky was endorsed by several organizations including Ruth's List Florida, Florida AFL-CIO, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Moms Demand Action, Palm Beach Treasure Coast AFL-CIO, Palm Beach Post, WiNOW, AFSCME Florida, Associated Builders and Contractors, Florida East Coast, Palm Beach County Classroom Teachers Association, Florida Medical Association, SEIU Florida, Emily's List, Broward Teachers Union, Dolphin Democrats, Palm Beach County Human Rights Council, Equality Florida, Florida College Democrats, Ban Assault Weapons Now, The Hispanic Vote, Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus, Hispanic Political Action Committee of Florida, Sierra Club, and Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates.

In 2023, Polsky was the primary sponsor for SB 164 on controlled substance testing which passed unanimously through the Florida Legislature and was signed by the Governor. The bill decriminalized the use of fentanyl testing strips. Polsky commented that she hoped the measure would "reduce the risk of overdose [by allowing] a person using drugs to make an educated decision about their personal safety.‚Äù Polsky was a co-sponsor in the Senate for CS/HB 389, "Menstrual Hygiene Products in Public Schools" which aimed to increase availability and accessibility of menstrual hygiene products in schools.
