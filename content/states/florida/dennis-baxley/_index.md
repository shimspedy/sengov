Dennis K. Baxley, born on August 22, 1952, is a state legislator in Florida who has served in the Florida Senate since 2016. A Republican, he represents the 12th district including Sumter County and parts of Lake County and Marion County in Central Florida.

Baxley is a fifth-generation Floridian. He was born in Ocala and attended Central Florida Community College, graduating with an associate degree in 1972. He then attended Florida State University, receiving degrees in sociology and psychology in 1974. Following this, Baxley attended Miami-Dade Community College, where he received a degree in funeral service in 1975. He returned to Ocala, where he founded Hiers-Baxley Funeral Services. Baxley is a descendant of a soldier who fought for the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.

In his political career, Baxley was elected to the Belleview City Commission and later served as Mayor. When incumbent State Representative George Albright, was unable to seek re-election in 2000 due to term limits, he ran to succeed him in the 24th District, which included central Marion County. He faced George Onett in the Republican primary, whom he defeated easily, winning 86% of the vote. In the general election, Baxley defeated Judy Johnson, the Democratic nominee, with 58% of the vote.

Baxley served in the Florida House of Representatives, representing District 23 from 2010 to 2016. He has served as the president of Belleview Rotary Club and Belleview Chamber of Commerce. Baxley has sponsored anti-LGBT legislation and stand your ground legislation, opposed a two-year moratorium on the sale of AR-15s, and delayed the Florida Slavery Memorial. He also opposes the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials. He was the sponsor of the failed Florida House Bill H-837, which would have allowed students to sue educators for not tolerating their views, and the successful Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, which prohibits the discussion of gender identity in elementary schools.
