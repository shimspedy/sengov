Jason T. Brodeur is a Florida State Senator representing the 10th district, which consists of Seminole and a small part of Orange County. Before the redistricting that took effect with the 2022 election, he represented the old 9th district. A Republican, Brodeur also serves as the president and CEO of the Seminole County Chamber, which advocates for pro-business practices in Seminole County and across the state of Florida. He previously served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2010 to 2018. From 2010-2012, he represented the 33rd District. During his final six years in the Florida House, Brodeur represented the 28th District, which consists of eastern Seminole County.

Brodeur attended the University of Florida, where he graduated with a degree in food and resource economics in 1997 and a Masters of Business Administration in 2003 before attending Dartmouth College, where he completed a Master of Public Health Degree. During college, Brodeur participated in several student organizations and was a member of Florida Blue Key. Following graduation, he worked for Procter & Gamble for several years before starting his own health care consulting company. Brodeur later served as the Chairman of the Seminole County Republican Party.

Before assuming office, Brodeur received gubernatorial appointments and served on the Medicaid Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committee, the 18th Circuit Judicial Nominating Commission, and the Citizen’s Safety Task Force. When incumbent State Representative Sandy Adams opted to run for Congress in 2010, Brodeur ran in the Republican primary to succeed her from the 33rd District, which included parts of Orange, Seminole, and Volusia Counties. In the primary, he defeated Alice Sterling and James DeCocq, winning 51% of the vote to Sterling's 37% and DeCocq's 11%. Brodeur advanced to the general election, where he faced Democratic nominee Leo Cruz and Libertarian Franklin Perez. Brodeur defeated Cruz and Perez, winning nearly 60% of the vote.

In 2012, the Florida House districts were redrawn, and Brodeur opted to run for re-election in the 28th District. He was challenged in the Republican primary by former Winter Springs Mayor John F. Bush. Bush ran against Brodeur due to his opposition to an amendment that Brodeur wrote "blocking Seminole [County] from cutting programs or closing schools, and forcing administrators making over $100,000 to take steep pay cuts." Brodeur was elected to the Florida Senate in 2020. He has since been an extraordinarily effective lawmaker, sending over 20 bills to Governor’s DeSantis’s desk. This legislation includes expansions to the Right To Farm Act, more protections for foster children, the establishment of a statewide Office of Resilience to combat sea-level rise, additional homestead tax exemptions for teachers and First Responders, increasing access to mental health resources, and much more.
