Randy Fine, born on April 20, 1974, in Tucson, Arizona, is a prominent American Republican politician currently serving in the Florida Senate for the 19th district. He assumed office on November 5, 2024, succeeding Debbie Mayfield. Before his tenure in the Senate, Fine served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2016 to 2024, representing the 53rd district from 2016 to 2022 and the 33rd district from 2022 to 2024.

Fine's early life was marked by his upbringing in a Jewish family in Tucson. His father, H. Alan Fine, was a professor of engineering at the University of Kentucky. Randy Fine graduated from Henry Clay High School in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1992. During his high school years, he spent his 11th grade as a page in the U.S. House of Representatives and worked as an assistant for Robert Dornan during the summers of 1991 and 1992.

Fine pursued higher education at Harvard University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in government and an MBA. While at Harvard, he was active in student politics and faced accusations of election and financial improprieties. Before entering politics, Fine had a successful career in the gambling industry, working as an executive for casino companies such as Harrah's Entertainment and American Casino & Entertainment Properties. He also operated a Nevada-based consulting business for the casino industry called the Fine Point Group and served as the chief executive of the Greektown Casino in Detroit in 2009.

In 2015, Fine explored a bid for the U.S. Senate. He won four elections in Florida's 53rd and 33rd House of Representatives districts, competing against Democrat David Kearns in 2016, and Democrat Phil Moore in both 2018 and 2020. Following redistricting, Fine ran in the 33rd district in 2022, defeating Democrat Anthony Yantz.

During his tenure in the Florida House of Representatives, Fine was known for his advocacy in protecting the environment of the Indian River Lagoon from sewage spills and opposing what he saw as wasteful, lower-priority spending. He introduced a bill to provide up to $50 million per year in matching funds to upgrade sewage treatment facilities in the area of the marsh.

Fine is also recognized for his outspoken demeanor, strong support for Israel, and opposition to Drag Queens in Schools. He is currently the Republican nominee in the 2025 Florida's 6th congressional district special election.

Fine's personal life includes his marriage to Wendy Fine, with whom he has two children. His career and political journey reflect his commitment to his constituents and his dedication to addressing key issues in his district.
