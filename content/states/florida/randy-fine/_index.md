Randy Fine, born as Randall Adam Fine on April 20, 1974, in Tucson, Arizona, is an American Republican politician, activist, and former gambling industry executive. He was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016. His district covers southern Brevard County.

Fine was born into a Jewish family in Tucson, Arizona. His father, H. Alan Fine, a graduate of MIT, was a professor of engineering at the University of Kentucky. Fine was raised in Lexington, Kentucky, and graduated from Henry Clay High School in 1992. He spent his 11th-grade year in high school as a page in the US House of Representatives. During the summers of 1991 and 1992, he was an assistant for Robert Dornan.

Fine is a graduate of Harvard University. Before entering politics, Fine worked as an executive for casino gambling companies such as Harrah's Entertainment and American Casino & Entertainment Properties. For nearly ten years, he operated a Nevada-based consulting business for the casino industry, called The Fine Point Group. In 2009, he was the chief executive of the Greektown Casino in Detroit.

In 2015, Fine explored a US Senate bid. Fine has won four elections in Florida's 53rd and 33rd House of Representatives districts. In 2016, Fine and David Kearns (Democrat) competed for the seat being vacated by John Tobia, who vacated the spot due to term limits. In 2018 and 2020 Fine was the incumbent, and he was challenged by Democrat Phil Moore in both elections. Following redistricting, Fine ran in the 33rd district in 2022, defeating Democrat Anthony Yantz.

In the state legislature, Fine has been an advocate for protecting the environment of the Indian River Lagoon from sewage spills, and for opposing what he sees as wasteful, lower-priority spending. Fine has introduced a bill in the state legislature to provide up to $50 million per year in matching funds to upgrade sewage treatment facilities in the area of the marsh. The legislation also increases the fines for illegal sewage discharges. Despite his crusade against sewage spills, in 2019 he voted for HB 829 which made it illegal for local communities to ban the spreading of biosolids (dried sewage) on farmlands that drain into the St. John's River and The Indian River Lagoon.
