Debbie Mayfield, born on December 2, 1956, is a distinguished American politician affiliated with the Republican Party. She has been serving as a member of the Florida Senate, representing the 19th district, which includes part of Brevard county, since 2022.

Born and raised in Pensacola, Florida, Mayfield attended Pensacola High School. In 1989, she relocated to Vero Beach and embarked on a career with Barnett Bank. Over time, she climbed the corporate ladder to become the Senior Vice-President of Residential Lending. Eventually, she left the bank to establish the Mayfield Group, a mortgage brokerage firm that she owned and operated.

Before her tenure in the Florida Senate, Mayfield served four terms in the Florida House of Representatives from 2008 to 2016, representing parts of the Treasure Coast. She also held the position of Majority Leader from 2020 to 2022.

When incumbent State Representative Stan Mayfield, her husband, was unable to seek re-election in 2008 due to term limits, she ran to succeed him in the 80th District, which ran along the Treasure Coast, including northern St. Lucie County, eastern Indian River County, and southeastern Brevard County. She won the Republican primary unopposed, and advanced to the general election, where she faced Neal Abarbanell, the Democratic nominee. During the course of the campaign, Mayfield's husband, who was running for Indian River County Tax Collector, died of cancer. Despite this, Mayfield ended up defeating Abarbanell by a wide margin of victory, winning 64% of the vote.

In 2016, Mayfield ran for the Florida Senate seat vacated by Thad Altman, who was term limited. She defeated fellow state representative Ritch Workman in the Republican primary, 42 to 35%, and Democrat Amy Tidd in the general election, 62 to 38%.

Mayfield's career experience includes working as a banking executive. She has been affiliated with Republican Women of Indian River County, Brevard Federated Republican Women, Professional Republican Women and Mothers, Ascension Catholic Women, and the NRA.
