Robin Bartleman, born on August 27, 1972, is an American legislator and educator currently serving as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from the 103rd district. She assumed office on November 3, 2020.

She is a Democrat, supporting affordable housing, resolving the state's property insurance crisis, dealing with flooding, and increasing healthcare affordability.

Education:
Bartleman earned a Bachelor of Science degree in emotionally handicapped education from Florida International University in 1994 and a Master of Science in emotional disturbance education from Nova Southeastern University.

Career:
Bartleman has worked as a special education teacher and assistant school principal in the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami. Bartleman served one term as a Commissioner for the City of Weston, Florida, from 2000 to 2004.

School Board:
Bartleman was a member of the Broward County School Board, representing a countywide seat, for 16 years, from 2004 to 2020. She was first elected in 2004 and was re-elected in 2008, 2012, and 2016. She was also an advocate for children with disabilities, having been a teacher in the exceptional student educations (ESE) program in Miami for several years.

Florida House:
She was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in November 2020, succeeding Richard Stark. In the House, she is a ranking member on the healthcare regulation subcommittee and also serves on the local administrations, federal affairs and special districts subcommittee of the State Affairs Committee, as well as the agriculture, conservation and resiliency subcommittee and the health care appropriations subcommittee.

The old 104th district included Pembroke Pines, Weston, Southwest Ranches, and the Everglades Wildlife Management Area. In 2022, she was re-elected to the redrawn 103rd district, defeating Republican George Navarini in a rematch of the 2020 election, even as a "red wave" overtook much of Florida. Her campaign manager was Barbara Miller of Hallandale Beach.

The new district moved south and west and now incorporates all of Broward County east of U.S.-27, south and west of I-75, along with a slice of Pembroke Pines from Sheridan Street to Pembroke Road out to SW 136 Ave. Cities in the district include Weston, Pembroke Pines, Southwest Ranches, Miramar, Sunrise, and Davie.

Bills passed and signed into law:
Miya's Law: The legislation is named in honor of Miya Marcano, a college student who was killed in her apartment in Orlando. The perpetrator, a maintenance worker with a criminal record, allegedly entered her unit using a master key. Miya's Law aims to improve safety measures for the approximately 2 million renters in the state by requiring apartment complexes to conduct background checks on employees who have access to tenants' homes, extending the notice period for maintenance worker entry from 12 to 24 hours, establishing policies for the issuance and return of master keys, and maintaining a log of employees who enter units.
