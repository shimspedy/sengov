Hillary Cassel is a member of the Florida House of Representatives from the 101st district. She assumed office on November 8, 2022, succeeding Marie Woodson.

Born as Hillary Paige Brisson in Boynton Beach, Florida, U.S., she is a proud Democrat, mental health care advocate, and co-founder of the law firm Cassel & Cassel, P.A. She was born and raised in South Florida and is a product of Florida public schools.

She is currently serving her term from 2022 to 2024 under Speaker Renner. Her legislative aide is Noah Bennett and her district aide is Connie Furze. She is part of several committees including the Infrastructure Strategies Committee, Agriculture, Conservation & Resiliency Subcommittee, Water Quality, Supply & Treatment Subcommittee, Select Committee on Hurricane Resiliency & Recovery, Agriculture & Natural Resources Appropriations Subcommittee, and Energy, Communications & Cybersecurity Subcommittee.

Hillary resides in Dania Beach and is an attorney by profession. She is married to Michael Cassel and they have a child named Shepard Cassel. She completed her AA from Tallahassee Community College (1999-2001), BS from Florida State University (2001-2003), and JD from Nova Southeastern University, Shepard Broad Law School (2003-2006). During her time at law school, she was the Chief Advocate of the Moot Court Honor Society.

Her career began as an assistant state attorney in the 17th Circuit State Attorney's Office (2006-2009). She then worked as an associate at Berk, Merchant, & Sims (2010-2013), and as a senior associate at an insurance defense firm (2012-2014). It was during this time that she met her husband and law partner, Michael. She was a partner at Geyer Fuxa Tyler (2014-2017) before establishing Cassel & Cassel in 2017.

Despite being a freshman legislator, Rep. Cassel was placed in the spotlight by the Democratic Caucus during the 2022 special session related to the Florida property insurance market due to her expertise in the subject matter. She presented closing arguments in both the commerce committee as an ex officio member and floor debate during the house session on behalf of the caucus. She further provided closing remarks during the post-session press conference along with House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell. Less than 24 hours after Rep. Cassel spoke to Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier's role in the insurance legislation passed during the special session, Mr. Altmaier resigned as Florida's Insurance Commissioner.

Hillary Cassel is a dedicated public servant with a strong commitment to her community and the state of Florida.
