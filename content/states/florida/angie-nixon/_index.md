Angie Nixon is an American politician and community organizer from Jacksonville, Florida. She currently serves in the Florida House of Representatives. Nixon is also the Director for the Florida Public Service Union's (FPSU) Higher Education Campaign and was previously the Florida state field director for the Service Employees International Union, of which FPSU is an affiliate.

Nixon is a native of Jacksonville and a graduate of Stanton College Preparatory School and the University of Florida. She formerly worked as an aide to Mia L. Jones when Jones was the representative from the 14th district.

As a community organizer, Nixon is the organizer and co-founder of the Melanin Market, which provides small business owners with resources to grow their businesses, provides healthy food options in a food desert, and connects residents to resources and services needed to enhance their quality of life.

In terms of health and literacy, Nixon co-authored a book with her daughter, Natalie McGriff. When Natalie was 7, in response to her low self-esteem about her natural hair, Nixon suggested the two write a comic-style children's book about a girl whose Afro puffs transform her into a powerful superhero. The Adventures of Moxie McGriff was born. The book won Florida's One Spark where they received enough funding to publish and tour the book, donating many copies to organizations that promote literacy. Nixon, along with her daughter, opened and operate a smoothie/ice cream/sandwich shop on the Eastside of Jacksonville called Natalieâ€™s Nook & Candy Shop. The goal is for their restaurant, is to bring healthy food options to the food insecure neighborhood.

In the 2020 elections, Nixon defeated incumbent Kimberly Daniels, who was seeking re-election to the Florida House of Representatives District 14 (part of Duval County), in the Democratic Party primary election. In the heavily-Democratic 14th district, this nomination is tantamount to election. In April 2022, Nixon attempted to stage a sit-in demonstration to prevent a vote on Florida's congressional district maps. The demonstration was ultimately unsuccessful. In 2022, Nixon was redrawn from House District 14 to House District 13 thanks to once-in-a-decade re-districting. She went on to defeat unaffiliated candidate La'Ciara Masline, NPA and on to replace Tracie Davis as Florida state House representative for District 13. On November 9, 2023, Nixon introduced a resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of hostages by Hamas. The Florida State House voted 104-2 to reject the resolution.
