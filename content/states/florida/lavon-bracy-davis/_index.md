LaVon Bracy Davis is an American attorney and politician currently serving as a member of the Florida House of Representatives for the 40th district. She assumed office on November 8, 2022.

Born in Rochester, New York, Davis has a brother, Randolph Bracy, who is a former state senator. Her educational journey took her to Howard University where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. She later pursued law at Florida A&M University, earning a Juris Doctor degree.

Before her political career, Davis served as a senior attorney for the Florida Department of Children and Families. She also joined the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts as director of community programming. Her love for the arts can be traced back to her high school days at Dr. Phillips High School where she actively participated in the visual and performing arts magnet program.

Davis was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in November 2022. As a representative, she has been an advocate and community leader from West Orange County. Her current term ends on November 5, 2024, and she has declared her candidacy for the Democratic primary scheduled on August 20, 2024.

In addition to her political and legal career, Davis is also an arts administrator and advocate, and a cultural programmer. Her work in these areas reflects her commitment to community engagement and the promotion of arts and culture.
