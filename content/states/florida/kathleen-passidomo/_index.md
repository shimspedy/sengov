Kathleen C. Passidomo, born on May 19, 1953, is an American lawyer and politician currently serving as President of the Florida Senate. She is a member of the Republican party and has represented the 28th district, which includes Collier, Hendry, and part of Lee County in Southwest Florida, since 2016.

Passidomo was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and attended Trinity Washington University in Washington, D.C., graduating with a Bachelor's degree in 1975. She graduated from the Stetson University College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1978 after moving to the state of Florida in 1976. She has resided in Naples since 1979.

She entered into private law practice and is a founding partner of the law firm of Kelly, Passidomo & Alba LLP. In 2010, when incumbent Republican State Representative Tom Grady declined to seek another term in the legislature, Passidomo ran to succeed him in the 76th District, which stretched from Naples Park to Chokoloskee on the western coast of Collier County. She won both the Republican primary and the general election entirely unopposed.

Following the reconfiguration of legislative districts in 2012, Passidomo was moved into the 106th District, which included most of the territory that she had previously represented in Collier County. In the Republican primary, she was opposed by David Bolduc, whom she easily defeated with 73% of the vote. Advancing to the general election, Passidomo faced Libertarian candidate Peter Richter, whom she defeated in a landslide, winning her second term in the legislature with 79% of the vote.

In 2016, Passidomo ran for the Florida Senate District 28 seat vacated by Garrett Richter, who was term limited. She defeated state representative Matt Hudson in the Republican primary, 58% to 42%, and faced only write-in candidates in the general election. Passidomo was re-elected to a second term on November 6, 2018, after facing no primary challenger and winning 65% of the vote in the general election.

She served as Senate Majority Leader from 2018 to 2020 and Senate Rules Chair from 2020 to 2022. As of now, she is serving as the President of the Florida Senate.
