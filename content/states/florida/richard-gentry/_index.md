Richard Gentry is a Florida native, born in Volusia County, and has spent the last dozen years living between Astor and Tallahassee. The Gentry Family has a long history in our community. Richard’s father grew up in DeLand and built Gentry’s Fruits and Juices company from the ground up. His brother founded Gentry Fuel Oil, a company still in existence today. Richard has spent his adult life working to make Florida a better place to live, work, and play. Most recently, Richard served as a watchdog for Floridians, advocating for citizens’ interests before the Public Service Commission. Prior to that role, Richard worked with communities and builders to shape some of the most significant housing and growth related laws including Florida’s landmark Growth Management Act, the Sadowski Act which works to make housing more affordable for nurses, teachers, first responders and hard-working families.

Gentry attended college and Law School at the University of Miami. He is also a graduate of Leadership Florida, a state-wide nonprofit recognized for cultivating and connecting Florida’s best and brightest leaders. Richard and his wife, Carol, live in Astor and have five grown children, and four grandchildren.
