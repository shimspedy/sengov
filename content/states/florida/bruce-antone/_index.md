Bruce Hadley Antone was born on November 1, 1960, in Mobile, Alabama. He is an American politician from Florida and a member of the Democratic Party. Antone has served in the Florida House of Representatives multiple times. His first term was from 2002 to 2006, then from 2012 to 2020, and he assumed office again in 2022. He represents parts of Orlando in Orange County.

Antone attended Tuskegee University, where he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering in 1983. After graduation, he started graduate studies in electrical engineering but moved to Florida in 1984. In Florida, he pursued graduate studies in public administration at the University of Central Florida, but he did not graduate.

Before his political career, Antone worked as a legislative aide to State Senator Buddy Dyer from 1992 to 1999, including serving as his chief of staff. He also ran for a seat on the Orange County Commission from the 6th District but received only 9% of the vote.

In 2000, when incumbent State Representative Alzo J. Reddick did not seek re-election, Antone ran to succeed him. He earned the endorsement of the Orlando Sentinel, which praised him as the "best equipped" candidate. However, he ultimately lost to Gary Siplin and Wardell Sims, who advanced to a runoff election, winning 27% of the vote.

When Siplin decided to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election, Antone ran to succeed him in the 39th District, which stretched from downtown Orlando to Pine Hills. In the Democratic primary, he faced Tiffany Moore-Russell, Geraldine F. Thompson, and Jon Eason, whom he defeated with 34% of the vote. He advanced to the general election, where he faced Janet Buckles, the Republican nominee. Antone emphasized that, unlike Siplin, he would focus on passing bills into law while serving in the legislature and would not waste his time on "feel-good" efforts. Antone defeated Buckles easily, winning 75% of the vote.

In 2004, when he ran for re-election, he was opposed in the primary election by Tiffany Moore-Russell, once again, and Fritz Seide Jackson. Antone expanded his margin of victory from 2002, and won renomination with 52% of the vote to Moore-Russell's 39% and Jackson's 9%. He faced Thomas J. Kelly, the nominee of the British Reformed Sectarian Party, in the general election, whom he handily defeated with 90% of the vote.

Antone is currently serving as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing District 41. He assumed office on November 8, 2022. His current term ends on November 5, 2024. Antone is running for re-election to the Florida House of Representatives to represent District 41. He declared candidacy for the Democratic primary scheduled on August 20, 2024.
