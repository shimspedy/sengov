Susan Plasencia is a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing District 37. She assumed office on November 8, 2022, and her current term ends on November 5, 2024. She is a member of the Republican Party and is running for re-election to the Florida House of Representatives to represent District 37.

Susan Plasencia was born in Los Angeles, California, and now resides in Orlando, Florida. Her career experience includes owning a business and working as a producer. She is also the daughter of a Cuban immigrant father who fled Communism and a Puerto Rican mother. The Central Florida Community means a great deal to her as she has called it home for 25 years. This is where she raised her children, attends church, and runs the family business alongside her father.

As a State Representative, Susan Plasencia pledges to continue waking up every day to do her part to strengthen families, the state, and the community. She believes that the community needs a leader who will champion job creation and make decisions that will foster a stronger economy. She also supports law enforcement officers and joins them in creating safer schools and communities.

In addition to her political career, Susan Plasencia is a mother of three children and a business owner. She understands the struggles of financial hardship and is committed to helping others pull through these tough times. She is a strong advocate for school choice vouchers, which she believes played a crucial role in her children's education.
