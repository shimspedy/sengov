Bob Rommel is a no-nonsense politician who was born and raised in Keyport, New Jersey. He grew up in a small town where many families struggled to survive. His parents instilled in him the values of hard work, patriotism, and respect for others. These values shaped him and led him to great success in life.

In 2002, Bob sold the mortgage company he and his business partner had founded. The company had offices in New Jersey, Florida, California, and Pennsylvania and grew to 120 employees in just five years. This business venture led him and his wife Sandra to spend more time in Southwest Florida until they eventually made Naples their full-time home.

Bob and his business partner now own and operate restaurants where they pride themselves on offering each customer consistent culinary cuisine and accommodating professional service. At the heart of Bob’s business philosophy is always to do what’s right and treat everyone with respect.

An unabashed conservative, Bob is the past President of the Caxambas Republican Club and a member of the Collier County Republican Party. Bob lives in Naples with his wife Sandra and their dog Ginger. They are both very active in numerous charities.

Bob has demonstrated leadership in his family, business, and community. He served in the Florida State House of Representatives for 8 years and ended his career in that chamber as the Chairman of the House Commerce Committee where he championed tax and regulatory reforms for small businesses and consumers.

Now, Bob is ready to take his legislative experience, business acumen, and conservative philosophy to the State Senate where he will continue the fight to keep us the Free State of Florida.
