James Vernon Mooney Jr., known as Jim Mooney, is an American politician who serves in the Florida House of Representatives from the 120th district as a member of the Republican Party. He assumed office on November 3, 2020. His current term ends on November 5, 2024.

Born in Miami, Florida, Mooney graduated from the University of Miami with a bachelor's degree. Prior to his tenure in the state house, he was active in local politics in Islamorada, Florida. Mooney served on the council in Islamorada, Florida, from 1998 to 2002, and during his tenure, he served as mayor for one year. He defeated incumbent councilor Ken Philipson for a seat on the Islamorada council from the third district in the 2014 election.

Holly Merrill Raschein, the incumbent member of the Florida House of Representatives from the 120th district, was term-limited during the 2020 election and Mooney announced that he would run for the Republican nomination to succeed her in 2019. During the primary, he was endorsed by Raschein. Mooney defeated Rhonda Rebman Lopez and Alexandria Suarez in the primary and defeated Democratic nominee Clint Barras in the general election.

During Mooney's tenure in the state house, he served on the Environment, Agriculture and Flooding, Infrastructure and Tourism, and the Early Learning and Elementary Education subcommittees. He ran for re-election to the Florida House of Representatives to represent District 120 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

In addition to his political career, Mooney also has experience working as a realtor and owning a business.
