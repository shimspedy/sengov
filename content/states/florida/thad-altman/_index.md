Thad Altman (born September 8, 1955) is a Republican politician who currently serves as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing parts of the Melbourne area in central Brevard County since 2016. Previously, he represented a similar area in the House from 2003 to 2008, and served in the Florida Senate from 2008 to 2016.

Altman was born in Macon, Georgia in 1955, and moved to Florida in 1957. He attended the University of Houston, where he played baseball, though he ultimately graduated from Brevard Community College with his associate degree and from Rollins College with his bachelor's degree.

In 1984, Altman ran for the Brevard County Commission in the 5th District. He faced Eldon Moen, Norm Crank, and J. Preston Silvernail in the Republican primary, and received the most votes, winning 47% of the vote. However, because no candidate won a majority, Altman and the second-place finisher, Moen, competed in a runoff election that Altman won by a wide margin, receiving 63% of the vote to Moen's 37%. In the general election, Altman was opposed by Ed Rainis, the Democratic nominee. Altman won his first term in a landslide, winning 61% of the vote to Rainis's 39%.

When Altman ran for re-election in 1988, he was opposed by Ed Washburn, a city planner and the Democratic nominee. Altman campaigned on his environmental record, specifically efforts to restrict coastal building, reducing densities on beaches, creating no-wake zones for boats in manatee habitats, and a countywide growth management plan. Washburn attacked Altman for "irresponsibly" squandering the county's $18 million reserve fund, noting, "They've mishandled the financial situation. We need to reduce irresponsible government spending and subsequent tax increases."

Altman's personal details include his occupation as a Foundation President. He is married to Mary Pat Altman of Rockledge, Florida and they have three children: McKenzie, Hunter, and Sullivan. He received his AA from Eastern Florida State College in 1977 and his BS from Rollins College in 1987. He moved to Florida in 1957 and his recreational interests include biking, family activities, hiking, and paddling.
