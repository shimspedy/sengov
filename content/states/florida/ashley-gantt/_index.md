Ashley Viola Gantt, born on April 14, 1985, is an American lawyer, politician, and former schoolteacher. She is currently serving as the District 109 Representative in the Florida House of Representatives.

Gantt was born and raised in Florida. She pursued her higher education at the University of Florida, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in English in 2007. After her undergraduate studies, she joined the Teach For America Mississippi Delta Corps, where she served for two years.

Following her stint with Teach For America, Gantt returned to Florida and spent six years teaching at middle and high schools in Miami-Dade County Public Schools. During this time, she developed a passion for law and decided to further her education. She enrolled at the Shepard Broad College of Law at Nova Southeastern University, where she completed her Juris Doctor degree in 2016.

After law school, Gantt began her political career. She was critical of incumbent representative James Bush for voting with Republicans on the recent abortion ban legislation and the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act. Her criticisms resonated with the public, and on August 23, 2022, she won the Democratic primary for District 109.

Gantt's campaign was backed by the Service Employees International Union and Ruthâ€™s List Florida. She had no opponents in the general election, and she assumed office on November 8, 2022. Since then, she has been serving as the District 109 Representative in the Florida House of Representatives.

In addition to her political career, Gantt is also an attorney and the owner of a law firm. She has dedicated her career to serving her community, from the classroom to the courtroom, and hopes to bring her experiences to Tallahassee to advocate for the residents of her district.
