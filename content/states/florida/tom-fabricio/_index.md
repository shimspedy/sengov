Tom Fabricio is an American attorney and politician serving as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from the 110th district. This district includes the Town of Miami Lakes, Palm Springs North, the Country Club of Miami, and Hialeah. He assumed office on November 3, 2020.

Fabricio was born in Miami, Florida. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in world literatures and political science from Marymount Manhattan College in 2005 and a Juris Doctor from the Shepard Broad College of Law at Nova Southeastern University in 2008.

In 2006, Fabricio was a law clerk for the Florida Third District Court of Appeal. From 2011 to 2017, he was an associate at Walton Lantaff Schroeder & Carson LLP. In 2017 and 2018, he was an attorney at Mintzer Sarowitz Zeris Ledva & Meyers LLP. From 2016 to 2018, Fabricio was a member of the Broward County Charter Review Commission.

He was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in November 2020. He is a member of the House Commerce Committee. Mr. Fabricio is a litigator and the managing partner of The Fabricio Law Firm, P.A., as well as an owner of True Freedom Title, LLC.

Fabricio first ran for the State House because he believed we must strengthen the American Dream and preserve it as a reality for future generations. Public service is the hallmark of Tom’s career. After earning his law degree, he became involved in various community activities, from planning and zoning to parks. He received Hands On Miami’s Volunteer Leader of the Year Award for his volunteer work with several organizations throughout the Miami area, principally with inner city and at-risk youth groups. He also serves on the board of his alma mater, Marymount Manhattan College.

Tom practices law in the field of insurance defense, where he works to protect businesses and consumers. Most importantly, he’s a proud husband and father of two daughters.
