Mike Caruso is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Republican Party. He was born on September 14, 1958, in Washington, D.C. He later moved to Florida in 1986 and has been a resident of Delray Beach, Florida.

Caruso is a certified public accountant by profession. He earned his bachelor's degree in accounting from George Washington University. His career experience includes working as a co-chair of the WARC Economic Committee, a member of the Delray Beach Police Advisory Board, and the president of the Villas of Ocean Crest Homeowners Association.

In terms of his political career, Caruso has served in the Florida House of Representatives from two districts. He first served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from the 89th district from November 6, 2018, to November 8, 2022. He succeeded Bill Hager and was later succeeded by David Silvers.

Currently, Caruso is serving as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from the 87th district. He assumed office on November 8, 2022, after being redistricted. The previous representative from this district was David Silvers.

During his tenure, Caruso has faced both victories and controversies. In the August 28, 2018 Republican primary, he defeated Matt Spritz, winning 56.2% of the vote. In the November 6, 2018 general election, Caruso was narrowly elected with 50.02% of the vote, defeating Democrat Jim Bonfiglio. His margin of victory was just 32 votes, which triggered both a machine and manual recount under Florida law.

In the 2022 Election, Caruso endorsed Katherine Waldron in the Democratic primary for an open Florida House seat. This move drew criticism from local Republicans. In response to the endorsement, the Palm Beach County Republican Executive Committee voted to censure him. In his defense, Caruso argued that his endorsement only applied to the primary election and that he felt compelled to do so because of the work they did together to help bring hurricane relief to the Bahamas.

Despite the challenges, Caruso continues to serve his constituents with dedication and integrity. His commitment to public service is evident in his work and he continues to make a positive impact in his community.
