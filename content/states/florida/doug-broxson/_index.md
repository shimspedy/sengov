Douglas Vaughn Broxson, born on March 10, 1949, is an American politician who is a Republican member of the Florida Senate. He represents the 1st district, which includes Escambia, Santa Rosa, and part of Okaloosa Counties in the Florida Panhandle, since 2016.

Broxson was born in Pensacola, Florida. After attending Pensacola Junior College, Broxson transferred to Evangel University in Springfield, Missouri, where he met his wife, Mary, and graduated in 1971. He moved back to Florida and raised his family, starting a career in real estate and insurance sales.

Before his tenure in the Florida Senate, Broxson served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2010 to 2016. He represented the 1st district from 2010 to 2012 and the 3rd district from 2012 to 2016. His journey in politics began in 2010 when incumbent state representative Greg Evers could not seek re-election due to term limits. Broxson ran to succeed him in the Republican primary in the 1st District and won with 45% of the vote. In the general election, Broxson defeated independent candidate Matthias Venditto and won in a landslide, receiving 84% of the vote.

When Florida House districts were reconfigured in 2012, Broxson ran in the newly created 3rd District. He faced Jayer Williamson, the son of Santa Rosa County commissioner Jim Williamson, in the Republican primary, and won with 58% of the vote. He did not face an opponent in the general election and won in a landslide.

Throughout his political career, Broxson has served on various committees including Appropriations (Chair), Appropriations Committee on Education, Banking, Insurance, Finance and Tax, Judiciary, Rules, Transportation, and Joint Legislative Budget Commission (Alternating Chair).

Broxson's professional experience includes working as an insurance executive and in real estate. He continues to serve the people of Florida with dedication and commitment.
