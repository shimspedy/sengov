Corey Jermaine Simon Sr., born on March 2, 1977, in Pompano Beach, Florida, is an American politician and former professional football player. He is a member of the Republican Party and has been serving as the Florida State Senator from the 3rd district since 2022.

Before his political career, Simon was a professional football player. He played as a defensive tackle for eight seasons in the National Football League (NFL). His college football career was at Florida State University, where he earned consensus All-American honors and was a member of a BCS National Championship team. He was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles with the sixth overall pick in the 2000 NFL Draft, and he played professionally for the Eagles, Indianapolis Colts, and Tennessee Titans. He was selected to the 2004 Pro Bowl.

Simon was born in Pompano Beach, Florida. He attended Blanche Ely High School, where he played for the Ely Mighty Tigers high school football team. As a senior, he was the Miami Herald's defensive player of the year, named to the All-USA squad by USA Today, and a Super Prep Dream Team selection.

Simon accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Florida State University, where he played for coach Bobby Bowden's Seminoles teams from 1996 to 1999. He was considered to be the most dominating defensive lineman in college football. Following his senior season, Simon was a first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) selection, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. He was also a finalist for the Lombardi Award and Outland Trophy.

After his football career, Simon transitioned into politics. He was elected to the Florida Senate in 2022 for the Florida Senate District 3. Prior to that, he served as the Chief Executive Officer of Volunteer Florida, appointed by Governor DeSantis in December 2020.
