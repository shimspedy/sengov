Kathy L. Rapp was born on February 23, 1951, in Sligo, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Warren Area High School in 1969 and later attended Bryant & Stratton College. She earned her paralegal certification from Slippery Rock State College.

Before her political career, Rapp served as a community relations representative with Beverly Health Care in Warren, Pennsylvania. She volunteered for the Parent Education Network in York, Pennsylvania. She also worked as a compliance monitor with the Pennsylvania Department of Education, where she helped examine special education programs and served as a consultant with the Parent Education Network.

Rapp was first elected to represent the 65th District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2004. She has since won re-election to nine more consecutive terms. Rapp was "very much" opposed to legalizing medical cannabis in Pennsylvania, believing that it could open the door to full adult use cannabis legalization. In 2020, Rapp was among 26 Pennsylvania House Republicans who called for the reversal of Joe Biden's certification as the winner of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 United States presidential election, citing false claims of election irregularities.

Rapp lives in Warren, Pennsylvania. She has three children and seven grandchildren.
