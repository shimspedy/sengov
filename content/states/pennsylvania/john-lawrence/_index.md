John Lawrence is a dedicated public servant who has been serving the people of the 13th Legislative District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He was first elected to this position in 2010. A lifelong resident of southern Chester County, John is committed to bringing a common sense, reform-minded approach towards governing.

The 13th Legislative District is comprised of parts of Chester County, including the townships of East Nottingham, Elk, Franklin, Highland, London Britain, London Grove, Londonderry, Lower Oxford, New London, Penn, Upper Oxford, West Fallowfield, and West Nottingham, as well as the boroughs of Oxford and West Grove.

Throughout his tenure, John Lawrence has been involved in several significant legislative actions and initiatives. He authored Act 102 of 2018, which eliminated the possibility of domestic violence victims being required to financially support their convicted abuser. This act is a testament to his commitment to justice and the welfare of his constituents.

In addition to his legislative duties, John Lawrence has been active in advocating for local municipal water projects. In December 2023, he announced the approval of $1.1 million in state grants for municipal water infrastructure improvements across southern Chester County.

John Lawrence has also been vocal about fiscal responsibility and tax reform. In October 2023, he called out a partisan vote approving what he termed a "punitive and aggressive" tax proposal. This proposal included a complete rewrite of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s business tax code and new tax incentives for medical marijuana operations and Hollywood movie studios.

In September 2023, John Lawrence issued a statement urging Governor Josh Shapiro to rescind a recent executive action regarding automatic voter registration. He has consistently shown his commitment to fair and transparent governance.

John Lawrence's dedication to his constituents and his commitment to improving the lives of the people in his district make him a valued member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.
