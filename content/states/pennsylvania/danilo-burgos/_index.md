Danilo Burgos is an American politician serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 197th district. He was elected to serve his first term in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in November 2018, representing neighborhoods in north Philadelphia including Kensington, Hunting Park, Glenwood, and Feltonville. He is the first Dominican elected to serve in the Pennsylvania General Assembly.

Burgos is a first-generation Hispanic American and was born in New York City. His family moved to Philadelphia in 1990 when he was 10 years old. They attended St. Veronica’s Church and owned and operated a grocery store in the Hunting Park neighborhood in the early 1990s.

Burgos attended Roberto Clemente Middle School and graduated from Olney High School in 1997. In 1998, he opened up his first grocery store in north Philadelphia and that same year, along with several grocery store owners, he co-founded the Dominican Grocers Association of Philadelphia (D.G.A.P.) in partnership with the Eastern Pennsylvania Organizing Project (EPOP). Since 1999, the organization has grown to more than 385 members.

Prior to joining the state legislature, Burgos served as Director of Zoning and Business Development for Philadelphia Councilwoman María Quiñones-Sánchez, where he oversaw the expansion of St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children and Allegheny General Hospital as well as developed and managed several revitalization projects. He is also the former Director of Constituent Services for Councilman At-Large Allan Domb.

His goals as a state legislator include improving public education and job training, reducing unemployment, and promoting small business development and economic empowerment throughout the district. Burgos also is a strong advocate for criminal justice reform. He is working towards reducing recidivism and providing a pathway for ex-offenders who have learned from their mistakes and want to contribute to society.

Burgos, who has been featured in Al Día, Tainted Justice and El Sol newspaper, served on the board of the Eastern Pennsylvania Organizing Project, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the White Dog Community Foundation, Proyectos Sin Fronteras and Visitation Community Center. In addition, he has collaborated with Congreso de Latinos Unidos and The Latino Partnership on various projects and initiatives. He currently serves as Director of Latino Vote at the National Hispanic Caucus State Legislators.

As a father, Burgos’s children are his prime motivators and drive his passion to continue to improve and build a better, safer and stronger city of Philadelphia. He aims to give his constituents a light of hope, along with the tools they need to succeed. He wants to break the stereotypes associated with north Philadelphia by fostering mutual understanding between the 197th Legislative District and other districts throughout Pennsylvania.
