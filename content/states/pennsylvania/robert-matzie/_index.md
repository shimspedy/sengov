Rep. Robert F. "Rob" Matzie, D-Beaver/Allegheny, is a lifelong resident of Ambridge and a graduate of Ambridge Area High School. He received an associate degree in high technology communications from the Community College of Beaver County and a bachelor's degree in journalism and communications from Point Park University.

As a teen and through college, Matzie worked as an on-air personality and program director at WMBA Radio in Ambridge. He continues to cover high school sports, when his schedule permits, as a play-by-play announcer.

Prior to his election to the House in 2008, Matzie worked as a state Senate staff member for 14 years, served as mayor of Ambridge and was elected to the Democratic State Committee to represent Beaver County. In addition, Matzie was appointed as a member of the multi-municipal committee that developed a joint comprehensive plan known as SHALE, which includes the municipalities of South Heights, Harmony Township, Ambridge, Leetsdale and Economy.

Matzie was also appointed as a member of the Beaver County Bridge Committee, which oversees the rehabilitation and continued maintenance of all county bridges, and he currently serves on the Penn State Beaver Advisory Board.

Shortly after Matzie was sworn in, his bill to make COBRA health insurance coverage available to Pennsylvania businesses with fewer than 20 employees was chosen by House leaders as one of the first key pieces of legislation pushed in the 194th session. The bill passed, and Act 2 was signed into law on June 3, 2009.

Another proposal by Matzie was included in Act 14 of 2010. The Health Insurance Coverage Parity and Non-Discrimination Act brought Pennsylvania's insurance law in line with new federal requirements and gave the Pennsylvania Insurance Department authority to enforce those laws in the state's insurance market.

Eleven months into his first term, Matzie was notified that the fate of Old Economy Village in Ambridge was in jeopardy. He quickly recognized that the funding cuts would lead to changing the way Old Economy and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission would operate. Matzieâ€™s efforts, along with others, helped convince the Rendell Administration that the site should remain open and led PHMC and Friends of Old Economy to reach an agreement to operate the site.

In 2011, Matzie's commitment to the importance of our commonwealth's history and heritage led to his successful proposal to create the Subcommittee on Tourism Promotion, History and Heritage. In January 2011, Democratic Leader Frank Dermody appointed Matzie as one of two House members serving on the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, and Matzie continues to hold that appointment today.

Matzie was the Democratic champion of the successful effort to bring the Shell ethane cracker plant to Southwest Pennsylvania. The construction of the $6 billion plant, which is currently underway, is on schedule and is expected to be completed in 2021.
