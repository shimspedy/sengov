Ryan Aument is an American politician and a Republican member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 36th district. He was born on December 16, 1976. Prior to his election to the State Senate in 2014, he served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, for the 41st District, which includes portions of Lancaster County.

Raised in the ideals of his Pennsylvania home and tested on the field of combat defending his nation, Ryan Aument is committed to ensuring a prosperous and economically competitive Commonwealth for all. A lifelong resident of Lancaster County, Ryan received his bachelor’s degree in Education from The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.

He served as a U.S. Army captain in Operation Iraqi Freedom, briefly commanding an infantry company of 150 soldiers after the company commander was wounded in combat. Throughout his military service, he earned the Bronze Star Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Army Parachutist Badge.

His father operated a dairy farm for the first decade of Ryan’s life before taking work as a commercial truck driver, while his mother worked at a nearby retirement community. Like many other returning veterans, Ryan struggled to transition to civilian life.

Ryan spent three years as a production supervisor at ICI Paints in Reading, while also winning a seat on the Quarryville Borough Council. He later managed the state House campaign of a high school friend, Bryan Cutler. After Cutler won office, he hired Ryan as a key aide.

Ryan then won office as Lancaster County Clerk of Courts and went on to win two terms in the State House and later, two terms in the State Senate, where he served as chair of the Senate Education Committee and the Senate Communications and Technology Committee.

Along with representing the constituents of the 36th State Senatorial District, Ryan also formed and chaired the first ever Nuclear Energy Caucus in a state legislature in the nation and serves as Majority Whip for the Senate Republican Caucus. In that role, his duties include acting as assistant floor leader, working to gain support for legislation, and ensuring that Republican policies and strategies are maintained through the cooperative efforts of the majority caucus.

His mission is to ensure Pennsylvania competes with higher growth states such as Texas, North Carolina, and Florida for jobs and opportunities. To do that, Pennsylvania needs to boast family-sustaining jobs for residents, and to have family-sustaining jobs, the state must have strong employers.

A version of legislation sponsored by Ryan was included in the 2022-23 state budget. It cut the Corporate Net Income Tax rate from 9.99% to 8.99% and created a phased reduction to 4.99% by 2031. “Lowering our Corporate Net Income Tax will bring more high-quality jobs to our state, raise worker wages, elevate home values, and increase economic opportunity for Pennsylvanians in every class, sector, and corner of the Commonwealth,” he said.
