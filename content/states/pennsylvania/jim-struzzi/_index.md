James B. Struzzi II, born on September 23, 1967, is an American politician who has been serving as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 62nd district since December 1, 2018.

Born in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, Struzzi is the son of James Struzzi I and Anna Mae Struzzi. He had a brother, Michael, and a sister, Melissa. Struzzi graduated from Penn-Trafford High School in 1985, and attended the University of Pittsburgh where he earned a degree in English writing and communication. He also completed coursework for a master's degree in public administration at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

Struzzi is married to Christina, with whom he has four children, Aviana, Talan, Zarek, and Vaughn. They reside in Indiana, Pennsylvania.

Struzzi began his career working for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in 1999, as the community relations coordinator in District 10. He later became assistant press secretary for the Pittsburgh region of District 11. In 2013, Struzzi resigned from the PennDOT to succeed Dana Henry as the president of the Indiana County chamber of commerce.

In February 2018, Struzzi announced that he was seeking the Republican Party nomination to succeed Dave L. Reed as member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in District 62. He faced Democratic Party nominee Logan Dellafiora as well as write-in candidate Daniel Wilson in the general election. Struzzi sought reelection in 2020, and faced Democratic candidate Dennis Semsick and independent Laura Thomas in the general election.

Struzzi's committee assignments include Appropriations, Children & Youth, Human Services, and Insurance.
