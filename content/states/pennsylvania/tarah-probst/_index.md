Tarah Probst is a dedicated public servant who brings the same enthusiasm to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as she did as the first female mayor in over 200 years of Stroudsburg’s history. Born and raised in East Stroudsburg, she has lived in northeast Pennsylvania her entire life.

Her priorities include good jobs, fighting for fair funding for public schools and lower property taxes, making sure health care is affordable and accessible for everyone, protecting a woman’s right to choose, ensuring clean air and clean water, and being responsive to the residents of Monroe and Pike counties.

As Stroudsburg mayor, Probst worked with residents and businesses every day to address their concerns and solve their issues. She brought significant positive change and business growth to the borough. She also worked with other municipalities, Monroe County commissioners, and legislators in Harrisburg and Washington, D.C. to address regional issues. She was chosen as one of only 20 elected officials in the country for The Champions Institute/Smart Growth for improving lives by improving communities.

In addition to being Stroudsburg mayor, she most recently worked for a local addiction recovery center. She also previously owned a downtown Stroudsburg restaurant with her husband and spent many years in marketing, helping business owners grow and connect.

Probst is a former member of the Stroud Area Regional Police Commission; Stroudsburg Borough Streets Committee; I-80 Committee; Stroudsburg Borough Codes Committee; Brodhead Watershed Association; Hamilton, Stroud, and Pocono Townships and Stroudsburg Borough Regional Plan Task Force; Pocono Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Control Board; Downtown Stroudsburg Business Association; Carbon-Monroe-Pike Drug & Alcohol Commission; Stroudsburg Borough Public Relations Committee; Stroudsburg Quaker Alley Community Park Project; and Stroudsburg Concerts in the Park.

She graduated from King’s College and Widener University School of Law. She and her husband, Don, have 5 children. She is currently serving the 189th Legislative District.
