Scott E. Hutchinson, born on August 19, 1961, is an American politician from Pennsylvania. He is currently serving as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 21st district, a position he has held since 2013.

Hutchinson was born in Oil City, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Oil City Area High School and went on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics from the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania in 1983. He has also taken additional courses at the University of Pittsburgh at Titusville and Thiel College in Greenville.

Before his political career, Hutchinson served as the Chief Deputy County Treasurer for Venango County from 1984 to 1992. He was also a member of the Oil City Area School Board from 1985 to 1992, during which time he served as its vice president and chairman of its budget and finance committee. In 1986, he was appointed by Governor Dick Thornburgh to the Venango County Board of Assistance, serving until 1992.

Hutchinson began his political career as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 64th district, a position he held from 1993 to 2012. During his tenure, he was the Republican chairman of the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee and a member of the House Veterans Affairs and Emergency Preparedness Committee.

In 2013, Hutchinson was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate to represent the 21st district in an uncontested election. He succeeded Republican Mary Jo White, who retired at the end of her term in 2012. As a senator, Hutchinson serves as Chairman of the Finance Committee and Vice Chairman of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee. He is also a member of the Senate Game and Fisheries, Health and Human Services, and Local Government committees, and serves as the Chairman of the Local Government Commission.

Hutchinson is committed to improving Pennsylvaniaâ€™s business climate by supporting efforts to lift the burdens placed on employers, particularly small companies, and by creating an environment that encourages economic development and job creation. He was the prime sponsor of Act 52 of 2016, which established the Pennsylvania Grade Crude Development Advisory Council. The council is charged with promoting the long-term viability of the conventional oil and gas industry, which has been an integral part of the regional economy in Northwest Pennsylvania for over a century and a half.

In his personal life, Hutchinson married Mary Beth Radkowski in 1993. They have three children, Sophie, Anne Marie, and Lucy, and live in Oil City.
