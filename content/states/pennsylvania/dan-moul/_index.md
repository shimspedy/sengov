Daniel P. Moul, born on October 10, 1950, in Hanover, Pennsylvania, is an American politician and businessman. He is currently serving as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 91st District since 2007.

Moul graduated from New Oxford High School in 1977 and studied finance at York College of Pennsylvania. Prior to his run for political office, Moul worked in sales at Utz Brands. After that, Moul operated his own real estate development business.

Moul was first elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2006 and has been re-elected to eight more consecutive terms. In 2020, Moul was among twenty-six Pennsylvania House Republicans who called for the reversal of Joe Biden's certification as the winner of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 United States presidential election, citing false claims of election irregularities.

Moul, who grew up on a farm in rural Adams County, is in his second term as chairman of the House Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, a committee on which he previously served for several years. He also serves on the House Tourism and Recreational Development Committee. These committees address important legislation aimed at enhancing Pennsylvania’s leading industries – agriculture and tourism.

As state representative of the district that includes the Gettysburg battlefields and related tourist attractions, Moul has served on the House Tourism and Recreational Development Committee since taking office. In this role, he is responsible for laws to enhance funding for tourism promotion and legislation to protect landowners who permit free, public use of their land for recreational purposes.

Moul previously chaired the House Local Government Committee, and served as vice chairman of the House Children and Youth Committee, where he was instrumental in strengthening state laws to protect children from sexual predators and other forms of child abuse. In 2008, he championed a law to permit the extradition of deadbeat parents who leave Pennsylvania to avoid paying child support. Moul’s bill also increased the penalties for willful non-payment of court-ordered support. In 2017, the Pennsylvania Partnerships for Children honored Moul with its Champion for Children award in recognition of his support for child protection.

Moul lives in Conewago Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania, with his wife Lori. They have two children and five grandchildren.
