Barbara Gleim, born on May 20, 1964, in Lanham, Maryland, is an American politician. A Republican, she is a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 199th District.

Gleim graduated from Glenelg High School in 1982. In 1985, she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Maryland. She furthered her education by earning a Master's in Business Administration degree in food and agribusiness from Delaware Valley University in 2009.

Before her political career, Gleim spent most of her adult life living, working, and serving in the community of Carlisle. She served as the director of operations and then director of business development at John W. Gleim Jr. Inc. Excavating. Her private sector work experience also included serving as a project manager for Ahold Delhaize (the parent company of Giant Foods) and Daymon Worldwide, where she led several marketing and sales initiatives.

In addition to her professional career, Gleim has been an active leader in her community with a focus on education. She served for eight years on the Cumberland Valley School Board, two of which she served as president of the board.

Gleim was elected to represent the 199th District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2018. She won re-election in 2020 and 2022. In 2020, Gleim was among 26 Pennsylvania House Republicans who called for the reversal of Joe Biden's certification as the winner of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 United States presidential election, citing false claims of election irregularities.

Gleim lives in Middlesex Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, with her husband, Tracey. They have three adult children.
