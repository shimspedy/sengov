Robert L. Freeman, a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, was born in Easton, Pennsylvania on March 9, 1956. He is the son of Joyce Styers Freeman and the late Jacob B. Freeman. After graduating from Easton Area High School in 1975, he pursued higher education at Moravian College. There, he received his bachelor’s degree in history and political science, graduating magna cum laude in 1978. His academic journey continued at Lehigh University, where he earned his Masters degree in history in 1984.

Freeman's political career began with his election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1982. He served six two-year terms before leaving due to an unsuccessful bid for the State Senate in 1994. Between 1995 and 1997, he served as executive director of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee and as Democratic executive director of the Senate Local Government Committee from 1997 to 1998.

In 1998, Freeman returned to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and has been re-elected ever since. He is a former shop steward and member of the UFCW union. His contributions to society have been recognized with the Elton Stone Award and the Moravian College History Prize. He also authored the article “Light Rail and the Lehigh Valley,” which appeared in the New Valley Press in 1981.

During his previous 12 years in the House, Freeman served as chairman of the House Select Committee on Land Use and Growth Management (1991-92), which recommended ways to improve growth management and reduce sprawl. He was one of the leaders in revising the Municipalities Planning Code in 2000 and authored the Elm Street Program designed to revitalize older residential neighborhoods. The Elm Street legislation was signed into law in February 2004.

Freeman is the chairman of the House Local Government Committee. He has served on the committees of Labor Relations, Local Government, Environmental Resources and Energy, and State Government. Freeman, who resides in Easton, is married to Terri Arshan Freeman and has two stepchildren.
