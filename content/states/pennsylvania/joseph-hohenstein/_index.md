Joseph C. Hohenstein, often known as Joe Hohenstein, is a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He has been representing the 177th district since 2019. Born on June 24, 1967, Hohenstein was raised in Philadelphia in a union household. His mother was a shop steward with AFSCME DC 47 and his father was a member of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers.

Hohenstein's educational journey began at Earlham College where he earned a degree in International Studies in 1989. He then attended law school at the University of Minnesota, receiving his J.D. in 1993 and passing the bar the same year.

Before being elected as a state representative, Hohenstein had a diverse professional career. He worked as an immigration attorney, served in nonprofit organizations, and ran his own private practice. He also made significant contributions to the field of education as a faculty member at Temple University Beasley School of Law. There, he developed the school's first immigration law clinic, guiding students and colleagues in this particular area of U.S. law. His work in this field has earned him several awards and recognitions.

For over 15 years, Hohenstein served on the board of Frankford Friends School. As the Chair of that Board, he led a three-phase expansion project that included constructing a new building and outdoor learning area, and repurposing an abandoned neighboring church for the school’s gym and music programs.

Hohenstein is currently on the board of directors for Philadelphia's Animal Care and Control Team (ACCT Philly), the region’s largest animal care and control service provider. ACCT Philly offers adoption, foster and volunteer programs as well as owner surrender prevention resources. Located in North Philadelphia, it takes in nearly 18,000 animals annually.

In the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Hohenstein's top priorities include full fair funding for Philadelphia schools, solutions to the drug crisis that make everyone in the community safer, and tax structures that are fair to working families and make corporations pay their fair share. He supports women’s rights and pay equality, a clean environment, sensible laws to curb gun violence, protecting workers and raising the minimum wage, and fair districts to provide everyone an equal voice in government. He currently serves as the Secretary of the Pa. House Philadelphia Delegation.

Hohenstein lives just blocks away from his childhood home with his wife Brandi. They have two children, Emma and Mars.
