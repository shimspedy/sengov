JoAnne Stehr is an American politician serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 107th district. She was elected to her first term in November 2022 and assumed office on January 3, 2023. Notably, she is the first woman representative from Schuylkill County and in the 107th District.

Stehr's political priorities include restoring the economy, energizing small businesses, tax reform, agriculture, veterans, health, seniors, legislative term limits, and protecting children, gun rights, freedom, and preserving core American conservative values. For the 2023-24 Legislative Session, she was appointed to serve on the Aging and Older Adult Services, Health, and Liquor Control House committees.

Born and raised in the beautiful Mahantongo Valley, Stehr grew up on a family farm where she was instilled with values such as hard work, thrift, perseverance, faith, integrity, and caring for her neighbors. She is a lifelong resident of Schuylkill County and graduated from Tri-Valley High School.

After high school, Stehr worked full-time while attending night school at the Schuylkill Area Vocational Technical School. There, she became a licensed practicing nurse. She has spent 30 years as a home health care and hospice nurse and has worked as a client relationship executive for Home Health Services.

Stehr is deeply committed to her community through volunteer work and organization involvement. She frequently volunteers at her local food pantry and serves as chair of the Hegins Zoning and Planning Committee. She is the proud mother of two sons, Eli and Beau.

Stehr is looking forward to working for the constituents of the 107th District in Northumberland and Schuylkill counties.
