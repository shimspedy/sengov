Justin Fleming is a dedicated public servant who was elected in November 2022 to represent the 105th Legislative District in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. He has spent nearly all his life in Dauphin County, attending Susquehanna Township High School, participating in local religious services, and supporting local businesses.

Born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Justin grew up in poverty, relying on public housing, free and reduced lunches, and food stamps. His family used these public benefits as a bridge to the middle class. The quality public education he received, coupled with the availability of subsidized student loans, allowed him to attend and graduate from Millersville University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in speech communication.

Justin has spent nearly 18 years in and around state government as a public servant and as an advocate to expand mental health care and provide more resources for children in Pennsylvania. Before becoming a state Representative, Justin served as the Susquehanna Township Commissioner for the 8th Ward.

As a state Representative, Justin is committed to working with other legislators to provide better education for all children. He is a strong supporter of social and economic justice and is dedicated to supporting working families by reducing income inequality and providing access to health care to make life-saving medications more affordable.

Justin lives with his wife and two children in Susquehanna Township. He continues to serve his community and the state of Pennsylvania with dedication and passion.
