Jack Rader Jr. is a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing Monroe County’s 176th Legislative District. He was first elected in 2014 and is now serving in his fifth term. During the 2023-24 Legislative Session, Jack has been appointed to serve on the House Finance, Insurance, Local Government, and Tourism and Economic and Recreational Development committees. He was also named Republican chair of the Subcommittee on Boroughs under the Local Government Committee and Republican chair of the Subcommittee on Arts and Entertainment under the Tourism and Economic and Recreational Development Committee.

Jack’s legislative priorities include job creation and economic growth, in addition to addressing the school property tax issue. During his House tenure, Jack has been the prime sponsor of five bills that have become law. These include Act 101 of 2018, which grants municipalities an exemption from establishing a leaf waste collection program provided they meet a population density threshold, and Act 57 of 2019, which allows the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board to transfer up to 75 restaurant liquor licenses that it holds from counties with a surplus of them to counties where they are needed for tourism development projects.

Prior to his election, Jack served 28 years on the Jackson Township board of supervisors in Monroe County, including 20 years as chairman. In addition, he served as Pocono-Jackson Water Authority chairman, Monroe County Council of Government vice president, Hamilton/Jackson/Pocono Park and Open Space Commission chairman, and Chestnuthill/Jackson/Eldred/Ross/Polk Regional Planning Board vice chairman. Jack is also a past president of the Monroe County Township Officials’ Board.

Jack’s business background includes more than three decades as manager and vice president of Mountain Springs Resort, located in Reeders. The company has been owned by his family for more than a half-century. Jack is a graduate of Pocono Mountain High School and earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Susquehanna University. Jack lives in Reeders with his wife, Susan. They are proud parents of four children and six grandchildren.
