Carol Hill-Evans is a State Representative who was elected to the state legislature on November 8, 2016, to represent the 95th Legislative District in York County. She is a native of York City and was educated in the York City School District prior to earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Business from Penn State York.

Before her political career, Representative Hill-Evans worked in human resources and retired after 27 years from Caterpillar Inc. Her political experience includes 9 years of serving on York City Council as both vice president and president. This experience with policy, legislation, and collaboration has helped Carol form important relationships and gives her the ability to work with all parties to help solve the issues facing the 95th district.

Some of the issues she focuses on include equitable education funding, improving economic development, addressing homelessness, and identifying and providing resources for veterans and first-line defenders. Currently, Representative Hill-Evans serves on the Veterans Affairs and Emergency Preparedness (Chair, Security & Emergency Response Readiness subcommittee), Education (Secretary), Local Government, and Tourism & Recreational Development Committees.

In addition, Rep. Hill-Evans is Chair of the Central Pennsylvania Delegation, which serves Harrisburg, Lancaster, York, Reading, and State College. She is also a member of the Early Education, Women’s Health, and LGBTQ+ Equality Caucuses, and the co-chair for the Bi-Partisan Women’s Caucus. Rep. Hill-Evans is a lifetime member of both the American Legion Post 127 Auxiliary and VFW Post 556 Auxiliary.

As a lifelong resident of the City of York and lifelong member of Small Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church, Carol Hill-Evans understands the complexities and challenges of urban living and draws on that knowledge to help all residents of her district, which includes West York Borough, North York Borough, Spring Garden Township, and the City of York.

Representative Hill-Evans is the widow of William C. Evans, mother of two daughters, and grandmother of four. She believes that “All things are possible with God,” and she continues to enjoy meeting constituents and serving her community.
