Jason Dawkins is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving the 179th Legislative District. This district stretches throughout lower northeast Philadelphia and comprises the neighborhoods of Frankford, Wissinoming, Mayfair, Olney, and Oxford Circle.

Before his election in 2014, Jason spent seven years working as a legislative aide for Philadelphia City Councilwoman Maria D. Quiñones-Sánchez. In this role, he was responsible for recreation-based development and community engagement. He served as a recreation liaison and special projects director, spearheading many initiatives surrounding parks, recreation centers, libraries, and zoning regulations. His efforts led to the direction of more than $4 million in capital funding towards redeveloping recreational facilities in previously underserved neighborhoods.

In the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Jason serves as Majority Chairman of the Labor and Industry Committee. He also serves on the House Democratic Policy Committee and is a member of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus and Philadelphia House Delegation. He served as chairman of the Philadelphia House Delegation from 2019 to 2022.

During his time representing the 179th, Jason has championed several key pieces of legislation, amendments, and policy initiatives. These include a first-of-its-kind legislation that seeks to create major reform in Pennsylvania’s criminal justice system, allowing all Pennsylvanians currently serving sentences of life imprisonment to go before a parole board and petition their cases. He also introduced legislation that would help to hold local businesses accountable to their customers. Thanks to Jason’s efforts, recovery houses for those suffering from substance abuse addictions are required to prove compliance under the Americans with Disabilities Act prior to receiving state licensure.

Jason has also advocated for his community by working to increase regulation and enforcement mechanisms of corner stores, often referred to as 'Stop and Gos.' This legislation, now law, has given local and state authorities the ability to ensure that these establishments meet all public health requirements necessary for receiving a liquor license. He also introduced legislation to honor fallen law enforcement Officer Gary Frank Skerski by naming a bridge over Castor Avenue in Philadelphia in his honor.

As a state representative, Jason has fought to serve as a voice for all Pennsylvanians. In Harrisburg, he advocates for issues that will work to alleviate poverty and propel individuals and families toward a brighter future. Jason is working to ensure Pennsylvania is moving forward, not falling behind, by helping incentivize young graduates of local research universities and colleges to remain in-state, and by promoting workforce development and further education opportunities for all. He believes the government should be a tool of the people and should be transparent and accessible to all.
