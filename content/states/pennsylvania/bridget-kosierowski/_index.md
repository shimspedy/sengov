Bridget M. Kosierowski is a State Representative who was elected to serve the people of the 114th Legislative District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives following a special election in March 2019. She made history by becoming the first woman to represent Lackawanna County in the General Assembly in more than 50 years.

Kosierowski has spent her professional life in the health care sector working as a registered nurse. For more than 25 years, she helped patients live long and healthy lives, while also witnessing families struggle to afford quality health care. As a mother who has raised a survivor of a devastating leukemia diagnosis, she knows firsthand the hardship that too many families face. Through these experiences, she understands the impact compassionate leadership can have.

As a state representative, Kosierowski's legislative priorities include preserving and enhancing health care services for all. She will work to preserve the state's Children Health Insurance Program, expand Medicaid access and protect those with pre-existing conditions from higher insurance premiums. She also plans to take steps to address the burden of school property taxes, as well as support efforts to impose a tax on natural-gas extractions and to close legal loopholes that allow multi-state corporations to pay lower income taxes.

Kosierowski is committed to focusing on the needs of her constituents through assistance provided by her office and through community outreach. She will work with members of both parties to find common ground that benefits the local area and communities across Pennsylvania.

Kosierowski is honored to serve the residents in the 114th District. She is guided by a deep desire to improve the lives of every man and woman to make communities a better place to live, to work and to raise a family.

Kosierowski is a lifelong Pennsylvanian, and graduate of Scranton Preparatory School and Villanova University. She resides with her husband Joe and their four children in Waverly Township, raising her family in the same neighborhood where she and her 5 siblings were raised.
