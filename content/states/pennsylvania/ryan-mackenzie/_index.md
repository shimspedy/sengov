Ryan E. Mackenzie is a politician from Pennsylvania and a member of the Republican Party. He represents the 187th Legislative District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. His mother is Milou Mackenzie, who is also a Lehigh Valley-area Republican state representative in the 131st district. They are the first mother-son pair to simultaneously serve in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

Mackenzie has represented District 187 in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since first winning election in 2012. During the 2023 to 2024 legislative session, Mackenzie is serving as the Republican chair of the Labor and Industry Committee. Mackenzie has previously served as majority chair of the House Government Oversight Committee, deputy majority whip, deputy chair of the House Majority Policy Committee, vice chair of the House Labor and Industry Committee, chair of the Financial Services and Banking Subcommittee with the House Commerce Committee, and chair of the Workforce Development Subcommittee with the Economic Recovery Task Force.

In 2017, Mackenzie announced he would run for the United States House of Representatives in Pennsylvania's 15th congressional district in 2018. He withdrew from the race in March 2018 when the state Supreme Court created new district lines. In July 2023, Mackenzie announced his candidacy for Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district in the 2024 election.

Mackenzie is a ninth-generation resident of Pennsylvania, where his family has lived since colonial times. He graduated from Parkland High School, received his undergraduate degree in Finance and International Business from New York University, and earned his Master in Business Administration from Harvard Business School. Ryan has continued his education by completing programs at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, the University of Pennsylvania’s Fels Institute of Government, and the U.S. Army War College.
