Kristine Howard is a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 167th legislative district. She was first elected on November 6, 2018. Born on June 7, 1961, in Haddon Heights, New Jersey, she currently resides in Malvern, Pennsylvania.

Kristine is a forward thinker who is in tune with the needs of her neighbors. As a devoted single mother of seven, three of whom are still attending public schools, she focuses on the principle to put children first and works constantly to ensure their safety. Sheâ€™s dedicated to creating solutions to the problems faced by Chester County families.

Kristine thanks both her father, a probation officer, and mother, an administrator at Penn Medical School, for inspiring her to pursue a life of civic duty. She has degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and Rutgers Law School.

Before her political career, she worked in New Mexico running a legal and social services organization. After moving back to Pennsylvania, she advocated for youth in foster care as a part of the Philadelphia Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts. She also investigated child abuse in Chester County when she worked at the Chester County Department of Children, Youth, and Family Services.

Her political career began when she assumed office on January 1, 2019, succeeding Duane Milne. She has since been serving the 167th Legislative District, which includes parts of Charlestown, East Whiteland, Easttown, West Pikeland, West Whiteland, Willistown Township, and Malvern Borough.
