Jamie Barton is currently serving his first term in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. His focus is on stimulating the economy, igniting small businesses, reducing the cost of energy for families and businesses, improving state infrastructure, investing in school students, ensuring election integrity across the Commonwealth, and supporting community safety through law enforcement.

Barton has been appointed to serve on three House committees during the 2023-24 Legislative Session: Housing and Community Development, State Government, Tourism and Economic and Recreational Development.

A resident of East Brunswick Township, Barton has spent the past 33 years of his career in the energy industry as the vice president of Jack Rich, Inc. He studied business at Penn State and later Alvernia University, where he graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration and was awarded the Community Service Award.

Barton is extremely active in his community. He serves as a lay pastor and Sunday school teacher and has served as president and consistory member at his church, St. Johns UCC in Orwigsburg. Additionally, he serves on the board of directors for the Big Impact Group of Schuylkill County and Schuylkill County Chamber of Commerce, and volunteers as an instructor at the Young Entrepreneur Academy. He also is a past president and current member of the board of directors for the Orwigsburg Lions Club and volunteer fundraiser for the Pennsylvania State Police Camp Cadet.

Barton serves on the Pennsylvania Petroleum Association board of directors and as an adjunct professor at Penn State. He is a member of the Anthracite Region Independent Power Producers Association and the Berks/Schuylkill Oil Dealers Association. Jamie served on CITGO Petroleum’s Marketer Council from 2016-19. In 2017, the Orwigsburg Lions Club awarded him with the Citizen of the Year Award. In 2021, the Schuylkill Chamber of Commerce awarded Jamie with Businessman of the Year Award, as a proud small business owner himself.

Barton is happily engaged to his fiancé, Brenda, and they have four children together: Jack, Alee, Nick and Joe. They also have two Bernese Mountain dogs, Baloo and Lola. He is looking forward to getting to work for the constituents of the 124th District in Berks and Schuylkill counties.
