Sen. Wayne Langerholc, Jr. was first elected to the Pennsylvania Senate in November 2016. Prior to serving in the Senate, Langerholc served as an Assistant District Attorney in Cambria County, an attorney in private practice and as a Richland Township Supervisor where he worked to make the township more business friendly to encourage development in our community.
As chairman of the Transportation Committee, Langerholc led the bipartisan compromise to stop PennDOT’s bridge tolling initiative with his Senate Bill 382 signed into law as Act 84 of 2022, which protected small businesses and communities. He has sought out new initiatives to attract and grow businesses throughout the commonwealth. He successfully advocated for additional investments in the budget for PennDOT’s design and construction programs as well as the establishment of Airport Land Development Zones. Langerholc has been the leader in bringing the emerging technology of Automated Vehicles and e-scooters to the forefront with Act 24 of 2021 and Act 130 of 2022, respectively. He also serves as a member of the Appropriations, Judiciary, and Veteran Affairs and Emergency Preparedness committees.
Langerholc is a graduate of Richland High School, Juniata College and Widener University Commonwealth Law School. He lives in Richland Township with his wife, Cortney, and their three daughters.
