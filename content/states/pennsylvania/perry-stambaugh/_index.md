Perry A. Stambaugh, born on March 8, 1960, is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing District 86. He first took office following the 2020 Pennsylvania House of Representatives election.

Stambaugh was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, U.S. He graduated from Penn State University and operates a family farm in Green Park in Perry County, Pennsylvania. He is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association of America.

Stambaugh supports measures to improve the deployment of high-speed Internet to rural areas, as well as state constitutional reforms, such as electing state appellate judges on a district (not statewide) basis and eliminating property taxes to fund schools. He also backs state legislative and congressional term limits.

Before running for the state House, Stambaugh spent most of his nearly 40-year professional career as a rural and agricultural magazine editor on local, statewide, and national levelsâ€”notably with the former Pennsylvania Farmer magazine (now American Agriculturist); Penn Lines magazine, published by the Pennsylvania Rural Electric Association; and RE Magazine, produced by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.

Stambaugh currently sits on the Commerce (as Republican secretary), Environmental Resources & Energy, Transportation, and Labor & Industry committees, including the Labor & Industry Employment and Unemployment Compensation Subcommittee.

Stambaugh ran for re-election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to represent District 86 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.
