Ismail "Izzy" Smith-Wade-El is an American politician serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 49th district. He was elected in November 2022 and assumed office on December 1, 2022.

Izzy was born and raised in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in theatre and anthropology from Carnegie Mellon University in 2014. His values are drawn from his family, his Catholic faith, and his community.

Prior to his election to the PA Legislature, Izzy was the President of Lancaster City Council on which he had served since 2017. During his four years on Council, Izzy helped secure the largest investments in affordable housing and lead removal for the City of Lancaster.

In addition to his council duties, Izzy also worked as a program specialist at the Lancaster County Homeless Coalition. He served as a member of the Lancaster City Council from 2017 until his resignation in 2022 following his election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

In his short time in the House, Izzy has organized with other legislators to turn his community’s shared values into reality, such as passing the Fairness Act out of the PA House. He fights for racial justice, workers’ rights and a fully-funded education for every student in the Commonwealth.
