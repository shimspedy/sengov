Kate Klunk is a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 169th House district in York County, Pennsylvania. She was born on June 4, 1982, and is affiliated with the Republican party. She resides in Hanover and is an attorney by profession.

Klunk was elected to serve as a representative on November 4, 2014. Since then, she has established herself as a conservative voice that represents the people of the district in Harrisburg. Her mission as a lawmaker is to ensure state government is efficient, fiscally responsible, and places taxpayers first.

She is serving as the Republican Chair of the House Ethics Committee and is a member of the House Judiciary, Rules and Professional Licensure committees as well. She is an advocate for policies that restore fiscal discipline in state government; revitalize Pennsylvania’s business climate to create good, family-sustaining jobs; provide immediate and permanent property tax relief; fight against unnecessary tax increases on families, seniors, and businesses; improve the quality of our children’s educational opportunities; preserve the Commonwealth’s rich agricultural heritage; and protect the rights of private property owners.

Prior to her election to the state House, Kate gained experience through her work in many facets of government and the private sector. She worked in the White House under President George W. Bush as a member of his National Economic Council team, where she researched and prepared national economic policy briefings for senior staff. Kate continued her tenure at the White House as a member of President Bush’s communications team.

Upon graduation from Hanover Senior High School as Class of 2000 valedictorian, Kate continued her education on an academic scholarship at Dickinson College. She worked multiple jobs to help pay her way through school including packing potato chips at Utz Quality Foods, LLC. Kate graduated cum laude with degrees in economics, history, and public policy studies. She went on to earn her juris doctor from The Dickinson School of Law of the Pennsylvania State University.

As a private practice attorney, Kate has counseled small businesses, individuals, educational institutions and corporations in employment matters where she saw firsthand how government policies and regulations impact taxpayers. Kate is a 2013 graduate of the Anne B. Anstine Excellence in Public Service Series, a program that aims to increase the number and influence of Republican women in government, politics, and community leadership. She is also a member of the National Rifle Association and the Federalist Society.
