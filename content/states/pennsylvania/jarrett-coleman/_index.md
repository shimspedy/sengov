Jarrett Charles Coleman, born around 1990, is an American politician and pilot. He is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania State Senate, representing the 16th District. He assumed office on January 3, 2023, succeeding Pat Browne.

Coleman was born and raised in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania. He and his wife, Katie, live in Breinigsville with their two children and three dogs. His job as an airline pilot has taken him to different locations, but he eventually returned to the Lehigh Valley/Upper Bucks County region because it was the best place to raise his growing family.

He studied to become a pilot at Lehigh Carbon Community College in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, and later at Embryâ€“Riddle Aeronautical University in Cincinnati. There, he earned a Bachelor of Science in aviation and a Master of Business Administration.

Before his political career, Coleman worked as a pilot for CommuteAir, Compass Airlines, and JetBlue. He was elected to the school board for the Parkland School District in November 2021, running on his opposition to the district's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote learning and mask requirements for children, and the teaching of critical race theory.

In the 2022 Republican primary for Pennsylvania's 16th Senate District, Coleman successfully challenged 17-year incumbent Pat Browne, narrowly defeating Browne by only 24 votes. He went on to win the general election, defeating Democrat Mark Pinsley.

Currently, Senator Jarrett Coleman chairs the Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee, the panel responsible for reviewing proposals to restructure and streamline state government. Coleman is also a member of the Communications and Technology, Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure, Education, Local Government, and Urban Affairs and Housing committees.
