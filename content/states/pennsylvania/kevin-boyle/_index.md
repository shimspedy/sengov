Kevin J. Boyle was born on February 7, 1980, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is an American politician serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and current minority Chairman of the PA House State Government Committee. He represents Pennsylvania House District 172, which covers parts of Northeast Philadelphia.

Boyle grew up in a row home in the Olney section of Philadelphia, where he was raised by his pro-union working-class parents. His father, Francis Boyle, was an Irish immigrant who came to America at age 19. His mother, Eileen Boyle, was a first-generation Irish American who worked as a school crossing guard.

He graduated with honors from Cardinal Dougherty High School in 1998 and LaSalle University in 2002, where he received his B.A. in Political Science. He furthered his education at Harvard University, where he earned a master's degree in Education. While at Harvard, Boyle researched urban education issues, school funding streams, and strategies to expand access to higher education.

Before his political career, Boyle worked as an advocate for the Alliance for Strong Families and Communities, the nation's second-largest association for family service organizations in Washington, D.C. His responsibilities included policy analysis, meeting members of Congress regarding legislation, and organizing member agencies into action on their issues.

Boyle began his involvement in Philadelphia politics by serving as campaign manager for his older brother Brendan's campaigns for the state legislature. In 2007, Kevin became Legislative Director to City Councilman Bill Greenlee, a role Boyle held until 2010 when he stepped down from the job to run his own race for State Representative.

Boyle was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2010 when he ran against 32-year incumbent and former Speaker of the Pennsylvania House John Perzel. He and his brother Brendan are the only set of brothers to serve simultaneously in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives in its 300-year history.

His legislative interests include education, equality, and economic development. He is active in local civic organizations in Northeast Philadelphia.
