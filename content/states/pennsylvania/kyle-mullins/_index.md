Kyle Mullins is an American politician and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 112th district. He was elected to this position in 2018 to serve the residents of the 112th Legislative District in Lackawanna County.

Born and raised in Peckville, Mullins is a 2003 graduate of Valley View High School and a 2007 graduate of West Chester University, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in political science. He had the honor of serving as student body president of both his high school and college classes.

Before his election, Mullins dedicated his professional life to public service through a variety of roles with the Pennsylvania Senate. Most recently, he served as legislative director in the office of state Sen. John Blake, where he diligently worked to serve constituents, advance policy, and advocate for resources on behalf of residents in Lackawanna, Luzerne, and Monroe counties.

As a state representative, Mullins’ legislative priorities are rooted in three critical issue areas: strengthening communities, protecting hard-working families, and reforming state government. He believes that creating a climate for good jobs and opportunities means strong communities. These opportunities must be available at family-sustaining wages so that young people can stay and build families of their own in Northeast Pennsylvania.

Mullins also believes it is crucial that the House and Senate work together to find real property tax solutions for homeowners and especially for seniors – solutions that must be accomplished while increasing our commitment to educating school children. He believes that children should feel safe and cared for at home and at school, and that women must feel respected and empowered at work.

He also believes that citizens deserve to breathe clean air and drink safe water, and they deserve to know that their leaders are standing up for both. He understands that we must strengthen programs that benefit older Pennsylvanians and that we must stand up for the veterans who protected our shores and fought for our freedom – that, without hesitation, it is our responsibility to support and serve the people who have supported and served us.

At the center of Mullins' decision to run for public office was a guiding principle that government should be in the business of enriching and supporting its citizens – not its politicians. It is time to enact real reforms that put our communities’ best interests first and do away with government abuse.

It is the honor of Mullins' professional life that the men and women of the 112th District have placed their trust in him to act on their behalf and deliver results. That is exactly where his heart and his decision making reside today and will remain.

Kyle is married to Lauren Cobb. Together, they reside in their hometown of Peckville where they are raising their son, Conor, daughter, Caroline, and a chocolate lab, Jagger.
