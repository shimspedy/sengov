Currently, Schwank serves as the Minority Chair of the Senate Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee. Her role allows her to influence policies that directly impact Pennsylvania's agricultural sector and rural communities.

Schwank's commitment to public service is further demonstrated by her membership on several boards. These include the Farm Show Commission, the Commission for Agriculture Education Excellence, the Center for Rural Pennsylvania, the United Way of PA, and the PA State System of Higher Education. Each of these roles allows her to make a positive impact on different aspects of life in Pennsylvania.

Since 2021, Schwank has served as the Caucus Administrator in the Senate. This role, which involves coordinating the legislative agenda for her party, allows her to have a direct impact on the laws and policies enacted in the state.

Throughout her career, Judith L. Schwank has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to serving her community. Her work in various roles, from horticulture agent to state senator, reflects her dedication to improving the lives of Pennsylvanians.
