Marci Mustello is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. She represents the 11th district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

Born on July 25, 1970, in Butler, Pennsylvania, Marci is a life-long resident of western Pennsylvania and was raised on the traditions of hard work and self-reliance. She is a graduate of Butler High School and attended Butler County Community College, Slippery Rock University, and Grove City College.

Before her political career, Marci worked as a staffer for U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly. She also served as the president of the board of directors for the Butler County Humane Society, where she was responsible for overseeing the administration, programs, day-to-day operations, and strategic plan of the organization.

Marci began her political journey when she ran in a special election to represent District 11 in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2019, after former representative Brian Ellis resigned. She won the election and assumed office on June 4, 2019. In 2020, she defeated Ryan Covert in the Republican primary, and Sam Doctor in the general election.

Currently serving her second full term in the House of Representatives, Marci has been assigned to serve on the House Appropriations (chair of the subcommittee on education), Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Gaming Oversight, and Liquor Control committees for the 2023-24 Legislative Session.

Marci is committed to improving the quality of life for all residents and making sure our children have the best education available. As part of her legislative priorities, she will protect our state and national Constitutions and will advocate for stateâ€™s rights, Second Amendment rights, and pro-life rights. She will also strive to enact policies and work with local government and law enforcement to end the opioid crisis, raise awareness of animal cruelty, and end the influence of special interests.

Marci Mustello represents the 11th Legislative District in Butler County, which includes the city of Butler; Butler, Oakland, Summit, Jefferson, Clinton, Donegal, Clearfield, Winfield boroughs and Buffalo townships; as well as East Butler and Saxonburg and Chicora boroughs.
