He has supported legislation to promote family-sustaining jobs, improve infrastructure, and give children a quality education.

Eric has also passed legislation, Act 7 of 2022, that designates a portion of Pennsylvania State Route 31 in South Huntingdon Township, Westmoreland County, as the John Michael Beyrand Memorial Highway. Mr. Beyrand was killed in action in Vietnam on August 9, 1969.

For the 2023-24 legislative session, Eric serves in the Game and Fisheries, State Government, and Transportation committees.

He was also selected to serve Deputy Whip to assist Republican Whip Tim Oâ€™Neal in tracking House votes and informing House colleagues of upcoming issues and legislation.

Eric is committed to supporting veterans, defending pro-life values, supporting law enforcement, and fighting for our Second Amendment rights. He also supports kids in youth sports and recognizes how important these sports are in his district. He attends local business tours to gain knowledge of his surrounding areas and hosts district events to help meet the needs of his constituents. Eric also serves on the Westmoreland County Broadband Task Force.

Prior to taking office, Eric was a carpenter superintendent for the Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters and is still an active member today. In this role, he managed projects safely and punctually while controlling costs and containing budgets. With this experience, he is devoted to protecting taxpayer dollars.

Eric resides in Smithton with his wife, Rachelle; their two daughters, Brianna and Brielle; and their two dogs, Jasmine and Winston. In his free time, Eric enjoys spending time with his family, spending time outdoors, and target shooting.
