Joe Webster is a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 150th District. He was elected to the state legislature for the 150th Legislative District in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Born Joseph Gerald Webster in Norristown, Pennsylvania, he was part of the first generation in his large Philadelphia family to attend college. Joe was appointed to the Air Force Academy. During his tenure at the Air Force Academy, he served as an Assistant Professor teaching Speech Communications, Executive Writing and Western Civilizations/Values.

Webster graduated from La Salle College High School in 1976. He then graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1980 with a degree in Engineering and Humanities. Webster would later receive Master of Arts degrees from Wright State in English in 1984 and Naval War College in National Security Policy Studies in 2001 and a PhD from George Washington University in Public Policy in 2004.

He went on to serve as an officer in the United States Air Force for 31 years, including 20 years at the Pentagon working on special projects and eventually serving as the legislative liaison between the Air Force and Congress, eventually retiring at the rank of Colonel.

In 2018 Webster ran to replace retiring Republican Michael Corr. He won the general election with 56% of the vote, beating Republican Nick Fountain. Webster currently sits on the Appropriations, Finance, State Government, and Veterans Affairs & Emergency Preparedness committees.

His legislative priorities include providing quality education, protecting the commonwealthâ€™s natural resources and environment, combatting gun violence and providing access to affordable healthcare in order to promote a healthy workforce and enhance economic growth.
