Anthony Bellmon, a dedicated public servant, was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on November 8, 2022. He represents the 203rd Legislative District, which includes Olney, Lawncrest, Lawndale, Castor Gardens, and Oxford Circle.

Born and raised in the Northwest section of Philadelphia, Anthony's journey to public service began early. At the age of 13, he was accepted into the A Better Chance program and attended Mount Greylock Regional High School in Williamstown, Massachusetts. His academic journey continued at The George Washington University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science. Notably, Anthony was the first in his family to go to college.

Before his election, Anthony served for eight years in the office of Philadelphia Congressman Brendan F. Boyle. As a constituent service representative, he tackled housing, student loan, and immigration issues. Later, as a senior advisor to the congressman, he worked on Capitol Hill to advance policy issues to improve the lives of children and working families.

Anthony's commitment to education is rooted in his experience as a former educator in Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey. His time in the classroom and school administration reinforced his belief that education is a powerful tool to transform the lives of young people in underserved communities.

As a community organizer, Anthony is passionate about increasing voter participation in underserved communities. He has led various candidate and issue-based campaigns and serves as a committeeperson and on the executive board of the 61st Ward in Philadelphia. He has also served on the Friends of the Greater Olney Library and as a tutor and mentor to local children in his neighborhood.

In his role as a state representative, Anthony plans to address issues affecting his district such as making the community cleaner and safer, education and workforce development, mental health access, care for senior citizens, and much more. He is humbled by the opportunity to serve and is ready to work for his constituents in Olney and Northeast Philadelphia.
