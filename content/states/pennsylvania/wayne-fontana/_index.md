Wayne D. Fontana, born on March 12, 1950, is an American politician who has been serving as a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania State Senate, representing the 42nd District since 2005.

Born and raised in the Beechview section of Pittsburgh, Fontana graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County in 1971 with an Associateâ€™s Degree in Business. Before his political career, he was a truck driver and a member of Teamsters Locals 249 and 211. He later transitioned into real estate and worked for Howard Hanna Real Estate Services as a sales manager and associate broker.

Fontana's political career began as a Democratic committee member in Pittsburgh's 19th Ward, and he later rose to vice chair of the Allegheny County Democratic Committee. In 1999, he was elected as an original member of Allegheny County Council (representing District 12) after it was formed under the new home-rule charter. He served as the council's vice president from January 2004 to March 2005.

In January 2005, Senator Jack Wagner resigned from the 42nd District of the Pennsylvania State Senate after having been elected Pennsylvania Auditor General. Fontana won the May 17, 2005 special election for the remainder of Wagner's term, winning 55% of the vote and defeating his closest opponent, Democrat-turned-Republican state Representative Michael Diven. Fontana was re-elected in 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018.

Fontana is married to Francine Fontana and they have three children. They reside in the Brookline section of Pittsburgh.
