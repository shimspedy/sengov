Jose Giral, a dedicated public servant and a resident of Philadelphia for over two decades, has made significant contributions to his community through various roles. He was elected to represent Pennsylvania’s 180th Legislative District in Philadelphia on November 8, 2022.

Before his election, Giral owned and operated a small business in Philadelphia, demonstrating his entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to the local economy. His deep involvement in the community extended to political service as well, as he served as the Democratic committeeman for the 33rd ward for eight years.

In addition to his business and political endeavors, Giral served as a commissioner for Governor Tom Wolf’s Advisory Commission on Latino Affairs. This role allowed him to advocate for the Latino community and contribute to policy discussions at the state level.

Giral's commitment to public service is also evident in his collaboration with former state representative Angel Cruz. Their joint efforts have been instrumental in addressing the needs and concerns of the 180th Legislative District.

In the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Giral is part of several committees. These include the Aging & Older Adult Services Subcommittee on Programs and Benefits, Game & Fisheries, Human Services Subcommittee on Drugs and Alcohol, Labor & Industry, and Liquor Control Subcommittee on Licensing.

Giral's personal history includes his education at W.H. Maxwell Career and Technical High School, from which he graduated in 1989. Despite his numerous responsibilities and commitments, Giral remains single and continues to dedicate his time and energy to serving the people of Pennsylvania.
