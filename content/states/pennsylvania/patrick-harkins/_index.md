Patrick J. Harkins is an American politician serving as a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 1st District. He was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania, the youngest of five children of the late Bernard "Babe" and Rita Harkins.

Harkins graduated from Technical Memorial High School in 1982 with a certificate in electronics. He went on to study political science at Mercyhurst College and Penn State Behrend.

Before his political career, Harkins worked as a driver for United Parcel Service for 23 years, interacting with people from all walks of life in Erie. He also became active in the local Teamsters Union, Teamsters LU 397.

In addition to his work, Harkins has been involved in various community activities. He founded the "Reservoir Dogs" neighborhood crime watch program and served as a judge of elections in Erie. He is a member of the Northwest Pennsylvania Apartment Association and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

Harkins was first elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2006, when the district opened up after Rep. Linda Bebko-Jones retired following a challenge to the validity of her petition signatures. He won a three-way primary election over Democrats Michael Skrzypczak and Dennis Iaquinta and went on to defeat Republican Christine Pontoriero with 75% of the vote.

In the House, Harkins sits on several standing committees, including Labor Relations, Liquor Control, Education, and Children and Youth, of which he is secretary.

On a personal note, Harkins and his wife Michelle have three children: twin sons Matt and Pat, and daughter Barbara.
