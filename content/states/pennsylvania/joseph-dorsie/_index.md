Joseph Frank D'Orsie, commonly known as Joe D'Orsie, is an American politician who has been serving as a Republican representative for the 47th District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since 2023.

Born around 1986 in York County, Pennsylvania, D'Orsie was raised in Dallastown. He completed his high school education at Dallastown Area High School. Later, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in public relations from Duquesne University.

In 2012, D'Orsie served as a missionary with Youth with a Mission in the Dominican Republic. From 2016 to 2022, he worked as the communications director at Praise Community Church, an affiliate of the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee).

D'Orsie's political career began in earnest in 2022 when he defeated incumbent Pennsylvania State Representative Keith Gillespie in a Republican primary challenge. He then went on to win the general election to represent the 47th District unopposed. His success in the primary was viewed as a backlash from the further right because the incumbent had not been as hard-line on conservative issues. D'Orsie is a member of the Pennsylvania State Freedom Caucus.

D'Orsie has taken clear stances on several key issues. He opposed the concept of banning books and claimed that any talk of a book ban was a deception perpetrated by the media. He also opposed mitigation mandates related to the COVID-19 pandemic, referring to such mandates as "unconstitutional" and an "abuse of power." He argued it was for individuals themselves to respond how they saw fit. On the issue of taxation, D'Orsie supports abolishing school taxes and announced plans in 2023 to draft a bill that would repeal Pennsylvania's automatic gas tax increase.

D'Orsie currently resides in Mount Wolf, Pennsylvania, with his wife, Adrienne, and their two children.
