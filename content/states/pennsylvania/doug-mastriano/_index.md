Douglas Vincent Mastriano was born on January 2, 1964, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He is the son of Italian Americans Richard L. and Janice C. (Bono) Mastriano. Raised in Hightstown, New Jersey, he graduated from Hightstown High School in 1982. He was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and obtained the rank of Eagle Scout.

Mastriano attended Mercer County Community College, where he was a member of Psi Beta and Phi Theta Kappa. He is a combat veteran and the son of a career US Navy man. He worked as a paperboy, janitor, security guard, short-order cook, pizza delivery person, and dishwasher.

He was commissioned in the U.S. Army in 1986 and served on the Iron Curtain with the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in West Germany. While serving along the East German and Czechoslovakian borders, he witnessed the end of the Cold War and thereafter deployed to Iraq for Operation Desert Storm (1991) to liberate Kuwait. His regiment led the attack against Saddam’s elite Republican Guard forces.

Mastriano went on to serve in Washington, DC, the 3rd Infantry Division, and US Army Europe. After 9/11, Mastriano was the lead planner for the operation to invade Iraq via Turkey. He served four years with NATO and deployed three times to Afghanistan. Mastriano was the director of NATO’s Joint Intelligence Center in Afghanistan, leading 80 people from 18 nations. On his own initiative, Doug led seven relief operations to help Afghan orphans.

He completed his career as a Professor of the U.S. Army War College (PAWC), Carlisle, PA, and taught Strategic Studies at the Master Degree level to the next generation of senior leaders. Mastriano is a Doctor of History (PhD) and has four master’s degrees: Strategy, Strategic Intelligence, Military Operations, and Airpower.

He led the search to locate where America’s greatest WW I hero, Alvin York, received the Medal of Honor and led the construction of a three-mile trail, with two monuments and nine markers in the Argonne Forest of France. He published 30 articles on strategy and historic topics and authored the book Alvin York: A New Biography of the Hero of the Argonne which received four awards.

His new book, Thunder in the Argonne is the first to tell the complete story of America’s largest battle, the 1918 Meuse-Argonne Campaign. Doug’s next book, Pershing’s Lieutenants, was just released and is an edited work that focuses on the leadership style of American officers in the First World War.

Mastriano has appeared on Tucker Carlson, C-Span, numerous national radio programs (John Batchelor Show, Eric Metaxas Show) and on Fox Business with Stuart Varney. He retired from the U.S. Army in November 2017 after 30 years of active duty as a Colonel.

In 2018, he was a candidate for Pennsylvania’s 13th U.S. Congressional District, where he overwhelmingly won Franklin and Fulton Counties and placed 3rd (of 8 candidates) in Adams and Cumberland Counties. Doug is married to Rebecca (Stewart), whose ancestors settled this region of Pennsylvania in 1732. Rebecca was a chaplain with Marketplace Ministries at Martin’s Famous Pastry Shoppe. Their son Josiah is a graduate of Liberty University, and an Eagle Scout, Canadian Chief Scout and recipient of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Gold, Silver and Bronze Awards.

Douglas Vincent Mastriano is an American far-right politician and retired military officer who has served in the Pennsylvania Senate since 2019, representing the 33rd district. A member of the Republican Party, he was also the party's nominee in the 2022 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election. Born in New Jersey, Mastriano served in the United States Army from 1986 to 2017 and attained the rank of colonel. He ran for U.S. Congress in Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district in 2018, where he finished fourth in the primary. Mastriano won the state senate seat for the 33rd District the following year in a special election.
