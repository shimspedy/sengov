Jake Banta, born around 1965, is an American politician and musician who currently represents the 4th District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since 2023. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Banta was born in Waterford, Pennsylvania, and grew up on his family's farm in LeBoeuf Township, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Fort LeBoeuf High School in 1983, Banta enlisted in the United States Navy, ultimately becoming a Navy SEAL. He was honorably discharged after his service.

Following the 9/11 attacks, Banta worked as a security contractor with the U.S. Department of Defense in the Middle East. In 2022, Banta ran to represent the 4th District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, following the retirement of Curt Sonney. He won the six-person Republican primary election, and went on to defeat Democrat Chelsea Oliver in the general election.

Banta has described himself as "pro-life". He has previously said he does not support a ban on abortion, but has suggested he would be open to one which makes exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. Banta opposed mandates put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. He has promoted using Ivermectin to treat COVID, despite there being no medical basis for the use of the drug in treating the disease. According to Banta, he was let go as a military contractor over his refusal to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, Banta said he now regrets receiving other vaccinations that were required of him when joining the military.

Banta has spoken of a "plandemic" conspiracy and claimed COVID-19 was created by Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci, and China as part of a globalist plot to depopulate the world. He also claims the COVID vaccine has killed more people than the virus itself. In a Gab post, Banta claimed COVID test swabs, masks, and COVID vaccines contain lethal amounts of graphene oxide.

Banta supports the overturning of Pennsylvania's mail-in voting law. He also supports voter ID, and advocates for the presence of serial numbers on ballots. Banta has used several social media sites, including Facebook, Gab, and Truth Social, to promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods sourced from various far-right websites. Some of his online comments caused his Facebook account to be suspended. He also claims the FBI visited his home in response to his rhetoric, a claim which has gone unverified.
