Tim Brennan, born around 1978, is an American attorney and politician who has represented the 29th District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as a Democrat since 2023. He was born in Pottsville, Pennsylvania and graduated from Nativity B.V.M. High School. He earned an associate degree from Ursinus College in 2000 and a law degree from the Widener University in 2003.

Brennan grew up waiting tables in his parents’ mom-and-pop restaurant. As a first-generation college graduate, he never expected to become an attorney or an elected official. However, he has spent the last 30 years fighting for equality, fairness, government reform, and working families as a councilperson, as an attorney, and as a volunteer.

He developed a strong sense of justice and equality at a young age. He worked his first election in 1988, aged 10, after viewing a political advertisement that exploited racial division, which led him to the belief that we deserve a higher standard of character from our elected officials. He looked up to his older sister and volunteered for the Women in Crisis Center she directed.

In law school, Brennan focused on legislation drafting and state constitutional law, and became certified in law and government. He fought for redistricting reform and drafted and lobbied for an amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution to stop partisan gerrymandering. He also studied international law, focusing on the European Convention on Human Rights and the return of the rule of law to Eastern Europe.

After law school, he began taking on insurance companies and fighting for injured workers — including women who were assaulted while at work. When the eyes of the country were on Pennsylvania, he helped beat Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani in court, pushing back against their attacks on facts and our democracy.

In his law practice, Brennan represents injured workers as one of only about 200 Pennsylvania attorneys certified as specialists in workers’ compensation law. In addition, he has represented municipal governments in the Commonwealth for nearly two decades, and previously worked for the Pennsylvania Governor’s Office of General Counsel, representing the Department of Transportation.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court appointed Brennan as a Senior Hearing Panel Member for the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. He also provides pro bono representation to the LGBTQIA+ community, struggling homeowners, first responders, and historical groups.

Brennan has served as an educator, a professor in one of our exceptional community colleges, and an instructor on animal law and right-to-know law for other attorneys. While serving on the Doylestown Borough Council, Brennan fought for our shared values. After a hate group came to Central Bucks West High School, he worked with another council member on a response that led to Doylestown’s first Pride event. He has consistently voted to protect LGBTQIA+ rights, to maintain a more sustainable future for our environment, and to demand action on gun violence.
