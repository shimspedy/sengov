Jennifer O'Mara was born on November 12, 1989, in Southwest Philadelphia. She is the oldest of three children. When she was 13 years old, her father, a union firefighter, died by gun suicide. This tragic event led Jennifer and her family to move to Delaware County, where her mother found a job as a school bus driver. Despite the hardships, Jennifer's family managed to get through thanks to essential public services, her father’s union pension, and her mother’s union job.

After graduating from Interboro High School, Jennifer faced the familiar challenges of affording college as the daughter of a single mother with two younger brothers at home. However, by working three jobs, she was able to support herself through college and earn a dual degree from West Chester University with the help of financial aid and student loans. She studied history and secondary education, which led her to become a certified teacher.

Jennifer also holds a Master's Degree in Liberal Arts from the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied English and history. Her master's thesis was centered around creative methods for childhood grief. Prior to joining the state legislature, Jennifer was employed for almost seven years at the University of Pennsylvania. She served as the Assistant Director of University Stewardship, working alongside her colleagues to ensure that attending the University is affordable for students.

Jennifer's dedication to public service is deeply rooted in her own experiences. She believes there is more that unites us than divides us and is committed to being part of a government that serves the people. As a state Representative, Jennifer is committed to improving public education for our children, protecting our communities from the dangers of gun violence, ensuring access to affordable health care, and expanding job opportunities at all skill levels.

Jennifer was elected to represent the 165th Legislative District on November 6, 2018. The district includes parts of Springfield Township, Marple Township, Radnor Township, and the borough of Morton. She was the first Democrat and the first woman to represent the district. She ran for re-election in 2020 and retained her seat by defeating her opponent with 51.51% of the vote.

Jennifer is also a member of the Board of Directors for Pennsylvania Association of Student Councils (PASC). She has served as an advocate with the Department of Veterans Affairs for her now-husband, a combat veteran, and two-time Purple Heart recipient. Jennifer and her husband were married in 2017 and live in Springfield with their rescue dog, Ladybug.
