Elder Vogel, Jr. was born on July 9, 1956, in Rochester, Pennsylvania. He is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania State Senate and has been representing the 47th district since 2009.

Before his political career, Vogel was a fourth-generation dairy farmer who operated his family's farm in New Sewickley Township. He also served as a New Sewickley Township supervisor.

On November 4, 2008, Vogel was elected to the State Senate, succeeding the retiring Democrat Gerald LaValle. He defeated his opponent, Jason Petrella, by a margin of 56.8% to 43.2%. His original opponent, State Representative Sean Ramaley, had dropped out of the race due to alleged involvement in the bonusgate scandal.

In the Senate, Vogel serves as Chairman of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, Vice-Chairman of the Senate Local Government Committee, and also sits on the Appropriations, Environmental Resources & Energy, Public Health & Welfare, and Urban Affairs & Housing Committees.

Throughout his tenure, Senator Vogel has been the driving force behind several measures he introduced and have since been enacted into law. Among them: Eliminating the statutory requirements for costly low Reid Vapor Pressure “Summer Gas” gasoline in seven southwestern Pennsylvania counties. Extending the life of the First Industries Program, an initiative that focuses on saving and creating jobs in the Tourism and Agriculture sectors. Eliminating the ability of the Department of Agriculture to cite non-profit community groups such as volunteer fire companies, churches, and school booster clubs for selling non-hazardous home-baked food at fundraisers. Giving school districts and school bus contractors the option to choose the most appropriate school buses based on their needs.

For the last five legislative sessions, Senator Vogel has championed legislation to expand telemedicine in Pennsylvania in the effort to reduce costs and improve the level of care provided to patients, especially those living in areas currently underserved by “bricks and mortar” medical facilities. During the 2019-20 Session, his Senate Bill 857, which addressed this issue, received approval from the General Assembly; however, it was ultimately vetoed by the Governor in April 2020.

Additionally, he has been an advocate for legislation that would expand access to sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) across the state and ensure quality care for victims of sexual assault. Currently, his Senate Bill 414 resides in the House Health Committee following its unanimous approval from the Senate.

As a fierce advocate for the Pennsylvania’s agriculture industry and its importance to this commonwealth, Senator Vogel led the effort to enact Farming First legislation to support current farmers and ensure our agricultural heritage is handed down to future generations. He has also supported efforts to protect and bolster Pennsylvania’s horse racing industry and provide needed updates to the state Race Horse Industry Reform Act.

Furthermore, Senator Vogel introduced measures to alleviate the burden on motorists by exempting light passenger vehicles 10 years old or newer and alternative fuel vehicles from vehicle emissions inspections as well as eliminating outdated gasoline requirements making gasoline cheaper for western Pennsylvania motorists.

Back in the district, he serves on the Board of Directors for the Lawrence County Community Action Partnership; and is a member of the Beaver County Chamber of Commerce, the Lawrence County Chamber of Commerce and the Butler County Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association, the Beaver-Lawrence Farm Bureau, the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, and the Big Knob Antique Tractor and Equipment Association.
