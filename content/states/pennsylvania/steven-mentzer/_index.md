Steven C. Mentzer, born on October 24, 1956, is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He has been representing the 97th District since 2013.

Mentzer graduated from Manheim Township High School and attended Elizabethtown College, but did not graduate. Before his political career, Mentzer spent several decades working in finance. He held an accounting position at Merrill Lynch and later served as a financial advisor at Smith Barney.

In 2009, Mentzer began his political career when he won, unopposed, the race for Manheim Township Treasurer. During his term as treasurer, he ran for the state house position in 2012 after incumbent John C. Bear dropped out after winning the Republican primary. Mentzer won unopposed in the general election. He has successfully run for re-election in the subsequent four general elections.

Mentzer is not just a politician, but also a humanitarian. In 2007, he founded Central American Relief Efforts, a small nonprofit organization. He has been heavily involved in a variety of humanitarian efforts, both locally and globally, since 2006. As president of the Central American Relief Efforts, he headed a non-profit organization that mobilizes U.S. volunteers and humanitarian aid to impoverished areas of Central America.

For the 2023-24 Session, Mentzer has been appointed to serve as the Republican Chairman of Aging and Older Adult Services Committee. He is currently a member of the Aging & Older Adult Services, Insurance, Professional Licensure, and Tourism & Recreational Development committees.

Mentzer and his wife, Sally, currently reside in Manheim Township and have two children.
