Keith J. Greiner is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He has represented the 43rd district, based in eastern Lancaster County, since 2013. Born on May 2, 1965, Greiner graduated from Conestoga Valley High School and received a bachelor's degree in accounting from Penn State University. He has worked for over 25 years as a certified public accountant.

Greiner entered electoral politics by successfully running for the Upper Leacock Township Board of Supervisors. At the time of his election to Harrisburg, he was the incumbent Lancaster County Controller. In his sixth term, Rep. Keith J. Greiner, has been named Republican chairman of the House Finance Committee, which enables him to continue in his role as a fiscal watchdog for the 43rd District and Pennsylvania.

As a certified public accountant (CPA), Keith brings his expertise in auditing, accounting and tax law to the Capitol to defend Pennsylvania’s taxpayers and work to ensure state government operates efficiently. Keith gained an understanding of sound financial practices and the needs of the private sector during his nearly 25 years of experience in the business world. He works to correct out-of-control government spending and overregulation to prevent it from hindering employers and job creation. By promoting tax fairness, he aims to help Pennsylvania families to thrive and employers to compete more effectively.

Along with job creation, Keith focuses on state and municipal pension reform. He believes public employees should receive the same benefits as the people for whom they work, and he uses his expertise in accounting to help resolve Pennsylvania’s multi-billion-dollar public pension quagmire. Keith does not accept taxpayer-funded per diems, vehicles, meals or cell phones. His fiscal insight will continue to be an advantage in the state budget process as he fights to ensure Pennsylvania focuses its limited resources on important priorities, such as job creation, education and agriculture, while also concentrating on cutting debt and wasteful spending.

A lifelong resident of Lancaster County, Keith understands and shares the values of the people he serves and steadfastly defends them at the state Capitol. No stranger to public service, Keith served as Lancaster County Controller where he kept a watchful eye on county government finances and helped to hold the line on property taxes. Prior to that he was elected supervisor of Upper Leacock Township and served as an elected auditor. He is an active volunteer with the Upper Leacock Fire Company where he served as a firefighter for many years and its fire prevention coordinator.

Keith is a graduate of Penn State University and is a life member of its alumni association. He has served for 20 years as a board member of the Ressler Mill Foundation, and currently as its president. He also served as a member of the American Business Club (AMBUCS) of Lancaster for nearly 25 years and is a past vice president helping individuals with disabilities. He also served for many years in church leadership. The 43rd Legislative District is comprised of the boroughs of Akron, Ephrata, and New Holland; and the townships of Earl, Ephrata, Leacock, Upper Leacock and West Earl.
