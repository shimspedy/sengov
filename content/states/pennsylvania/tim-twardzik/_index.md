Timothy "Tim" Twardzik is an American businessman and politician. He is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 123rd district in Schuylkill County since 2021. Twardzik is the first Republican to represent the 123rd Legislative District in more than fifty years.

Twardzik was born in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, United States. He graduated from Shenandoah Valley High School in 1977 and from the University of Notre Dame in 1981. He is the son of Ted Twardzik, founder of Mrs. T's Pierogies.

Before his public service, Twardzik served as an executive vice president at Ateeco Inc., the marketer of Mrs. T's. In 2020, Twardzik was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives representing the 123rd district, which is part of Schuylkill County. He defeated Democratic candidate Peter Symons with 62.6% of the vote in the general election. Twardzik currently sits on the Commerce, Education, Health, and Urban Affairs committees. In 2022, Twardzik was opposed by Kathy Benyak. Twardzik won, gaining nearly 70% of the vote.

Twardzik is serving his second term in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives with a focus on creating jobs, assisting small business owners, advocating for better healthcare, fighting community blight, and providing outstanding constituent services for neighbors in the 123rd District. Twardzik was appointed to the following House committees for the 2023-24 Legislative Session: Commerce, serving as the Republican chair for the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Health, Housing and Community Development, serving as the Republican secretary, Legislative Budget and Finance, Tourism and Economic and Recreational Development. Twardzik is also a member of the following caucuses: Coal, Film Industry, Polish and Slavic American, Pro-Life, Sportsmen.

Twardzik spearheaded Act 11 of 2023, which aims to ensure that tobacco companies will continue to honor their agreements under the 2003 Tobacco Product Manufacturer Directory Act Master Settlement Agreement. This agreement defines how money is used for the health care of individuals with smoke-related illnesses and educating our youth about the dangers of tobacco use. Most notably from the last legislative session, Tim’s bill to provide more secure health care ID badges was signed into law by Gov. Tom Wolf. Act 79 of 2022 amends the Health Care Facilities Act (HCFA) requirements regarding photo identification badges in health care facilities. Additionally, his legislation to fix the unfair Unemployment Compensation (UC) rate increases placed on small businesses closed during the pandemic shutdowns was also signed into law as Act 156 of 2022.

Twardzik continued his mission to fight blight in Schuylkill County with legislation he introduced that would create the Vacant Property Registration Act (House Bill 1791). The measure would allow communities to create and maintain a vacant property registration program, which is a blight fighting, smart growth tool used to stabilize and redevelop neighborhoods.

He is the retired executive vice president and co-owner of Ateeco Inc - Mrs. T’s Pierogies. He helped grow the business founded by his father, Ted, into the community’s leading employer. He is a graduate of Shenandoah Valley High School and the University of Notre Dame, where he was a four-year Monogram Letter winner in track. Twardzik was a three-sport athlete in high school, winning multiple District XI titles and a state medal in the 330-meter intermediate hurdles. He was also inducted into his high school’s Wall of Fame in 2000 and Sports Hall of Fame in 2023.

Twardzik is active with a variety of community organizations and currently serves as secretary of the Lehigh Valley Health System – Schuylkill Board of Directors. He is past president of the Lehigh Valley Chapter of Legatus (the international organization of Catholic CEOs). Twardzik also served as chairman of the Schuylkill Economic Development Corporation and Schuylkill County Industrial Development Authority.
