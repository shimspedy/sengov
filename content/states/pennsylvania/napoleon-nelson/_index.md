Napoleon J. Nelson, Sr. is an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party. He represents District 154 in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

Nelson was elected to represent the 154th Legislative District in November 2020. He is the current chair of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus and serves on the Appropriations, Children and Youth, and Education committees. He is also a member of several other caucuses including the Emerging Technologies Caucus, Asian Pacific American Caucus, LGBTQ Equality Caucus, Mental Health Caucus, PA Black Maternal Health Caucus, and Womenâ€™s Health Caucus.

Before his political career, Nelson attended Central High School and graduated in 1998. He then graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2002 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and earned an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 2007.

Nelson served as Board Director for the Cheltenham school district from 2011 to 2017, and became the Finance Officer for Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania in 2018. In 2019, former state representative Steve McCarter announced that he would not seek re-election in 2020, and Nelson ran for the open seat. He won a six-way Democratic primary with 39.2% of the vote, and went on to win the general election with 77.5% of the vote. He assumed office on December 1, 2020, becoming the first black state representative for Pennsylvania's 154th District.

Nelson currently sits on the Aging & Older Adult Services, Children & Youth, Education, and Finance committees. His career experience includes working as a financier.
