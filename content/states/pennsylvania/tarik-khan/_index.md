Tarik Khan is an American politician and a current Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 194th District since 2022. His district includes Andorra, Chestnut Hill, East Falls, Manayunk, Roxborough, and Wissahickon.

Born on October 14, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Tarik is the son of a Pakistani immigrant father and a Catholic mother. His father, Zia, came to the US in 1964 to attend graduate school at The University of Pennsylvania and met Patricia Klein, a nurse of German, Polish, and Scottish descent at a Philadelphia party. Tarik grew up Muslim in a Jewish neighborhood in Philadelphia.

Tarik attended Joseph J. Greenberg School, a public K-8 school in Bustleton, Philadelphia and graduated from Central High School of Philadelphia in 1996. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Davidson College in 2000. He was an intern on The Tonight Show in college and later worked as a production assistant on the show. He graduated from Roxborough Memorial Hospital School of Nursing as a Graduate nurse in 2003, and later earned a Master of Science degree in nursing from the School of Nursing at La Salle University. Tarik earned a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 2023.

Tarik co-created a non-profit called Enabling Minds to help children with developmental disabilities in Croix-des-Bouquets attend school for the first time in their lives. He served as President of The Pennsylvania State Nurses Association (PSNA). As PSNA President, Tarik led the successful effort to help Pennsylvania join the Nurse Licensure Compact, cancel a quarter-million in patient medical debt, and built a coalition with nursing unions and advocacy organizations to help write and introduce the landmark nursing safe staffing legislation the Patient Safety Act.
