Representative Bob Merski is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 2nd Legislative District. His commitment to public service is deeply rooted in his upbringing in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he was born and raised. He is the son of the former Erie County Sheriff Robert Merski, from whom he learned the importance of community leadership and the balance of personal humility with a steadfast commitment to understanding the needs of the community.

Inspired by his father's service, Merski decided to run for a seat on the Erie City Council. In 2011, he was elected, becoming one of the youngest ever to serve on the council. His educational background includes a degree in Elementary Education from Mercyhurst University, which he earned in 1999, and a master's degree in Educational Development and Strategies from Wilkes University, which he received in 2015.

Before his political career, Merski was an educator in Erie's Catholic Schools, the Corry School District, and most recently, in the Erie City School District for 16 years. He also served as a representative and officer in the Erie Education Association and the Northwestern Region of the Pennsylvania State Education Association.

In addition to his work in education and politics, Merski has been active in community service. He co-founded the South East Hills Neighborhood Watch in 2007 and the South East Erie Farmers Market in 2009. He has served on the boards of the Erie Arts Opportunity Local Education Fund, the Economics Pennsylvania Advisory Board, and the St. Vincent Health Center Foundation. He also served as co-chairman of the Young Erie Professionals Civic Engagement Committee.

Merski currently resides in the City of Erie with his wife, Emily, and their son, Robert.
