George Dunbar, born in 1960 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He represents the 56th Legislative District in Westmoreland County. His political journey began with his first election in November 2010. As of January 2019, he began his 5th term as State Representative.

Dunbar graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1978 and later from Robert Morris University with a B.S. in Business Administration in 1993. Before his political career, Dunbar served as Executive Vice President of Wright Industries Inc until 2005. He then opened and ran his own consulting business from 2005â€“2007. He also served as controller and Chief Financial Officer for Ryco Inc until his election to the House in 2011.

In his political career, Dunbar has been active and influential. He was one of 75 members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly to sign a letter to the state's U.S. congress members on December 4, 2020, regarding an election review for the 2020 presidential election. The letter identifies election-related legal protections its signers believe were undermined, and asks that Congress "reject electoral votes that are not 'regularly given' or 'lawfully certified'", as they are enabled to do by federal law. Dunbar signed another letter to the state's attorney general the same day that requests a review of state policies and procedures during the 2020 presidential election, and seeks related reviews and recommendations.

Dunbar's committee assignments include the Committee on Committees and Rules. He is married to Sandra and they have four children. They reside in Penn Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.
