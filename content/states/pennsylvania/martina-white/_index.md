Martina A. White, born on July 7, 1988, is an American politician and a member of the Republican party. She represents the 170th district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, a position she has held since her first election in 2015.

White is a lifelong resident of Northeast Philadelphia and was the first new Republican elected in Philadelphia in 25 years. The 170th District includes the neighborhoods of Bustleton, Millbrook, Parkwood, and Somerton.

Before her political career, White worked as a financial advisor, guiding families and small business owners on how to best accomplish their financial goals. Her experiences in this role inspired her to seek office to assist working families across the Commonwealth.

White is the first member of her immediate family to graduate from college. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from Elizabethtown College in 2010. During her time at Elizabethtown College, she played field hockey.

In her political career, White has worked on various issues and delivered increased funding for school and the EITC program, public safety including concurrent jurisdiction for illegal firearm crimes as well as the impeachment of the Philadelphia District Attorney and increasing services for our seniors.

White currently serves as the majority caucus secretary. She is also a member of the Rules Committee and the Committee on Committees. On November 12, 2019, White was elected as chair of the Philadelphia Republican City Committee, a position she held until June 2022.

White's electoral history is marked by success. In the 2015 Pennsylvania State Representative special election for the 170th district, she won with 55.83% of the votes. She has since been re-elected in 2016, 2018, and 2020, demonstrating her continued support from her constituents.
