Greg Scott is a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the newly created 54th Legislative District in Montgomery County since his election in November 2022. This seat represents the communities of Conshohocken, Plymouth Township, and Norristown in Harrisburg.

Born and raised in Norristown, Greg was brought up by his mother, Peggy, who was active in the community and instilled a sense of public and community service in him at an early age. He saw firsthand the definition of hard work, grit, and determination.

In 6th grade, Greg met President Bill Clinton when he came to speak in Pennsylvania. Greg shook the president’s hand and asked him about health care and education policies. He challenged the president to put his money where his mouth is and shortly thereafter, President Clinton visited Greg’s school district to announce an education initiative at Norristown High School. Through this experience, Greg saw how government could work for the people.

In high school, Greg became Norristown’s first Junior Borough Councilman and joined the Norristown Fire Department at age 16. He became a volunteer EMT for Plymouth Community Ambulance Association the following year. Greg continues to serve his community as a volunteer firefighter for Fairmount Engine Co. #2.

During the pandemic, Greg stepped up and mobilized the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium to provide more than 2,000 COVID tests and distribute more than 3,200 vaccines to the community through a partnership with private and public entities within the community.

Greg went on to earn degrees from Chestnut Hill College and the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. Greg also taught a “Liberty and Law” class as part of the civic program for Eisenhower Middle School, where he attended, so students could learn how the government can, and should, work to better our lives. Greg continues to be a high school mentor to many students in the Norristown School District.

After college, Greg served on the staff of two members of the U.S. Congress and went on to become chief of staff at an education and community development nonprofit founded by Kenny Gamble, a noted civic and entertainment industry leader.

In 2015, Greg ran and was elected as a Magisterial District Judge. Upon his commission, he became the first Black District Judge in Montgomery County history and the youngest sitting judge in Pennsylvania. On the bench, he became a leading voice for understanding trauma and its impact on people appearing in court rooms and has helped to create programs aimed at reducing recidivism and helping people gain access to services to assist with their mental health and well-being.
