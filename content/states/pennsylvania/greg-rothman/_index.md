Greg Rothman is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He is currently serving as the state senator for Pennsylvania's 34th District. Before this, he was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 2015 to 2022, representing the 87th District.

Rothman was born on December 10, 1966, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Cumberland Valley High School in 1985 and went on to receive a B.S. in political science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 1989. He also holds an M.S. in real estate from Johns Hopkins University, which he earned in 2005.

In addition to his political career, Rothman has a significant background in the military and real estate. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps for nearly 10 years, until 2001, and reached the rank of Staff Sergeant. He spent several decades in the real estate business, working as a real estate agent and then CEO of RSR Realtors, a real estate company based in Lemoyne. Rothman was also part owner of the Harrisburg Senators minor league baseball team.

Rothman's political career includes chairing the Bush-Cheney 2004 re-election campaign in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. He was a volunteer aide on Rick Santorum's 2012 presidential campaign. In August 2015, Rothman was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in a special election to fill a vacancy in the 87th House district. The vacancy arose from the resignation of Glen Grell, who stepped down to become executive director of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System. Rothman was reelected in 2016, 2018, and 2020.

Rothman assumed office as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate on December 1, 2022. His current term ends on November 30, 2026.
