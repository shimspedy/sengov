Dave Madsen is an American politician who is currently the representative for Pennsylvania's 104th District. He had previously served as a member of the Harrisburg City Council for five years starting in 2017.

Born and raised in South Central PA, Madsen graduated from Middletown in 2004. He lives in the Allison Hill section of Harrisburg. When Rep. Madsen is not advocating for his constituents, he enjoys watching soccer and riding his bike on the greenbelt.

Before being elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Madsen served as a member of the Harrisburg City Council for five years starting in 2017 as a Democrat. During his time as councilmen, Madsen fostered community outreach and worked as the AFL–CIO community services and education director. He was also the chair of the council’s public works committee.

As a member of City Council, one of his priorities was to replace aging infrastructure and to work to prevent blight by getting property owners the assistance they needed. Rep. Madsen also worked as the community services and education director for the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. During his tenure as director, he supported food distribution drives, pop-up COVID-19 vaccination clinics and promoted workforce programs.

Madsen announced he would run for Pennsylvania's 104th District as a Democrat which saw its longtime incumbent Republican Representative Sue Helm retire, as well as being redistricted to include Harrisburg. He ran on a campaign calling for increased funding for public education, workforce development and addressing infrastructure issues. He was endorsed by Dauphin County Commissioner George Hartwick and Harrisburg Mayor Wanda Williams, along with a number of Harrisburg, Steelton and county officials.

In the election he faced off against Keystone candidate David Kocur. He defeated Kocur with 11,563 votes or 70.5% of the electorate to Kocur's 4,838 votes or 29.5% of the electorate. Madsen took office at the opening of the Pennsylvania house on January 2, 2023.

As a State Representative, he will focus on funding for public education, workforce development, and improving infrastructure. He is committed to working on bipartisan action to bolster public health and safety while strengthening Pennsylvania’s economy.
