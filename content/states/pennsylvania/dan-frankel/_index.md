Representative Dan Frankel, a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, has always been an outspoken advocate for civil rights and public health. He champions legislation to bring equality to Pennsylvania for LGBTQ+ residents, stands in staunch opposition against efforts to limit women's healthcare options, and works tirelessly to end gun violence with common sense measures.

In the wake of the 2018 tragedy at the Tree of Life building, Representative Frankel assembled a coalition of community and faith organizations and others to fight for an update to Pennsylvania's laws to address hate crimes in a modern era. Currently serving as the Democratic chairman of the House Health Committee, he promotes science-based policies to protect and improve the public health of the Commonwealth. He serves on the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council to contain healthcare costs and support high-value care.

In addition, Rep. Frankel is co-chair of the PA SAFE Caucus and the founder and past chair of both the PA Women's Health Caucus and LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus. Representative Frankel serves the heart of Pittsburgh, representing the neighborhoods of Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, Greenfield, Oakland, Point Breeze, and Regent Square. As the Representative, he leads these communities with the same compassion and activism he sees from his neighbors.

An active member of his community, he works to build a thriving region for everyone. Representative Frankel sits on Allegheny County's Area Agency on Aging's Advisory Council, the State Employee Retirement System board, and the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy's Board of Directors. He also serves as the governor's representative to the Board of Trustees for the University of Pittsburgh.

Representative Frankel previously served as President of the Jewish Family and Children's Service board. In addition, he's honored to have participated in Pittsburgh's urban renaissance through his past work on the Urban Redevelopment Authority Board of the City of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau Board.

Representative Frankel is a graduate of the Pennington School (1974) and Kenyon College (1978). He completed a certificate program for senior executives in state and local government at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government (2000). Formerly an insurance executive, he served as a Vice President at Hilb, Rogal, & Hamilton Co. and a regional insurance brokerage firm, Frankel Co.

Representative Frankel resides in Squirrel Hill, down the street from the house he grew up in. He is married to Debra Frankel, a psychotherapist. Together, they have three grown children. Rep. Dan B. Frankel is serving the 23rd Legislative District.
