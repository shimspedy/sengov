An EMT and firefighter, Stender was elected to the Shikellamy School Board in 2021, after being unsuccessful in the primary election in 2019. In 2023, Stender was chosen for the Republican nomination in the special election to fill the 108th District seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. The seat was open following the election of Lynda Schlegel Culver to the Pennsylvania State Senate. The 108th was a solidly Republican district, and Stender won with the support of Culver. He was sworn in on June 5, 2023.

Stender resides in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, and has three daughters.
