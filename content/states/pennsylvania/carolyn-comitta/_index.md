State Senator Carolyn T. Comitta is a leader in championing our communities, defending our environment, and working to ensure a safer, cleaner, and brighter future for the next generation of Pennsylvanians and beyond.
From the classroom to the board room to the state legislature, Comitta has consistently advocated for the issues that matter to all residents and their families – quality education, affordable healthcare, sustainable energy, safe schools and neighborhoods, clean air and water, a competitive economy, strong transportation infrastructure, and communities that welcome and respect the contributions and dignity of every person.
Comitta is known for her success in building diverse coalitions, her resolve in tackling tough issues, large and small, and her ability to inspire the optimism and hope needed to prevail against seemingly overwhelming odds.
As a result of her leadership, Comitta was elected to serve as State Senator for Pennsylvania’s 19th District, representing the people of Chester County, in 2020.
In the Senate, Comitta serves as minority chair of the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee and on the Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Aging and Youth, Education, and Local Government Committees.
Before being elected state Senator, Comitta served two terms, beginning in 2016, as State Representative for the 156th Legislative District. In the House of Representatives, she served as Secretary of the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee and on the Appropriations Committee and the Aging and Older Adults Committee. Comitta was also Vice Chair of the Pennsylvania Joint Legislative Air and Water Pollution Control and Conservation Committee, Vice Chair of the Climate Caucus, Vice Chair of the House Southeast Delegation, and a member of the Pennsylvania Commission for Women.
Comitta was first elected to public office on West Chester Borough Council, where she served from 2006 to 2010. In 2010, she became the first woman and first bipartisan-elected mayor of West Chester. During her time on council and as mayor, she helped guide local, state, national and international organizations and gained a deep and broad knowledge of public policy and governance.
Comitta began her professional career as a public school teacher and curriculum advisor, developing special and gifted education programs for the Octorara Area School District. She has combined her lifelong passion for teaching and learning with the need to address the climate crisis threatening our planet. Comitta is an active member of World Information Transfer, a nonprofit United Nations NGO focused on educating people and communities about the connection between our environment and public health. Through her ongoing efforts, she has touched the lives of thousands of young people, opening their eyes and minds to the impacts of the environment on everyday life.
Beyond her legislative work, Comitta is Vice President of Thomas Comitta Associates, a town planning and landscape architecture firm committed to excellence in planning, design, environmental sustainability, education, and public health.
Comitta is also actively involved in a number of community efforts, including the Greater West Chester Chamber of Commerce, the Rotary Club of West Chester, the League of Women Voters, and has served on various boards at West Chester University, including the Dean’s Advisory Board to its College of Arts and Humanities.
Comitta lives in West Chester, Pennsylvania with her husband, Tom. They have two grown children and three young grandchildren.
