Clint Owlett is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 68th district. He assumed office on June 5, 2018.

Born and raised in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, Owlett grew up on a dairy farm in Middlebury Center. He attended New Covenant Academy High School and after graduating, completed an internship at Three Springs Ministries. There, he advanced to the position of director of program development and then general manager, before leaving to work at a ski resort.

In 2012, Owlett established his own construction and decorating company. He is married and has four children.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Owlett introduced legislation that would allow religious institutions to gather in-person. He voted twice to lift the governor's emergency order, once on May 28, 2020, and again on June 9, 2020.

Owlett has amended drug laws, introducing a bill to permanently place carfentanil on the list of Schedule II controlled substances. He has encouraged legislators to co-sponsor laws that would consider it a felony to deliver drugs that results in serious injury.

Owlett supports the deregulation of small farms and the promotion of dairy products. He supports efforts to prohibit plant-based milk from using the term "milk", and advocates for schools to provide larger quantities of dairy milk with school lunches.

In 2021, Owlett supported two bills in the Pennsylvania Legislature that would restrict abortion: a "heartbeat bill" and the Down Syndrome Protection Act, which would prohibit abortions based on prenatal Down syndrome diagnosis.

As of 2023, Owlett's committee assignments are Agriculture & Rural Affairs, Appropriations, Ethics, and Judiciary.
