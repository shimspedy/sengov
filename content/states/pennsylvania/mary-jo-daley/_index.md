Mary Jo Daley is a dedicated public servant who has been representing Montgomery County’s 148th Legislative District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since 2012. Her election to state office is a testament to her deep commitment to community service, environmental conservation, and social justice.

Daley's approach to politics is centered around getting things done and delivering services that people want and need. She is committed to focusing on the needs of her constituents through the assistance provided by a capable district office staff and extensive community outreach.

In her role as a representative, Daley has been a strong advocate for women's rights and non-discrimination in Pennsylvania. She has also been instrumental in examining how the state funds the services it provides. Currently, Daley serves as the Majority Chair of the House Tourism & Economic & Recreational Development Committee, co-chair of the bicameral, bipartisan Women's Health Caucus, and co-chair of the House Irish American Caucus. She is also a member of the House Rules Committee.

Daley's interest in public service was sparked by discussions around the dinner table with her family while growing up in Narberth with six younger siblings. These conversations covered a wide range of topics, including civil and human rights, the Vietnam War and activism, environmental issues, unionization, and the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. During her teen years, women’s liberation moved to the forefront, eventually fueling her strong interest in seeing more women in elected office.

Daley was born on September 16, 1949, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Predergast High School in 1967 and earned an associate's degree in Medical Secretarial Science from Gwynedd Mercy College. After graduation, she worked in the Nuclear Medicine Department at Hahnemann Hospital, married her high school sweetheart, and started a family.

Throughout her career, Daley has appreciated challenging policy work. She previously served as Minority Chair for the Finance Committee’s Select Subcommittee on Tax Reform and Modernization. Additionally, she worked on bringing down costs and increasing transparency for reviewing property assessments as part of her work on the Local Government Commission.

Daley's political journey is marked by resilience and determination. In 1998, she unsuccessfully sought election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. However, she did not let this setback deter her. After Representative Michael F. Gerber withdrew, the Montgomery County Democratic Committee chose Daley to replace Gerber as the nominee for the 148th District in the 2012 election. She defeated Republican candidate Mike Ludwig in the election and has been continuously re-elected ever since.
