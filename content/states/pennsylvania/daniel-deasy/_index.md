Daniel Deasy, often known as Dan Deasy, is a dedicated public servant and a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He has been serving the 27th Legislative District since he was first elected in 2008.

Born on August 1, 1966, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Deasy is a lifelong native of the 27th Legislative District. He attended Canevin Catholic High School and later pursued higher education at the University of Pittsburgh.

Before his political career, Deasy worked as a supervisor at Pittsburgh's Public Works Department. His commitment to public service led him to serve four years as a Pittsburgh city councilman. During his tenure, he fought for the reopening of Pittsburghâ€™s Zone 6 Police Station, which remains open today.

In the state House of Representatives, Deasy holds the position of the Democratic chairman of the House Liquor Control Committee. His legislative priorities are diverse and community-focused. They include expanding access to health care, supporting funding for education, strengthening penalties for crimes against children, supporting economic development that leads to job creation, expanding services for senior citizens and veterans, and addressing blight and abandoned properties in communities.

Deasy has a long history of community service. He has worked tirelessly to address housing concerns, secure funding for playgrounds and other community resources, obtain grant money for neighborhood revitalization, and advocate for public safety. His community service continues as he serves on many local nonprofit boards of directors.

On a personal note, Deasy is married to the former Kelly Skeba. They are proud parents of four children - Abby, Alyssa, Danielle, and Thomas - and reside in Westwood.
