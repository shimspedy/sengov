Lindsay Powell is an American politician and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 21st district. She was elected in a 2023 special election to succeed Sara Innamorato, who resigned on July 19, 2023, to focus on her campaign for Allegheny County Executive.

Powell graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology from Wheaton College. Later, she graduated with a Master of Science in public policy management from Carnegie Mellon University. Powell spent time teaching English in rural Malaysia after receiving the Fulbright Scholarship.

Powell has previously worked as an Assistant Chief of Staff for the City of Pittsburgh, focusing on city legislative priorities and department policy. Powell has also worked for Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries.

On July 19, 2023, then-incumbent Representative Sara Innamorato announced her resignation from the State House following her victory in the primary for Allegheny County Executive in May 2023. Later that month, the Allegheny County Democratic Committee selected Powell from a group of five candidates to be their nominee in the September special election to replace Innamorato. Powell defeated Republican Erin Connolly Autenreith with 65% of the vote. Powell was subsequently sworn in on October 2, 2023.

Powell served as director of workforce strategies for InnovatePGH, with a focus on creating employment opportunities for underrepresented technologists in the Pittsburgh tech ecosystem. Powell is an alumna of the Pittsburgh chapter of the New Leaders Council and a board member of NeighborWorksSWPA and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.

Key issues for Powell include safe and dignified housing for all, helping working families, assisting small businesses and strengthening the local economy, and increasing the number of community assets. Powell resides in Lawrenceville with her beloved dog, Willow.
