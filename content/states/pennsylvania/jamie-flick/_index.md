Jamie L. Flick is an American politician and businessman who represents the 83rd District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since 2023 as a member of the Republican Party.

Born around 1961 in Pennsylvania, Flick grew up on his family's farm in Lycoming County. He graduated from Jersey Shore Area High School in 1979 and earned an associate degree in software engineering from the Pennsylvania College of Technology in 1981.

Before his political career, Flick was a businessman from South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He became a co-owner of the Australian baseball team, the Sydney Blue Sox, in 2018. Prior to his run for Pennsylvania State Representative, Flick owned and managed Susquehanna Software, a software company located in Williamsport.

In 2022, Flick ran to represent the open 83rd District seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He defeated fellow Republican Ann Kaufman in the primary election and went on to win the general election unopposed. In 2023, Flick was the lone Republican co-sponsor on a bill to recognize same-sex marriage at the state level.

Flick currently sits on the State House's Children & Youth, Government Oversight, and Human Services Committees. He is a proud father of six kids, two of whom enlisted to serve our country. A graduate of the Pennsylvania College of Technology with a degree in software engineering, Flick founded Susquehanna Software, Incorporated, the No. 1 selling human services software provider in the Commonwealth. He also owns a real estate company and is part owner of the Sydney Blue Sox, a professional baseball team in Sydney, Australia.
