Joe Ciresi is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 146th district. The district, located in Montgomery County, includes all of Limerick Township, Lower Pottsgrove Township, Perkiomen Township, Royersford, Trappe, and parts of Pottstown.

Born on September 15, 1970, in East Northport, New York, Ciresi graduated from Northport High School, NY, in 1988. He then went on to earn a B.M. in music management from the University of Miami in 1992. Before his political career, he worked as a senior account manager at Playbill from 1993 to 2002 and as an advertising director at the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts from 2002 to 2018.

Ciresi's political career began when he was elected to the Spring-Ford Area School District School Board in 2003, representing the 3rd region. He served on the board until 2017. In 2016, he launched his campaign for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to represent the 146th District, challenging Republican incumbent Tom Quigley. Despite being endorsed by President Barack Obama, Ciresi was defeated in the general election by Quigley by nearly 600 votes.

However, in 2017, Ciresi announced he would challenge Quigley to a rematch for the 146th district. Both candidates were unopposed in their respective primaries. Receiving the endorsement of Barack Obama once again, Ciresi defeated Quigley in the general election, reversing his fortunes from 2016. In January 2020, Ciresi launched his re-election campaign. He was unopposed in the primary and faced Republican Tom Neafcy, a Limerick Township supervisor. Ciresi defeated Neafcy in the general election, winning nearly 57% of the vote.

In addition to his role as a representative, Ciresi also serves on several committees and caucuses. He is the Vice Chair of the Policy Committee and the Consumer Protection, Technology & Utilities Committee. He also serves on the Game & Fisheries Committee, the Liquor Control Committee, and the Tourism & Economic And Recreational Development Committee. Furthermore, he is the Vice Chair of the Southeast Delegation, the Co-Chair of the Arts & Culture Caucus and the Italian-American Caucus, and the Vice Chair of the Bipartisan Film Caucus. He is also a member of the Blue-Green Caucus, the Climate Caucus, the Early Childhood Education Caucus, the Emerging Technologies Caucus, the LGBTQ Equality Caucus, the PA One Caucus, and the PA SAFE Caucus.
