Gina H. Curry is a State Representative who was elected in a November 2021 special election to represent the 164th Legislative District in Delaware County. She is an educator with more than 20 years of experience working with youth and families. She is an advocate for equitable funding for education, economic development, and the need for affordable and safe housing.

Before being elected as a state representative, Gina worked as a Diversity Equity and Inclusion/Racial Equity consultant and trainer. She was also a small business owner of Coach Your Vision LLC. She served in many community-based roles including serving as vice president of the Upper Darby School Board, where she was first elected in 2017 and re-elected in 2019.

Gina brings to Harrisburg a strong understanding of community needs, fairness, and grassroots advocacy in education and real estate/housing. This will help her fight for equity for all Pennsylvanians. She received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Criminal Justice with a concentration on Sociology from St. Joseph’s University. She also has experience in the behavioral health field as a clinical supervisor, behavioral specialist, and therapeutic consultant to children and families.

Gina enjoys supporting and mentoring youth and young professionals in leadership skills development, volunteerism, and civic engagement. Her youth advocacy began with her engagement with the Home and School Association at the Kindergarten Center and at Highland Park Elementary School. She also was committed to working as a local Girl Scout Troop leader for years, encouraging leadership development in elementary- and middle school-age girls.

Gina is an active member of the Chester Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. and an active member of the EU PEAT: Prison Education Advisory Board, where the goal is to support education rights and healthy reintegration for incarcerated residents, to provide hope ‘outside the bars.’ She lives with her husband and with her three children in the Upper Darby area.
