Scott Martin is a lifelong Lancaster County resident with deep roots in the community. He was elected to his first term representing the 13th Senatorial District in November 2016 and re-elected in 2020.
While in the Senate, dozens of Scott’s bills have become law as well as a Constitutional Amendment which was approved by Pennsylvania voters in May 2021 that limited the power of a governor to issue open-ended emergency declarations that last longer than necessary.

Scott currently serves as Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a crucial role in negotiating and developing the state budget and is responsible for reviewing all legislation for its fiscal impact. He previously served as Chair of the Senate Education Committee and Senate Local Government Committee.

Outside of his regular Senate responsibilities, Scott also serves as Chairman of the PA Athletic Oversight Committee and was elected to serve as Chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission (CBC) for 2023.
Prior to his election to the state Senate, Scott served as a Lancaster County Commissioner and helped to clean up what had become a dysfunctional and ineffective government. As Commissioner, Scott never voted for a tax increase, downsized government by cutting duplicative agencies and departments, reduced debt by $40 million, and lowered costs for taxpayers through privatization and public employee benefit reform.
He led many statewide reform efforts through the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania and was elected Chair of the Republican Caucus of County Commissioners for 8 years. Before entering public service, Scott was successful in the private sector as a licensed Realtor and local landlord. In addition, for 13 years, he worked in the Juvenile Justice system, including serving as Director of the Lancaster County Youth Intervention Center.

Running the county’s juvenile detention and emergency shelter-care facilities, he oversaw the effective operation of a $5.5 million budget and 150 employee organization. Scott was also the elected Vice President of the Juvenile Detention Centers Association of Pennsylvania and served on the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency’s Detention Steering Committee.
Scott served on the Board of Directors of the Dr. Gene A. Carpenter Football Foundation, volunteers as a youth sports coach in wrestling and football, and gave his time and effort to groups like the United Way of Lancaster County and the Pennsylvania Dutch Convention & Visitors Bureau.
Scott is a graduate of Lancaster Catholic High School where he was a PIAA & National Heavyweight wrestling champion, and Millersville University, where he graduated with a degree in Sociology/Criminal Justice and became a three-time 1st Team PSAC Defensive Tackle and two-time All-American. After his college career, Scott was a free agent camp invitee of the New York Giants in the NFL and had three different stints in the Arena Football league.

Scott has been inducted into the Lancaster Catholic Athletic Hall of Honor, the Millersville University Athletic Hall of Fame, the Lancaster-Lebanon League Wrestling Hall of Fame, the District III Wrestling Hall of Fame, the Lancaster County Sports Hall of Fame and the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame, Susquehanna Valley Chapter. Recently, in recognition of the 150th anniversary of college football, Scott was named one of the 150 greatest players/contributors in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference history, one of ten Millersville Marauders to earn that honor.
Scott and his wife Amber are the proud parents of four children: Alexia, Hayden, Alivia and Gavin.
