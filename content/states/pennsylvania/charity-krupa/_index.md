Charity Grimm Krupa is an American attorney and politician who has represented the 51st District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since 2023. She was born around 1980 near Fort Bragg, North Carolina, into a military family. She graduated from Albert Gallatin High School in 1998. In 2002, she attained a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Penn State University and a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from West Virginia University in 2005.

Krupa formerly clerked for Fayette County, Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas Judge Steve Leskinen. From 2012 to 2014 she served as Assistant Fayette County Public Defender. Krupa served on the Albert Gallatin Area School Board from 2017 to 2020. After Pennsylvania State Representative Matt Dowling was charged with driving under the influence, Krupa was selected by the Fayette County Republican Committee to replace him on the 2022 general election ballot. She went on to defeat Democrat Richard Ringer to represent the 51st District.

Krupa married her husband Brian J. Krupa while in law school and had their first child during her final year. They currently live on their cattle farm in Springfield Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania with their three children.

Blessed with a deep generational military and farm family background, strong Christian faith, and solid work ethic, Rep. Charity Grimm Krupa uses her diverse experience as a mother, wife, trusted local attorney and public servant to protect our constitutional rights against the woke agenda and big city politicians who threaten our way of life. As a former Albert Gallatin School Board member, she never voted for a tax increase, won the battle for increased transparency, and worked to end nepotism and insider hiring.

As your Representative, she will continue to protect and defend those rights. Just as important, Charity will fight for commonsense reforms in Harrisburg to reduce crushing inflation and make life more affordable for every working family through controlled spending, less regulation, and economic policies that increase opportunities for good paying, family-sustaining jobs. In the Pennsylvania House, she will continue to effectively advocate for parental rights to fully direct the upbringing of their children without government interference.

Charity fully understands the importance of standing with police, law enforcement and emergency responders while still protecting law-abiding citizens from government overreach, illegal search and seizures, and encroachment on our constitutional freedoms and liberties. As a long-time firearms owner and lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, she will always safeguard our God-given, non-negotiable right to keep and bear arms to lawfully defend ourselves, our loved ones and our property.
