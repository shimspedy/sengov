Morgan Cephas is a dedicated public servant and a native of West Philadelphia. She was elected to serve her first term in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in November 2016. As a lifelong public servant, Morgan has worked tirelessly to forge cross-sector collaborations and partnerships to solve some of the community’s biggest challenges.

Morgan is a product of public school and has worked tirelessly in the public sector, building her community block by block. At an early age, she realized that a community that offers safety, job security, access to quality education, and multi-generational recreational activities are key components to ensuring a neighborhood’s success.

In the General Assembly, Morgan's priorities include increasing education opportunities and career pipelines for youth and young adults, creating jobs through business expansion, providing resources to seniors, expanding access to health care to improve health outcomes, and ensuring women and girls are a priority in the assembly.

Since joining the PA House, Representative Cephas has introduced laws to end nuisance stop-and-goes, reverse the trend of maternal mortality, expand financial relief for childcare expenses, and to bring dignity for incarcerated women. Since her first term, she successfully secured over $12 million in state funds to improve local schools, parks, businesses, and libraries and to jumpstart community development projects in her district.

She currently sits on the Agricultural & Rural Affairs, Appropriations and Labor & Industry Committees, is a member of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus and chairwoman of the Women and Girls of Color subcommittee, a member of the Philadelphia Delegation and Vice Chairwoman of the Democratic Women’s Health Caucus.

Prior to her joining the legislature, Morgan served as the Deputy Chief of Staff to 4th District Councilman Curtis Jones Jr. in Philadelphia after she graduated with a degree in political science from the University of Virginia. As Deputy Chief of Staff, Morgan helped ensure the families in the district were able to live, work, and play in thriving neighborhoods. She also secured over $3 million to revitalize area commercial corridors; oversaw $6 million of improvements to upgrade recreation centers; and assisted in securing funds for improvements to local schools.

Expanding her experience beyond the walls of City Hall, Morgan joined the team at the Philadelphia Youth Network to focus more on increasing the education and workforce opportunities available to Philadelphia’s most vulnerable youth. During her time with the non-profit, Morgan was successful in helping to secure over $3 million in additional support for the WorkReady summer youth jobs program; close to $1 million to support the design and implementation of education and career pathways for youth; and worked alongside national organizations to shape the development of federal legislation dedicated to workforce development training programs for Philadelphia youth.

Not only has Morgan dedicated her career to serving her district and providing resources, she has been consistently involved in various volunteer efforts.
