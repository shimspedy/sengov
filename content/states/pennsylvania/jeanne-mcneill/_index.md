Jeanne McNeill is a dedicated public servant and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 133rd District. She was elected to serve in 2017 and has been a resident of the 133rd District for over 27 years. Born and raised in Bethlehem, she has raised two daughters, Kathleen and Shannon, along with her late husband, Daniel McNeill, who was also a state representative of the 133rd District.

Jeanne McNeill has always been a champion for those in need. For 14 years, she worked as a skills trainer at CLIU 21, teaching job skills, independence, and life skills to young adults with disabilities. This work aimed to provide these individuals with the independence, self-esteem, and opportunity they need to become productive members of society. Before becoming a skills trainer, Jeanne was employed by Parkland High School in the College Resource Room, where she assisted students with the difficult selection of which college to attend as well as their field of study.

Community service has always been a top priority for Jeanne. She has organized donations for fire victims, hosted fundraising events for cancer patients, served Thanksgiving dinners for those in need, and served spaghetti dinners at her church. Jeanne has always been there for friends and strangers alike and will bring that passion, dedication, and willingness to further serve the constituents throughout her legislative district.

Jeanne is committed to carrying on her late husband’s work, as was his wish, and continue to fight for working families, seniors and women’s rights, against discrimination of any kind, and the right for the physically and mentally challenged to have the same opportunities as the rest of the residents of this commonwealth. She is also committed to addressing the opioid crisis that is plaguing this state and taking more lives young and old every day. She will continue the shared vision of her late husband of bettering the lives of the residents of the 133rd District as well as those across Pennsylvania.

Jeanne lives in Whitehall Township, and spends her free time with her daughters and grandchildren Kenzie, Isabelle, and Lincoln. She attends community events as her schedule permits.
