Senator Devlin Robinson was elected in November 2020 to serve residents of the 37th Pennsylvania State Senatorial District, which includes parts of Allegheny County.

Robinson was raised in Brookline, a neighborhood in the south end of Pittsburgh, and attended Central Catholic High School. After graduation, he joined the United States Marine Corps – continuing a family tradition of military service dating back four generations.

Following the 9/11 attacks, Robinson requested assignment to the infantry, ensuring him a spot on the front lines. He served one combat tour in Afghanistan and two in Iraq, where as an infantryman in Nasiriyah (ambush alley) his unit fought door-to-door conducting searches in the days leading up to the subsequent rescue of Army POW Jessica Lynch. He also later served in Fallujah.

Upon his honorable discharge, Robinson returned home to Pittsburgh and founded his own company, Veterans Medical Technology and earned a business degree from Robert Morris University and an MBA from the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business.

Robinson has prime-sponsored an assortment of legislation with the following priorities: lowering and reforming tax codes; assisting and honoring veterans, first responders and law enforcement; supporting small businesses; enhancing manufacturing and labor opportunities; and many more. He has had six bills signed into law so far, which is well above average as a freshman senator. He also played a vital role in the opposition of PennDOT’s bridge tolling plan, vocalizing his disapproval and sponsoring legislation against it. Through his persistence and amplifying the voices of his constituents, PennDOT has permanently halted the bridge tolling initiative.

Robinson serves as the chair of the Labor and Industry Committee, vice chair of the Law and Justice Committee and is a member of the Appropriations, Banking and Insurance, Community, Economic and Recreational Development, Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure, and Local Government committees.

Robinson’s commitment to his fellow veterans never wavers as he serves on numerous veterans’ service organizations, as well as many other charitable organizations in and around southwestern Pennsylvania.

He is passionate about representing and serving his constituents, with two district offices available to assist with a variety of state-related issues.
