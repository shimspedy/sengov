Maureen Madden is a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving since 2017. She represents the 115th district and her tenure began on January 3, 2017. She succeeded David Parker.

Before her election to represent the 115th Legislative District, Rep. Maureen E. Madden was an educator at East Stroudsburg University, where she saw the impact of the budget cuts placed on universities due to decreased state funding.

Her legislative priorities include increasing higher education funding by eliminating corporate tax breaks, reforming property taxes, and securing additional state funding for basic education so public schools are fairly funded. She supports increasing the minimum wage and equal pay for equal work, and also will fight for additional state funding for local infrastructure projects, which will create jobs and improve communities.

Madden supports a moratorium on fracking of natural gas until safety measures are put in place to ensure that drinking water is safe and the risk of leaks are decreased. She also supports an extraction tax on natural gas companies so all Pennsylvanians can benefit from the growing industry.

She is a strong advocate for women’s health and a woman’s right to choose, as well as equal protections for LGBT residents. She attained her master's degree in communication arts from Marywood University and earned her bachelor’s degree in political science from Marymount Manhattan College.

Madden currently sits on the Education, Gaming Oversight, Human Services, and State Government committees. She has had a successful electoral history. In the 2016 Pennsylvania State Representative election for the 115th district, she received 11,845 votes (51.92%) against the incumbent Republican David Parker who received 10,969 votes (48.08%). In the 2018 election, she received 11,316 votes (60.11%) against David Parker who received 7,511 votes (39.89%). In the 2020 election, she received 17,605 votes (63.92%) against Republican Dulce Ridder who received 9,939 votes (36.08%).
