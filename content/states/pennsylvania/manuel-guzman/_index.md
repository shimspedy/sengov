Manuel (Manny) Guzman Jr. is a representative of the 127th Legislative District, having been elected in November 2020. He is a second-generation Latino and a graduate of Reading High School. Manny comes from a working-class family and is one of five siblings raised by a single mother. Despite the financial struggles they faced, such as sometimes having the electricity or heat cut off during the winter, these experiences have fueled Manny's passion to help working-class families and other marginalized people in society.

From an early age, Manny knew that his calling in life was service to others and the community. This was evident when he became involved in then-Senator Barack Obama’s presidential campaign while he was a student at Kutztown University. It was during this time that Manny started working towards his dream of becoming a political organizer.

At Kutztown University, Manny was involved with the student government association and university senate. In both roles, he became an advocate against rising tuition costs and for increasing academic standards. When he returned home from college, Manny recognized the need for leadership within his community. This realization led him to run for office.

In 2013, Manny was elected to the Reading School Board, where he served until 2017. Since then, Manny has been actively involved in electing Democrats across the Commonwealth as the Coalition’s Director with the Pennsylvania Democratic party. In this role, Manny has been key in engaging communities of color in cities that are often overlooked and disenfranchised.

In 2018, Manny led a team to help Governor Tom Wolf and U.S. Senator Bob Casey in their reelection campaigns. More recently, Manny served on President-Elect Joe Biden’s PA Campaign as the state-wide Latino vote director. Through this work, Manny has built relationships with many elected officials and community leaders across the Commonwealth. He looks forward to fighting for all marginalized communities across the Commonwealth.
