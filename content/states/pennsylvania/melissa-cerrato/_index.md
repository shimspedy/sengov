Melissa Cerrato, often referred to as Missy, is a dedicated member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 151st district. She assumed office on January 3, 2023, succeeding Todd Stephens. Her victory in the 2022 race, which she won by a narrow margin of fifty-eight votes, was a pivotal moment in Pennsylvania politics, flipping the House to the Democrats for the first time in twelve years.

Cerrato's campaign in 2022 was centered around key issues such as reproductive rights, funding public schools, sensible gun legislation, affordable living, and government accountability. Her win was a testament to her commitment to these causes and signaled a shift in the political landscape of Pennsylvania.

Beyond her political career, Cerrato has a rich personal life. She grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs and has raised her family in Horsham for over a decade. Her husband, John, is a member of the Steamfitters Local 420, and her four daughters, aged 9, 9, 17, and 18, all attend public schools.

Over the years, Cerrato has held a variety of jobs, from being a nanny to an Uber driver, an elder caregiver, and a housekeeper, to provide for her family. These experiences have given her a deep understanding of what it means to live paycheck to paycheck, but also the value of hard work in building a life to be proud of.

Before entering politics, Cerrato worked in the district office of her friend Liz Hanbidge, who won a seat in the PA House of Representatives. This position allowed her to help those in the community who were facing the same struggles she had faced, further fueling her desire to serve the public.

Today, Cerrato is ready to bring her background as a caregiver and public servant to Harrisburg. She is committed to fighting for reproductive justice, affordable child care, fairly funded public education, living wages, and fully funded public services across the commonwealth. She believes it is time to build a Pennsylvania that works for all of us.
