Jill N. Cooper is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving Westmoreland County. She is married to Leighton Cooper and they reside in Murrysville with their children, Shelby (a college senior) and Blake (a college sophomore), and their dog, Milo.

Jill Cooper was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives by the people of the 55th Legislative District on Nov. 8, 2022, and is serving her first term in office during the 2023-24 Legislative Session. She serves on the Aging & Older Adult Services, Housing & Community Development and Labor & Industry committees.

After graduating from Plum Senior High School and Grove City College, Jill began her professional career with the Alcoa Corporation, where she was employed for 14 years. She went on to become vice president of sales and marketing overseeing inside and outside sales staffs and traveled the world extensively for an Alcoa subsidiary until 2000, when she decided to step away from the business world to focus on raising her children.

She remained deeply involved in the community after retiring, serving on Parent Teacher Organizations and multiple other school and church groups. Additionally, Jill has been a member of the board of the Franklin Regional Adult School of Murrysville (where she also served as publicity chair), the Westmoreland and Fayette Workforce Investment Board, the Murrysville Economic and Community Development Corporation, and the Murrysville Library.

After witnessing the devastating impacts of forced closures and shutdowns implemented by the Wolf administration during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Jill fought diligently against the unilateral policies that harmed businesses, their employees, as well as Pennsylvania students, parents and seniors across the Commonwealth. She looks forward to working with other House members to continue fighting for the causes that matter, from commonsense election reforms that will restore public confidence in the power of their vote to tackling the deadly opioid crisis.

Among Jill's other top priorities as the 55th District's new representative are protecting citizens from destructive tax-and-spend policies, cracking down on job-killing over regulation and unwarranted government intervention in the daily lives of working people and families, and preserving opportunity and restoring Pennsylvania to prosperity so that future generations will continue to call the Keystone State home.
