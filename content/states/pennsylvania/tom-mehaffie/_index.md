Tom Mehaffie, born on February 22, 1971, is an American politician who has been serving in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 106th district since 2017. He is a member of the Republican party.

Before his political career, Tom relocated to South Central Pennsylvania when he purchased Breski Beverage Distributor more than 20 years ago. His focus on customer service helped the business become the premier beverage distributor in the Harrisburg area.

In 2014, Tom became president of the Lower Swatara Township Board of Commissioners. Elected to the Board in 2010, Tom also chaired the Public Works, Sewer Authority and Emergency Services committees for the township. His experience passing on-time budgets and keeping spending in check at the local level proves that he is a strong and effective voice for taxpayers of the 106th District.

Tom is also an active member of the community having served on the Dauphin County Planning Commission, the Dauphin County Library Board, the Lower Swatara Lions Club, the Zembo Shrine and the Prince Edwin Spring Creek Masonic Lodge. He also served on the executive board of the Pennsylvania State Association of Township Commissioners and as past president of the Malt Beverage Distributors Association of Pennsylvania.

In the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Mehaffie currently sits on the Consumer Affairs, Game & Fisheries, Gaming Oversight, and Professional Licensure committees. In February of 2023, Republican House Leadership informed Mehaffie that he would no longer have an office within the House. This action follows Mehaffie's reluctance to sign a letter needed for a parliamentary maneuver to bring the House to a voting session, a move that required support from all 101 Republicans.

Tom and his wife, Linda, who is a successful realtor, live in Lower Swatara Township.
