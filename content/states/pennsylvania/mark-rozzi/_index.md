Mark Lucio Rozzi, born on April 30, 1971, is an American businessman and politician. He served as the 142nd Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from January to February 2023. Currently, he serves as a representative for the 126th district.

Before his first campaign for state representative, Rozzi ran his familyâ€™s window and door installation business, which he sold in 2018. Rozzi is divorced and has one daughter. He was sexually abused and raped by a priest in the Roman Catholic Church as a child. Making it easier for victims to bring charges and file lawsuits against the accused has been one of his political objectives, as well as the reason why he ran for state representative.

On November 26, 2019, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf chose Muhlenberg High School, which is located in Rozzi's home district, as the location to sign new legislation which significantly overhauls the child sex abuse statute in Pennsylvania. The new law abolishes Pennsylvania's criminal statute of limitations on childhood sexual abuse and extends the timeline victims have to file civil action against their abusers. It also clarifies penalties for failure to report child abuse, makes conversations with law enforcement agents exempt from non-disclosure agreements, and creates a fund for victims of sexual abuse to pay for abuse-related therapy. Rozzi was among those who attended the signing ceremony.

In 2023, Rozzi was elected as Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, following speculation and disputes over which party controlled the legislature. He was nominated by Republican Representative Jim Gregory as a compromise candidate, earning bipartisan support. Following his election, Rozzi said he would govern as an independent and not caucus with either party. However, according to private conversations with fellow Democrats, Rozzi would not change his party registration. His private comments saying he would remain in the Democratic Party caused controversy with the Republicans who voted him for speaker, including Gregory, who said Rozzi should resign.
