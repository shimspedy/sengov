Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman is serving his first full term in the Pennsylvania Senate. Joe is a lifelong resident of Indiana County, and represents the 41st Senatorial District in Armstrong, Indiana, Jefferson and Westmoreland counties.
As leader of the Senate Republican Caucus, Joe works with his colleagues to ensure the rights of Pennsylvania citizens remain safeguarded. He has been a champion for advancing legislative initiatives to create jobs, implement infrastructure improvements, support law enforcement and limit government overreach.
Prior to being elected by his colleagues to serve as majority leader in 2022, Joe served as chairman of the Senate Urban Affairs and Housing Committee, vice chairman of the Senate Environmental Resources & Energy Committee, and as a member of the Appropriations, Banking & Insurance, Consumer Protection & Professional Licensure, and Judiciary committees. He was also a member of the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST) Board of Directors.
Thanks in large part to his parents John and Mary Ann (Yevchak), Joe learned the importance of service and civic leadership at a young age. He has carried on the enduring tradition of working to better his community by serving as a past board member of the United Way of Indiana and as a member of the Purchase Line Red Dragon Foundation. Joe is also a life-member of the NRA, as well as a member of the Indiana County Republican Committee, Ford City Sportsmen’s Association and the Indiana-Franklin Lodge #313.
Prior to joining the Senate, Joe served as former Sen. Don White’s chief of staff. In that role, he developed strong working relationships with members of the General Assembly, legislative staff and officials across several state agencies.
Joe holds a bachelor’s degree in Political Science from Penn State University.
Joe resides in Indiana County with his wife Gina (DiMaio) and their four children: Joe Jr., Sam, Rosie and Frannie. He and Gina are members of the St. Thomas More University Parish in Indiana.
