David H. Zimmerman, born on April 13, 1956, in Narvon, Pennsylvania, is an American politician and current member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 99th District. He was first elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2014.

Zimmerman was born and raised on a dairy farm in the 99th Legislative District, where he was instilled with the traditional Lancaster County values of hard work, thrift, and community service. Agriculture is the backbone of the 99th District’s economy, and Zimmerman has a long history of working in agri-business. He served as a sales manager for Lancaster County, the sales manager for all of Pennsylvania, and was ultimately promoted to sales manager of seven eastern states, including Pennsylvania, for an international company of 1,100 employees.

Zimmerman has also served on the Lancaster County Agricultural Preservation Board for the past five years. His public service also includes serving on the Lancaster County Transportation Committee and the Lancaster County Planning Commission. In 2005, he was selected by his colleagues to serve as the chairman for the East Earl Township Board of Supervisors. In 2006, he was chosen to serve as the township’s roadmaster. In these positions, Zimmerman worked with the state Department of Environmental Protection, the Conservation District, and the state Department of Transportation. He built an understanding of complex state regulations that can hold back economic growth.

Zimmerman worked with his colleagues and members of the Lancaster County delegation to the General Assembly to deliver services and critical infrastructure while maintaining his fiscal responsibility to his community – even under tight budgets. His commitment to his community stems from his family and his faith – they are the bedrock on which his public service is built. The 99th District owes its strength to its families and family values, and Zimmerman considers it a high honor to continue serving this community at the state level.

Zimmerman is a lifelong Lancaster County resident and lives in East Earl Township with his wife, Ruth Ann. They have three children and seven grandchildren.
