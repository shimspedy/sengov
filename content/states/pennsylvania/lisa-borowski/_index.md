Lisa’s career in public service began in 2011 when her two sons were still students in Radnor Township School District. She ran for school board and won. She later served as vice president of the board and led the way on creating one of the area’s first full-day kindergarten programs. Public education is a passion of hers and will always be a priority along with gun safety, health care access and affordability, and support for first responders.

Lisa later ran for township commissioner and was elected president of the board of commissioners. She led efforts to secure critical investments for the public library, increase police funding, pave township roads, improve stormwater management, and pass four balanced budgets.

She is a member of several committees and caucuses including the Aging & Older Adult Services Committee, Consumer Protection, Technology & Utilities, Health, Local Government, Veterans Affairs & Emergency Preparedness, Southeast Delegation (Vice Chair), Arts & Culture Caucus, Blue-Green Caucus, Climate Caucus, Community College Caucus, Emerging Technologies Caucus, Irish-American Caucus, Italian-American Caucus, Jewish Legislative Caucus, LGBTQ Equality Caucus, Mental Health Caucus, PA Black Maternal Health Caucus, PA Community Pharmacy Caucus, PA SAFE Caucus, Pennsylvania Charitable Nonprofit Caucus, Polish & Slavic American Caucus, Pre-K Caucus, and Women’s Health Caucus.

Born circa 1966 in Delaware County, Pennsylvania as Lisa Anne Cianciulli, Lisa A. Borowski is a daughter of Francis D. Cianciulli, M.D., and the paternal granddaughter of Daniel R. Cianciulli and Rose Marie (Moccia) Cianciulli. A 1984 graduate of Radnor High School, Lisa Cianciulli earned her Bachelor of Science degree in communications from Drexel University in 1989. She married Mark R. Borowski in September 1994. They are the parents of two sons.

Lisa Borowski worked as a healthcare communications professional for Mercy Health System and Einstein Healthcare Network, and also served as board operations manager for the Philadelphia Police Foundation. As an elected official, she served as a Radnor Township commissioner (2018-2022) and school board member (2011-2015).
