Leslie Baum Rossi is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 59th district. She was elected in a special election held in May 2021 and assumed office the following month. Leslie Rossi is the first woman to represent the 59th district.

Rossi has lived in Unity Township in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, her entire life. She graduated from Derry Area High School in 1988. In 2021, Rossi was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 59th district, which includes part of Westmoreland County and Somerset County. She defeated Democratic candidate Mariah Fisher and Libertarian candidate Robb Luther with 65% of the vote in the special election on May 18, 2021, which was held due to Republican Mike Reese's death in January.

Rossi has eight children with her husband Mike. She is a member of the Republican party. Her committee assignments include Children & Youth, Finance, Gaming Oversight, and Urban Affairs.

Before her political career, Rossi was a small business owner and real estate developer with a proven track record of success in creating jobs and balancing budgets for more than two decades. She has been fighting every day in the Legislature to reverse the excessive government overreach, economy-collapsing policies and unchecked executive power that have shuttered far too many family-sustaining businesses, and resulted in what the Department of Labor and Industry has publicized as 500,000 permanent job losses.
