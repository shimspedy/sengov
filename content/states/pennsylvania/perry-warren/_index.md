Perry S. Warren, Jr. is the state representative for the 31st Legislative District in Pennsylvania. This district includes Lower Makefield Township, Newtown Borough, Newtown Township, Upper Makefield Township, and Yardley Borough. Perry was first elected to the General Assembly in 2016.

As a state representative, Perry serves on several committees including Insurance, Judiciary, Commerce, Transportation, and Government Oversight. He has previously served on the Environmental Resources and Energy, Human Services, and Local Government committees.

Perry has been instrumental in introducing and passing significant legislation. He wrote and originally introduced the bill that became Act 18 of 2020, which ended child marriage in Pennsylvania and provided for remote marriage licenses during the Covid-19 crisis. He also wrote and introduced the bill that became Act 21 of 2020, which permitted licensed restaurants and hotels to sell takeout beverages during the Covid-19 crisis and clarified the procedure for a municipal liquor law referendum.

Perry is a leader in gun safety legislation, and has introduced universal background check, safe storage, lost and stolen, and no fly/no buy gun safety legislation. Along with Rep. Tina Davis, Perry introduced Kayden’s Law, which would ensure that the best interest of the child is the top priority in child custody proceedings.

Among other bills authored and introduced by Rep. Warren are legislation that would reduce plastic water bottle waste and encourage the use of refillable water bottles; reduce flood insurance costs and mitigate the impact of floods; support products “Made in PA”; reduce commuter toll costs; allow adrenal insufficiency medical attention in schools; and provide greater transparency in campaign expense reporting.

Before his tenure in the General Assembly, Perry was elected to Newtown Borough Council in 2009 and was re-elected in 2013. During his seven years on Newtown Borough Council, he was recognized as a "bridge builder," committed to bringing members of both political parties together to forge workable solutions to serve the community. He was instrumental in reviving the Borough's Environmental Advisory Council. He helped write the Borough's non-discrimination ordinance, which outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and he supported the Newtown Common Open Space Project. In addition, Perry served on and acted as a liaison to numerous committees, including the Police Committee, the Environmental Advisory Council, and the Shade Tree Commission.

Perry worked strenuously throughout his tenure on Borough Council to support good governance and responsible stewardship of financial and environmental resources. He brought that experience and perspective to Harrisburg, working with a rural Republican representative and an urban Democratic senator in passing the bill ending child marriage, cosponsoring and advocating for a state non-discrimination law, advocating for state grants to fund improvements, programs and organizations in our communities, and introducing and supporting legislation that preserves and protects the environment and maintains and improves quality of life in the 31st District and beyond.
