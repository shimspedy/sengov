Joanna E. McClinton, born on August 19, 1982, is an American politician from Pennsylvania. She is currently serving as the 143rd Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since February 28, 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, she is the first woman and woman of color to serve as Speaker.

She previously served as Majority Leader from December 1, 2022 to February 28, 2023 and Minority Leader from December 2020 to December 2022. She has served as the representative from the 191st district representing Delaware County and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania since 2015.

McClinton was born and raised in Southwest Philadelphia. She points to an internship with WDAS radio as sparking her passion for public service. McClinton received her Bachelor's of Arts in Political Science from La Salle University. She earned her J.D. from Villanova University. During her enrollment at Villanova School of Law, McClinton interned at the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office as well as the Defender Association of Philadelphia.

Upon graduation, McClinton went on to work for seven years as an assistant public defender. She was eventually named assistant chief of the East Zone. In 2013, McClinton was named Chief Counsel to State Senator Anthony Hardy Williams of the 8th district.

McClinton's volunteer work includes acting as a board member of La Salle University's Alumni Association board of directors and president of La Salle University's African American Alumni Association, acting as a youth minister for ten years, volunteering at the Outreach to Youth and Hand of Compassion American Sign Language Ministry, and serving as secretary to Philadelphia Barrister's Association.

McClinton started her first term in the state legislature after she won a special election for Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2015, winning 70% of the vote and beating Republican Charles Wilkins. The special election was held following Ronald Waters' resignation on June 1, 2015 after he pled guilty to cash payments from lobbyists and sentenced to 23 months probation. She then went on to win reelection in 2016, and was named secretary/treasurer of the Philadelphia County Delegation alongside Maria Donatucci and Jason Dawkins.
