Torren C. Ecker, born on September 2, 1985, is a Pennsylvania politician and the Representative for the 193rd District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He assumed office on January 1, 2019, succeeding Will Tallman. He is a member of the Republican party and resides in Hamilton Township.

Ecker is an alumnus of George Mason University, where he earned his Bachelor's degree, and Western Michigan University, where he received his Juris Doctor degree. He is a practicing attorney at a Hanover-based law firm. In addition to his legal career, Ecker is involved with the East Berlin Community Center, the Hanover Chamber of Commerce, and the Rotary Club.

Before his political career in Pennsylvania, Ecker worked as a legislative aid to Republican Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis in Virginia's 1st congressional district. As a self-described conservative, Ecker promised to bring his fiscal responsibility to Harrisburg to protect the hardworking families of the district during his first campaign. He is a supporter of Second Amendment rights and believes that these rights can be balanced when addressing issues like school safety.

Ecker has stated that the school funding formula in Pennsylvania is inequitable and should be changed, and that the Commonwealth needs to increase funding for vocational programs and apprenticeships as a means of workforce development. He has also suggested that the public schoolteacher pension system needs to be reformed.

In 2018, Ecker campaigned on stopping Tom Wolf's "Liberal Agenda" and "Massive Tax Increases," but expressed gratitude that the Governor has supported increasing funding for apprenticeship programs. During the 2019-2020 Legislative session, Ecker was placed on the Children and Youth, Game and Fisheries, Labor and Industry, Veteran Affairs and Emergency Preparedness, and Judiciary committees.

During the 2019 Coronavirus pandemic, Ecker voted in favor of a bill that would terminate Governor Wolf's declaration of emergency, which served as the legal authority for much of the official response to the pandemic. Ecker did not co-sponsor a resolution from Daryl Metcalfe that would have initiated impeachment proceedings against Governor Wolf for his response to the Coronavirus pandemic.

In the 2018 election, after Will Tallman announced he would not run for re-election, four candidates entered the Republican Primary in the 193rd District. Torren Ecker won the May 15th Primary by a one-vote margin over Barry Cockley, John Wardle, and Andrew Myers, receiving a total of 1,784 votes.
