Darisha K. Parker, born in 1975, is an American politician who is currently serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 198th district. She was elected to this position in November 2020 and assumed office on December 1, 2020.

A native of Northwest Philadelphia, Parker has a deep understanding of the issues that matter most to the people and families in the 198th legislative district. She has been an active member of her local Town Watch and has spearheaded her own grassroots initiatives to protect her communities from violence and help victims of these senseless acts. One of her notable efforts led to the secure return of an abducted woman from Germantown.

Parker's priorities include enacting criminal justice reforms, giving a voice to seniors, preserving parks and recreation centers, and providing affordable healthcare to all Pennsylvanians. She is also a Vice Chair of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus and a member of the Mental Health Caucus, PA Black Maternal Health Caucus, and PA SAFE Caucus.

Before her political career, Parker graduated from Lankenau Environmental Science Magnet High School and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bennett College. She worked as a legislative assistant for Rosita Youngblood, whom she succeeded in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. She also served as the director of media relations with Ross Associates, Inc.

Throughout her career, Parker has shown a commitment to serving her community and working towards a better future for all Pennsylvanians.
