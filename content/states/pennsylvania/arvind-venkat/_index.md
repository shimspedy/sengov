Arvind Venkat, an emergency physician, was elected to serve his first term in the state House of Representatives in November 2022. He is the first Indian American to be elected to the state House and the first physician to serve in the General Assembly in nearly 60 years. He serves as State Representative for the 30th Legislative District, which includes part of Hampton Township, and all of McCandless, Franklin Park, Ohio Township, Emsworth, Ben Avon, Ben Avon Heights, and Kilbuck.

Rep. Venkat is a fighter for accessible and affordable healthcare, investing in our first responders, protecting reproductive rights, curbing gun violence, expanding access to the ballot box for all voters, and getting more people back into the workforce. His parents immigrated to the United States, and it was their hard work and commitment to service that inspired him to become a physician.

Rep. Venkat completed his undergraduate and graduate education at Harvard University, his medical education at Yale University, and his emergency medicine residency at the University of Cincinnati/University Hospital. He served as a member of the Board of the McCandless-Franklin Park Ambulance Authority and is a former president of the state emergency physicians organization.

Arvind Venkat was born on June 6, 1974, in Madurai, India, and raised in Detroit, Michigan by Indian immigrant parents. He attended Detroit Country Day School for high school, graduating in 1992. Venkat graduated from Harvard University in 1996 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Science and a Master of Arts degree in History of Science. He then attended Yale School of Medicine where he graduated with a medical degree in 2000.

Venkat completed his residency in emergency medicine at the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center in 2004. Venkat is an emergency physician affiliated with Allegheny Health Network, which includes Allegheny General Hospital as its flagship hospital. He also is a professor of emergency medicine at Drexel University College of Medicine. From 2019 to 2020, Venkat served as president of the Pennsylvania chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), and in 2020, he was elected to the board of ACEP.

Rep. Venkat currently lives in McCandless with his wife and three children.
