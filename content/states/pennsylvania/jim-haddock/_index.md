Alec Joseph Ryncavage, born on March 27, 2001, is an American businessman and politician. He is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 119th District since 2023.

Ryncavage was born in Pennsylvania to Danielle and David Ryncavage, Sr. He was raised Catholic. While still in junior high school, Ryncavage became a freelance web developer, creating his own anti-virus software at age 14. He later founded his own cybersecurity company, CYBIOT.

Ryncavage graduated from Wyoming Valley West High School in 2019. In the same year, he ran for a seat on the Borough Council of Plymouth, Pennsylvania. His platform included fiscal conservatism and community revitalization. He won, becoming at age 18 the youngest person ever elected to the council.

In 2022, Ryncavage announced his intention to run for Pennsylvania State Representative from the 119th District, to replace retiring State Representative Gerald Mullery. He won the Republican primary election, and went on to defeat Democrat Vito Malacari in the general election. He was the youngest person elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since Michael Cassidy in 1976. At 22 years of age, Ryncavage is the youngest current member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

Ryncavage defines himself as a "moderate Republican" who grew up in a Democratic family in a heavily Democratic hometown. He describes himself as "personally pro-life," but according to himself, has "never supported an outright ban on abortion." He supports exceptions to abortion bans for rape, incest, and protecting the life of the mother. He has indicated support for limiting abortions after 16 to 20 weeks of pregnancy as opposed to Pennsylvania's current limit at 24 weeks. Ryncavage opposes late-term abortions and taxpayer-funded abortions.

On criminal justice and policing, Ryncavage opposes defunding the police. When running for Plymouth Borough Council, he voiced support for stricter code enforcement. During his time on council he advocated for the hiring of more police officers. In 2022, Ryncavage supported the passage of the Officer John Wilding Law, which made it a felony should bodily harm come to a law enforcement officer as a result of a suspect fleeing arrest.

In terms of education, Ryncavage supports school choice and moving state funding to individual students rather than schools to allow for better student access to better, private schools.
