Senator Pat Stefano was elected to represent the 32nd Senatorial District in November 2014.
He is a resident of Fayette County and was a third-generation business owner of his family’s company, Stefano’s Printing. He was part of the family business since the early 1980s before it closed during the pandemic. His skills in managing budgets, controlling costs and meeting a payroll enable him to apply the commonsense and real-world experience much needed in Harrisburg.
Coming from a family whose parents were teachers, he has pledged to focus on students and the classroom and will work to ensure teachers have the tools they need to succeed.
Stefano has been involved with many local chambers and is a past president of the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce. He has worked county-wide, serving as a board member of the Fay-Penn Economic Development Council.
Pat has dedicated himself to numerous charitable and civic causes in the community. He is a lifetime member and former Board President of the American Heart Association, where he has volunteered for more than 30 years. He has also dedicated his time to Junior Achievement, Rotary Club of Connellsville, YMCA of Laurel Highlands, Downtown Connellsville and Boy Scouts Troop 180.
Sen. Stefano serves as chair of the Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure Committee and vice chair of the Transportation Committee. He also serves on the Aging and Youth; Appropriations; Community, Economic and Recreational Development; Health and Human Services, Policy and State Government committees.
Pat and his family, along with three grandchildren, reside in the Fayette/Westmoreland area.
