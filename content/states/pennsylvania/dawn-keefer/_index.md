Dawn Wetzel Keefer, born on October 6, 1972, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, is an American politician currently representing the 92nd District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. She graduated from Gettysburg Area High School in 1991 and earned a BA degree in government and politics from George Mason University in 1995.

Keefer has served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 92nd district, since 2017. She was initially elected in 2016 and won reelection in 2018, 2020, and 2022. Following the 2020 United States presidential election, Keefer supported efforts to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania, advocating for an audit of the election. She was one of 26 Pennsylvania House Republicans who signed a letter requesting the disqualification of Pennsylvania's electoral votes.

Keefer is the inaugural chairwoman of the Pennsylvania State Freedom Caucus. Under her leadership, the caucus called for Pennsylvania libraries to withdraw from the American Library Association after its president, Emily Drabinski, referred to herself as a "Marxist" in a social media post. The caucus also sued the administration of Governor Josh Shapiro in 2024 after Shapiro implemented automatic voter registration in the state, claiming it to be executive overreach.

On January 11, 2024, Keefer announced her candidacy for the Pennsylvania State Senate in the 31st district following the retirement of Mike Regan. Keefer is frequently described as a small government conservative due to her efforts to cut back and restrict government spending. She was recognized by the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) for her high score on their Award for Conservative Excellence.

Keefer's husband is Tom. They have three children and live in Dillsburg, Pennsylvania.
