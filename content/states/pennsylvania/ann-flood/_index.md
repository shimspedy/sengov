Ann Flood is an American politician and a member of the Republican party. She represents the 138th district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, a position she has held since January 5, 2021. She succeeded Marcia Hahn in this role.

Born in Wind Gap, Pennsylvania, Ann currently resides in Bath with her husband, Daniel. They have a son named Jake, a daughter named Ella, and their late daughter, Lauren. Lauren's Hope Foundation, which Ann built from the ground up, is named in honor of Lauren.

Ann graduated from Pen Argyl High School and later received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Moravian College. She also studied chemistry and psychology during her time at Moravian College.

In 2020, Ann was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 138th district, which is part of Northampton County. She won the general election by defeating Democratic candidate Tara Zrinski with 56.2% of the vote.

Ann Flood is known for her dedication to helping others, which is evident in her work as a state representative. She has firsthand experience working and collaborating with health professionals, patients, business owners, and job creators to enhance the local economy. She is committed to promoting policies that protect workers and enable employers to sustain and grow their business operations.

In the realm of education, Ann is focused on securing funding for Pennsylvania’s schools, colleges, universities, trade programs, and other educational institutions. Her goal is to provide every student with the best opportunities for learning and success.

In terms of health care, she is committed to implementing measures that will stabilize health care costs, making it more affordable, and expanding access to mental health services.

For the 2023-24 Legislative Session, Ann has been appointed to serve on the Appropriations Committee, Labor and Industry Committee, Liquor Control Committee, and Aging and Older Adult Services committee. She also serves as Deputy Chair on Tourism for the Policy Committee and is a member of the Governor’s Advisory Commission on Women.

Before joining the Legislature, Ann started Lauren’s Hope Foundation to enhance the quality of life for brain-injured children and offer support for their families. The foundation was started in 2008 in memory of her daughter, Lauren, who passed away in 2007 as a result of a brain injury sustained at birth. The foundation has helped fund hypothermia therapy equipment to support a cutting-edge treatment program at the Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. It has also helped families pay for treatments that weren’t covered by insurance and provided specialized equipment that enabled children to remain at home with their families rather than forcing them to live in a residential nursing facility.
