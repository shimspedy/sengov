Steven R. "Steve" Malagari was born on October 17, 1983, in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, U.S. He is an American politician serving as a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 53rd district. He has held the position since January 1, 2019.

Malagari's political career began in 2012 when he was elected to the Lansdale Borough Council. He served in this position until he was elected to the House in 2018. Malagari also served on the Montgomery County Transportation Authority starting in 2013. In 2018, Malagari beat fellow Lansdale Borough Councilman Leon Angelichio for the Democratic nomination. He then challenged Republican Andy Szekely and Libertarian John Waldenberger for the seat left vacant by Representative Bob Godshall and ultimately won the election on November 6, 2018, becoming the first Democrat to hold the seat since 1972.

In terms of education, Malagari is a graduate of North Penn High School. He later pursued higher education at Ursinus College where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology and German.

On the personal front, Malagari lives in Lansdale with his wife, Rachel. He is a true native son of his district. Born in Hatfield, raised in Lansdale, he has lived in the district his whole life. He was a student-athlete, an Eagle Scout, and a North Penn High graduate. He grew up with many of his constituents and now he’s serving this same community in Harrisburg.

Before his political career, Malagari worked at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in a clinical laboratory for several years, and then transitioned careers into sales. A former local beverage seller, Steve is an impassioned advocate for working and middle-class families.
