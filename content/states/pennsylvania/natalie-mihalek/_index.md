Natalie Nicole Mihalek is an American politician and a member of the Republican party. She represents District 40 in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

Born in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, Mihalek's commitment to public service began early. She was a member of the Girl Scouts of America (GSA), where she received the GSA Gold Award, Scouting’s highest achievement.

After graduating from South Allegheny High School, she enlisted in the U.S. Navy, where she qualified and served in the Navy’s elite nuclear power program, of which only 1 percent of the sailors admitted are women.

Mihalek served in the United States Navy from 1997 to 2000. Afterwards, she returned to Allegheny County where she attended the University of Pittsburgh, earning a Bachelor's degree in 2004 and a JD from the Appalachian School of Law in 2007.

She worked as an Assistant District Attorney in Allegheny County from 2007 to 2010, where she worked closely with crime victims and police to prosecute criminal cases and put violent offenders behind bars.

In addition to her work in criminal justice, Mihalek also owned a successful small business in Upper St. Clair and was working for a large financial institution at the time of her election.

In 2018, Mihalek ran for election to represent District 40 in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, which includes Bethel Park, McMurray, and Upper Saint Clair. The incumbent, John A. Maher, decided not to seek reelection. She won a three-way Republican primary with 46.7% of the vote, and went on to win the general election with 56.1% of the vote. She was re-elected in 2020.

As a state representative, working mother and military veteran, Mihalek said she will be a voice for the thousands of brave men and women who serve or have served this great nation. She aims to fight to end the opioid epidemic; protect citizens from out-of-control taxes and job-killing government regulation; and ensure the kind of future that will give today’s children and future generations a reason to stay here and raise their own families.

For the 2023-24 Legislative Session, she serves on the House Consumer Protection, Technology and Utilities Committee and the Insurance Committee, of which she serves as the Republican Vice Chair. She is also a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

Mihalek and her husband, Jeremy, reside in Peters Township with their three young children.
