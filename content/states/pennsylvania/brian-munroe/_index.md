Brian Munroe is a dedicated public servant who has served in various roles throughout his life. Born on January 25, 1974, Brian's journey of public service began at the tender age of 17 when he became a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician. His commitment to service led him to enlist in the United States Navy three years later, where he served aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt. His naval career was decorated with numerous awards including the Armed Forces medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the National America Treaty Organization Medal.

After his Naval service, Brian pursued a career in law enforcement and became a police officer in Radnor Township in 2001. During his tenure as a police officer, Brian attained the rank of corporal and received commendations from the United States Congress and Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

The experience Brian gained through his Naval service and law enforcement service allowed him the opportunity to serve his community by running for public office. He was elected to a seat on the Warminster Township Board of Supervisors, where he focused on open space, green development, and aligning the structure, staffing, and training of the police department with the safety needs of the community.

Prior to being elected to represent the 144th Legislative District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Brian served as Clerk of Courts for Buck County. Brian’s legislative focuses include protecting and expanding the right of bodily autonomy for women, including reproductive rights. He is also an environmental champion and will work tirelessly to ensure that every Pennsylvanian’s right to clean air and water is protected under the law.

Health care, including expanding high-quality, affordable mental health services, is a chief priority of Brian’s. As a cancer survivor, Brian understands the inequities in our health care system and will be a zealous advocate for accessible and affordable health care.

Brian views education, the economy, and jobs as being intricate, crucial pieces to a thriving society where everyone, regardless of race, sexuality, gender, religion, or creed, must have a fair opportunity to make a living wage and support their families. Brian will use his platform as state representative to propel initiatives that level the playing field, while simultaneously reducing the financial strain on family budgets through commonsense proposals that decrease the cost of living.

Brian has lived in Warminster for the past 18 years with his wife, Natalie, a writer; their two daughters, Lily and Anna; and three pets.
