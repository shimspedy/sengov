Wendy Fink is an American politician who was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as a Republican to represent the 94th district. She assumed office on January 3, 2023, succeeding Stan Saylor.

Personal Details:
Wendy Fink is a lifelong resident of York County. She attended the Red Lion High School, graduating in 1995. She graduated from Millersville University with a bachelor's degree in Elementary and Early Childhood Education. She worked as a substitute teacher for the Red Lion Area School District until 1997, after which she was a stay-at-home mom for 16 years. She returned to teaching in 2020 at Grace Academy (a private school in York). She homeschools her children. She lives with her husband and three of her four children in Windsor Township.

Political Career:
Fink defeated incumbent Representative Stan Saylor, who had been in office for 15 terms, in the Republican primaries for the 2022 Pennsylvania House of Representatives election. She was unopposed in the general election. She has generally been described as further right-wing than Saylor due to running on an anti-establishment platform against career politicians. Her defeat of Saylor, and Joe D'Orsie 's defeat of Keith J. Gillespie, another career politician defeated in the primary, resulted in the resignation of Chairman of the York County Republican Committee, Jeff Piccola. Fink opened her district office in Red Lion.
