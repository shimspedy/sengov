Dallas Paul Kephart is an American politician and attorney who currently represents the 73rd District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as a Republican since 2023.

Born around 1996, Kephart was raised in Decatur Township in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Phillipsburg-Osceola High School in 2014. Following high school, Kephart pursued higher education at Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 2018, graduating magna cum laude.

While earning his undergraduate degree, Kephart interned for Congressman Glenn Thompson and worked as a coal miner during the summer months. He then went on to earn his Juris Doctor at Penn State Law. During his time at law school, Kephart clerked for the U.S. House Oversight Committee. He finished law school in 2021, and subsequently became a licensed attorney in Pennsylvania, working for a judge on the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.

In 2022, Kephart won the three-way Republican primary to represent the 73rd District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. The seat was open following the retirement of Tommy Sankey, and Kephart faced no opponent in the general election. He assumed office on January 3, 2023. His current term ends on November 30, 2024.
