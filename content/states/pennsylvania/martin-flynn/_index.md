Marty Flynn, born Martin Bradshaw Flynn Jr. on September 18, 1975, is an American politician and a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate. He previously served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and is a member of the Democratic Party.

Flynn was born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Scranton Preparatory School in 1994, where he excelled in baseball, football, and wrestling. He then attended Marywood University, where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Legal Studies.

While at Marywood, Flynn began boxing and eventually embarked upon a decade-long professional career. Upon retiring from the sport, Flynn worked as the Inmate Education and Program Coordinator at Lackawanna County Prison, where he also served as Chairman of the Prison Misconduct Board.

Flynn entered the world of government in 2013, when he was elected to serve the 113th District of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, a role he had for more than eight years. On June 9, 2021, he began a new chapter in his political career when he was sworn in as Senator of Pennsylvania’s 22nd Senatorial District.

In the Senate, Flynn is a member of the Consumer Protection & Professional Licensure Committee, Labor & Industry Committee, Law & Justice Committee, and is the Democratic Chair of the Transportation Committee. Since being in this role, Senator Flynn has been the leader in holding the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission accountable for more than $150 million in uncollected Turnpike tolls.
