Jim Rigby is an American politician serving as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 71st district since 2019.

Born as James Patrick Rigby, he has had a diverse career before entering politics. Rigby graduated from Ferndale Area High School and attended the police academy at the Greater Johnstown Career and Technology Center. After volunteering as a firefighter, he worked as a police officer and was named chief of police in Ferndale in 2015.

In addition to his service in law enforcement, Rigby also served on the Ferndale Borough Council for 24 years, including 6 years as the council president. His dedication to public service is evident in his long-standing commitment to his local community.

In 2018, Rigby decided to take his public service to a higher level and ran for a seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives representing the 71st district, which includes parts of Cambria County and Somerset County. He defeated incumbent Democratic representative Bryan Barbin in the general election with 52% of the vote.

Rigby ran for reelection in 2020 and did not have an opponent in the general election. As a representative, Rigby currently sits on several committees, including the Government Oversight, Judiciary, Liquor Control, Local Government, Subcommittee on Boroughs committees, and Veterans Affairs & Emergency Preparedness.

On a personal note, Rigby is married to Kathleen and they have three children. His personal and professional life reflects his dedication to public service and commitment to his constituents.
