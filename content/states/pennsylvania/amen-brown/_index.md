Amen Brown, born around 1987, is an American politician currently serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He represents the 10th District since 2023, having previously represented the 190th District from 2021 to 2022 before redistricting moved him to the 10th District.

Born and raised in West Philadelphia, Brown grew up in a single-parent household with his eight siblings. His mother was addicted to drugs and his father was incarcerated. At age 12, he was shot in the back near his family home at 56th and Market, a bullet fragment would remain lodged between his ribs into his adult life. In high school, Brown was arrested during a police raid at a corner store and was in jail for 45 days before the charges of felony drug-dealing were dropped.

After graduating from Overbrook High School in 2006, he attended the Community College of Philadelphia with the intention of becoming a school principal. However, he left college early to pursue his business career. At age 22, Brown co-founded the Education Nation Learning Academy, a child care facility in Frankford. A few years later, he opened a second facility. Brown left the partnership and founded the Overbrook Beacon Community Center in Overbrook. He has also worked as the coordinator for the University of Pennsylvania Sayre Community School Beacon.

In March 2019, Brown ran in the special election held to fill the 190th state house seat vacated after Vanessa L. Brown resigned. He ran as a member of the Amen Brown Party and won 20% of the vote in a four-way race, losing to Democrat Movita Johnson-Harrell. In June 2020, Brown ran as a Democrat, defeating incumbent G. Roni Green in the Democratic primary, winning by just 600 votes. He campaigned during the COVID-19 pandemic by delivering masks and hand sanitizer.

Brown was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in November 2020, winning 95% of the vote and defeating Republican Wanda Logan. Following redistricting in 2021, Brown successfully ran for the 10th District seat in 2022. This was despite an attempt to have Brown removed from the primary ballot after it was revealed Brown failed to properly fill out a required list of financial interests. Brown's name was allowed to remain on the ballot, though a judge did chastise Brown for displaying “an ignorance and shocking lack of care of the law.”
