Russell H. Diamond, born on July 26, 1963, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, is an American politician and businessman. He is a member of the Republican Party and has been serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 102nd district since January 6, 2015.

Before his political career, Diamond owned Raintree Multimedia, a CD and DVD duplication company based in Annville, and was later an over-the-road truck driver employed by Millis Transfer Inc. He describes himself as a conservative Republican and his political career has coincided with a shift in the Pennsylvania Republican Party further to the right wing.

In 2005, after the state legislature voted itself a pay raise, Diamond created PACleanSweep.com, a Web-based political action committee dedicated to ousting every incumbent legislator in the state. The anti-incumbency movement played a role in the ouster of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice and in the defeat of 17 incumbent state legislators in primary elections.

Between 2004 and 2014, Diamond launched six failed campaigns for elected office. In 2004, he ran simultaneously for the U.S. House of Representatives (from the Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district) and the state house (for the 101st Legislative District) as a Libertarian Party candidate. He was defeated in both races. In 2006, Diamond launched an independent campaign for governor. Diamond abandoned his run when he fell well short of the signature requirements to qualify for the ballot.

In 2008, Diamond challenged Republican incumbent Gingrich for the 101st district seat in the Pennsylvania state House. The campaign was acrimonious, with Gingrich calling Diamond unfit for office over comments he made regarding police.

Diamond continues his efforts now in the General Assembly to increase transparency and root out waste, fraud, and abuse in government. A small business owner, Russ knows firsthand the struggle that entrepreneurs face when trying to grow and expand. That’s why he continues to fight to ease the tax burden on Pennsylvanians and remove unnecessary regulations that stand in the way of job creation. Putting people back to work is one of his top legislative goals.

Pennsylvania’s outdated system of property taxation unduly burdens seniors, making it impossible for many to afford to keep their homes. Russ is fighting to eliminate property taxes, a move that would increase access to home ownership and spark economic growth. Diamond also supports overhauling the Commonwealth’s two statewide pension systems to reduce the state’s debt burden and keep Pennsylvania solvent for our children’s future.

In the 2023-24 Legislative Session, Russ has been appointed Republican Chair of the Gaming Oversight Committee. In his spare time, Russ Diamond is an author and private pilot. He currently lives in Annville in a home built by his great-grandparents.
