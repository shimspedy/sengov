Jonathan Fritz, born on November 30, 1976, is an American politician who has been serving in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 111th district since 2017. His constituency includes parts of Wayne County and Susquehanna County.

Fritz's political career began when he was elected to represent the 111th Legislative District in November 2016. He has been appointed to several committees for the 2023-24 legislative session, including Finance, Gaming Oversight, and Insurance.

Before his tenure in the House of Representatives, Fritz served two terms as mayor of Honesdale and two terms as a Wayne County commissioner, serving as vice chair. As mayor, Fritz dedicated himself to improving the quality of life in his community. He furthered initiatives to prevent drug dealing and drug abuse, battled absentee landlords, and focused on removing blight while working to strengthen public safety, improve traffic flow, and expand business and cultural opportunities.

In his role as county commissioner, Fritz and his fellow commissioners worked hard to prevent tax increases and regulations from stifling families and local businesses. Fritz is a product of the private business sector. For many years he was general manager and head of sales for a local tractor and farm machinery dealership, rising to rank in the top 1 percent of salesmen for New Holland North America, Ag Tractor Division.

Fritz earned a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from Pennsylvania State University. Contributing to a successful 2019-20 legislative session, Fritz sponsored three important pieces of legislation that aided in eliminating outdated government boards and commissions, benefited the energy industry and supported family-sustaining job creation, and honored a local fallen Vietnam veteran.

His legislative priorities include supporting small business growth, enhancing the state’s energy industry, strengthening area emergency response organizations, and protecting local economies from environmental over-regulation. Fritz lives in Honesdale with his wife, Donna, and their three children.
