Camera Bartolotta is an American politician and a member of the Republican party. She is currently the Pennsylvania state Senator for the 46th district. Born on December 4, 1963, she brings an entrepreneurial spirit and a wealth of real-world experience to her job representing residents of Beaver, Greene, and Washington counties.

A longtime resident of Monongahela, she was elected to her first term representing the 46th Senatorial District in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018 and 2022. In doing so, she became the first Republican to represent the 46th district in 38 years, and the first ever woman.

Prior to being elected to the Senate in the 2014 election, she opened the first quick-lube business in the Mon Valley, Duke of Oil, and also produced “La Dolce Vita,” a cooking show that aired on WPXI-TV and PCNC. She serves on the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, Pittsburgh Film Office board of trustees, the Pittsburgh Ballet board of trustees, the University of Pittsburgh Institute of Politics board of fellows, and the Pennsylvania Prison Society board.

During her time in the Senate, Camera has authored many new laws, including measures to help judges keep the most dangerous domestic violence offenders behind bars; relocate victims of domestic violence who live in public housing; improve the availability of job training programs throughout the state; ease strain on farmers and food supply; provide additional resources to support fire and EMS companies impacted by COVID-19; preserve access to ventilator and tracheostomy care by dedicating additional Medicaid funding; protect Pennsylvania’s fresh water supplies by ensuring the safe use of treated mine water in oil and gas operations; authorize the operation of Transportation Network Companies like Uber and Lyft in all 67 counties; strengthen penalties for motorists who injure workers and emergency responders in construction zones; and strengthen and improve the state’s School Bus Stop Arm Camera Law.

She also introduced a proposed amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution to limit the future growth in state government spending and protect taxpayers. Camera also led efforts in the Senate to help more Pennsylvanians benefit from the state’s Clean Slate law and allow homeless individuals to receive free photo identification – breaking down major barriers to employment and financial independence.

In the Senate, Camera’s committee assignments reflect the main concerns of the communities she represents, including the need for quality, family-sustaining jobs and smaller government. She currently serves as vice chair of the Senate Labor and Industry Committee, which is responsible for considering a wide range of issues pertaining to both employers and employees, including Worker’s Compensation, Unemployment Compensation, workplace safety, building codes and workforce development.

Through her committee involvement, she led the Senate’s efforts to hold the Wolf Administration accountable for flaws in the state’s Unemployment Compensation system that led to delayed payments to hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians during the COVID-19 pandemic. She also serves as a member of the Senate Judiciary, Rules and Executive Nominations, Transportation and Veterans Affairs and Emergency Preparedness committees.

Camera also co-chairs the Senate Gas and Oil Caucus, a bipartisan legislative body that focuses on issues impacting the gas and oil industry with the goal of promoting policies resulting in a positive future for constituents, the business community and state economy. She also co-founded the bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform Caucus to focus on ways to help promote safer communities, reduce prison costs, reduce recidivism and ensure better outcomes for individuals who are part of the criminal justice system.
