Nancy Guenst is an American politician serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 152nd district. She was elected to represent the 152nd Legislative District in November 2020. Born and raised in Hatboro, she was the youngest of five children in a working-class family where she says her mother taught her the importance of giving back to her community. Her mother was her first role model, teaching her the value of hard work, the importance of fighting for what you believe, the responsibility of giving to those less fortunate and the power of compassion.

Everyday Nancy went with her mother to neighbors' houses, or the local orphanage, to bring all the leftover food from the family’s deli shop to kids that were in need. Nancy pursued her undergraduate education at Montgomery County Community College and the Defense Language Institute. In 1976, she joined the Army and served from 1977 to 1979 as an analyst and German translator at Field Station Berlin. She has extensive training in emergency management, and the safety of Commonwealth residents is a major concern to her.

As a veteran, she understands the challenges that veterans face in life after service and will fight to protect Pennsylvania’s veterans and secure more funding for their health care and benefits. From 2007-2017 she served Hatboro as a councilwoman, chairing the Parks and Recreation committee in addition to serving as the council’s vice-president during her last two years. In 2010 while a member of borough council, Nancy introduced the Human Relations Ordinance, which was approved by council but vetoed by the mayor.

In 2017 she decided to run for mayor and the ordinance was eventually passed again and she signed it. Now Hatboro prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or both, race, religion or disability. She is a former board member of the Union Library of Hatboro, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Hatboro Rotary. Nancy also served as the treasurer for Elm Street, Hatboro’s revitalization board. As treasurer, she oversaw the private funding and construction of the new Tanner Park Playground, a significant achievement that came at no expense to Hatboro taxpayers.

She and her husband of 25 years Steve have one son, Alexander. Rep. Nancy Guenst continues to serve the 152nd Legislative District.
