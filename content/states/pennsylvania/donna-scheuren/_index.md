Donna Scheuren is an American politician who currently serves as the Republican Representative to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives's 147th district. She was sworn in on January 3rd, 2023.

Born in New Jersey, Donna attended the Cherokee High School in Marlton, New Jersey, graduating in 1987. She then attended The College of New Jersey, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration as part of their class of 1991.

Prior to her election, she worked as a Manufacturer's Representative. She moved to Lower Salford Township in 1996, shortly after marrying her husband, Dave Scheuren, who personally built their house.

Donna first became involved in politics when she became a member of the Souderton Area School Board and served for three terms. She was also the Township supervisor for Lower Salford Township, and served on their sewer authority.

She ran for House on a pro-Business and pro-Constitution platform advocating government deregulation, lowering of taxes, and building jobs. She defeated Democrat, Alexandra Wisser, a homemaker, in the general election. There were serious doubts if the Republican party could hold onto the 147th district, due to it being rezoned to include more Democratic neighborhoods. Despite this, Scheuren defeated Wisser with 17,667 votes to 14,626.

As a businesswoman, manufacturer’s representative and vice president serving in the industrial commodities and manufacturing sector for nearly 30 years, Donna has engaged with businesses here in the United States and abroad for years. With a focus on winning manufacturing contracts for her principles, she has helped to keep thousands of people employed. She has also been a proud small business owner, as well as an administrator overseeing the health and benefits of her family’s construction company.

She serves on the House Transportation, Professional Licensure, and Commerce Committees. In Commerce, she is the Republican Chair of the Subcommittee on Automation and Technology. With a strong business background, Donna understands the needs of job creators and the importance of common-sense solutions to remove burdensome regulations currently hindering small businesses.

With inflation and high gas prices affecting the working class, struggling families and seniors on fixed incomes, Donna knows reducing taxes and investing in infrastructure is a must to bring about energy independence. Having a strong work ethic herself, she’d emphasize investment in the trades and more tech schools throughout the state to keep our greatest asset in the Commonwealth – our workforce.

As an advocate for strong and safe communities, she believes in policies that hold criminals accountable for their actions and programs that support local police, fire, and EMS with retention and recruitment services to help them stabilize. As a defender of our Constitution and the principles of our Founding Fathers, Donna is a strong voice for holding government accountable, economic freedom, good schools, election reform, private property rights, advancing prosperity, deregulation, the rule of law, low taxes and the protection of life and liberty.

As a dedicated public servant, Donna has played an active role in the community for 12 years. With three terms of service on the Souderton Area School Board as the board’s vice president and finance chairman, she accentuated board governance, and delivered fiscally-responsible budgets for the taxpayers of her district. Her role in local government expanded into board service on the Montgomery County Intermediate Unit and Legislative Committees, where she interacted with school directors across Montgomery County on educational and social services supporting all 200-plus schools. In 2020, she was also appointed to The Foundations Board of Trustees for Grand View Health, where she serves in the field of finance on GVH’s Investment Committee.
