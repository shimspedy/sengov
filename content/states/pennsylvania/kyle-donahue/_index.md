Kyle T. Donahue is a well-known figure in Lackawanna County, having served as the president of Scranton City Council before being elected as the state representative for the 113th Legislative District in November 2022. During his tenure on the City Council, Donahue worked with past and present administrations, economic recovery experts, and business leaders to help Scranton shed its 30-year-long financially distressed status.

As a state representative, his priority is fair education funding for all school districts. He believes that the state must provide teachers and children with the resources they require while providing property tax relief to senior citizens. He is a strong supporter of universal Pre-K and an expansion of early childhood education.

Donahue also advocates for raising the minimum wage, protecting the Prevailing Wage Act, and supporting small businesses. He believes that every Pennsylvanian deserves affordable, accessible, and quality health care. He stands up against insurance special interests that prioritize profits over providing quality care. He fights to ensure that all women have the right to make health care decisions for themselves.

He works to protect the integrity of elections, enact comprehensive campaign finance reform, end political gerrymandering, and expand ballot access for all Pennsylvanians. Donahue is a member of the St. Patrickâ€™s Parade Association of Lackawanna County and Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of Lackawanna County. He has served as a director of the Scranton School Board, a board member of the Scranton-Lackawanna Human Development Agency, and a board member of Scranton Tomorrow.

Donahue graduated from Bishop Hannan High School and Temple University. He and his wife Mary Kate have two daughters, Maggie and Clare. They also have a goldendoodle named Beau.
