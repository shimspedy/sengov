Aerion Andrew Abney is an American politician who has served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since 2022. A member of the Democratic Party, he represents the 19th district, which contains parts of Pittsburgh. Before his election to the state legislature, Abney was a social worker and community activist involved in local politics.

Abney was born on May 23, 1988, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Cardinal O'Hara High School and then moved to Pittsburgh at the age of 18 to attend the University of Pittsburgh. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications in 2010 and a Master of Social Work degree from the university's School of Social Work in 2012.

Before his political career, Abney was a program officer with the POISE Foundation, a grantmaking institution aimed at empowering Black people across the Pittsburgh region. In this role, he approved more than $1.7 million in grants to local nonprofit organizations. He also served as the Pennsylvania director of special projects for All Voting Is Local, a national organization fighting to remove discriminatory barriers at the ballot box. In this position, he was a fierce advocate for the expansion of voting rights, especially for incarcerated Pennsylvanians.

Abney has been heavily involved in the local community, previously serving as a committeeman for the 21st Ward, 4th District, and currently sitting on the boards of the Hill District Federal Credit Union, the Human Services Center Corp., and the advisory board of the African American Achievement Trust Collective Focus. He is also a member of the My Brotherâ€™s Keeper taskforce in the city of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, and Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc.

He currently resides in Manchester with his wife Tamara and two sons, Aerius and Amari.
