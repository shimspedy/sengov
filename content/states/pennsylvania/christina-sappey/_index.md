Christina Sappey, known to many as Chris, is a longtime resident of Chester County, where she has worked, been an active member of the community, and raised a family. She managed businesses in the fashion industry for many years. Later, as a stay-at-home parent, she became active in open space, natural resource protection, and infrastructure issues in her community.

Upon returning to the workforce, Chris used her knowledge and experience to serve the people of Chester County as chief of staff to former state Rep. Barbara McIlvaine Smith, director of legislative initiatives for former state Sen. Andy Dinniman, and as chief of staff to former state Rep. and now-state Sen. Carolyn Comitta.

As a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since 2019 representing the 158th Legislative District, she is committed to protecting our quality of life and working to create opportunity for all. Her district office, located centrally in the 158th District at the intersection of routes 82 and 926, is available to assist constituents with an array of state-related concerns. She welcomes the opportunity to hear from you.

Representative Sappey is the first woman and first Democrat to represent the 158th Legislative District. The 158th District includes East Fallowfield, East Marlborough, Kennett, New Garden, Newlin, Pocopson, West Bradford, West Marlborough Townships and the boroughs of Avondale and Kennett Square.
