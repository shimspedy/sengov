Joe Hogan is an American politician and a member of the Republican party. He is currently serving as a representative in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 142nd legislative district, a position he assumed on January 3, 2023. He succeeded Frank Farry in this role.

Before his political career, Joe Hogan worked as a program director for The Redevelopment Authority of the County of Bucks (RDA). In this role, he wrote and managed grants, gaining valuable insight into the needs of small businesses, especially during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. His work at the RDA involved securing and distributing more than $1 million in grants and loans to keep local businesses operational. He was also responsible for the administration of millions of dollars in emergency services grants to ensure the safety of communities and preparedness of first responders.

In 2023, Hogan ran for the 142nd PA House seat to replace Frank Farry, who was running for the Pennsylvania State Senate. Hogan won the election by a narrow margin of 76 votes. This victory came after a voting machine was found untabulated in Lower Southampton. The votes in that machine gave Hogan his victory after opponent Mark Moffa was up by two votes after election day.

Joe Hogan is married to Janita Hogan and is an Economic Development Professional by occupation. He received his B.A. and M.P.A. in Community and Economic Development from Pennsylvania State University. He also holds a J.D. from Temple University's Beasley School of Law.
