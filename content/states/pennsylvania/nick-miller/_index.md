Senator Nick Miller is a fifth generation Allentown resident, raised by his mother, a public servant, who instilled upon him the importance of service from a young age. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Penn State University and a Master’s in Public Administration from the University of Pennsylvania. This spirit of service is what inspired Nick to successfully run for the Allentown School Board in 2019, serving as Vice President of the School Board in 2021. Nick is most proud of directing $34 million of the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funding from the American Rescue Plan Act to upgrade some of the district’s oldest buildings, including installing air conditioning in 10 of the district’s schools by 2025, and effectively navigating the school district through the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, Nick climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro to raise more than $20,000 for the Allentown School District Foundation to refurbish the weight rooms at Allen and Dieruff high schools.

A small business owner, Nick understands the need for investment in our local economy. He looks forward to supporting policies that attract new economic opportunities across the 14th District, making it easier for families to make ends meet and keeping more money in Pennsylvanian’s wallets.

In the state Senate, Nick will continue as an unwavering advocate for students, educators, and economic success for families and small businesses in the Lehigh Valley.
