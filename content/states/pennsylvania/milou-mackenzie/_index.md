Mackenzie currently sits on several committees including Children & Youth; Education; Human Services; Housing & Community Development; and Urban Affairs.

Before her political career, Mackenzie owned and operated V.M. Mackenzie Interior Design, LLC for more than 30 years. She also has years of teaching experience in several local school districts and in a private school in Allentown.
