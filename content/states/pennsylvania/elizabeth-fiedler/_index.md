Elizabeth Fiedler is a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 184th Legislative District in Philadelphia. She was elected to the Pennsylvania House on November 8, 2018.

Before her political career, Fiedler was a reporter at public radio station WHYY-FM for a decade, where she covered community affairs and politics. Her commitment to public service and her understanding of the needs of her constituents are deeply rooted in her experiences as a journalist.

Fiedler is the daughter of two union public school teachers and grew up in rural Pennsylvania. She is now raising two young boys on a small block in South Philadelphia. She studied International Relations at Bucknell University, furthering her understanding of global affairs and their impact on local communities.

In her role as a state representative, Fiedler has been a strong advocate for affordable healthcare, supporting legislation on universal healthcare, Medicare and Medicaid expansion, and protecting a woman’s power to make her own choices about her health and her body. She believes in healthcare as a human right and works tirelessly to make this a reality for all Pennsylvanians.

Fiedler also cares deeply about the environment and clean renewable energy. She is committed to creating an economy that supports the needs of regular people, not corporate and special interests. She strives for a democracy and justice system that works fairly for all.

In the Pennsylvania House, Fiedler serves on several committees and caucuses. She is the Education Subcommittee Chair of the Policy Committee, the Subcommittee Chair of the Appropriations Finance Health Rules, and the Subcommittee Chair of the Philadelphia House Delegation. She is also the Co-Chair of the Afterschool Caucus, the Blue-Green Caucus, the Medicare For All Caucus, the Climate Caucus, the LGBTQ Equality Caucus, the PA SAFE Caucus, and the Women’s Health Caucus.

Through her work, Fiedler continues to serve the 184th Legislative District and the people of Pennsylvania, championing the causes that matter most to her constituents.
