Joshua Siegel is an American politician who is a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. A member of the Democratic Party, he represents the 22nd district, which contains parts of Allentown and Salisbury Township.

Siegel was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Seton Hall University in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science degree in international relations and diplomacy. Siegel moved to Allentown in 2016. He worked as a field organizer on a Pennsylvania House of Representatives election in the 183rd district.

Siegel was elected to the Allentown city council on November 5, 2019, at age 25, making him at the time the youngest member ever elected to the body. He served as chair of the Budget and Finance Committee for three years. During Siegel's tenure on the city council, he successfully passed paid family leave for city workers, making Allentown the fifth municipality or political subdivision in Pennsylvania to offer this benefit to their city employees.

Siegel also successfully led the drive to bring the city's vehicle fleet maintenance back in house after over twenty years of privatization, citing concerns over public safety, treatment of union employees, substandard wages and lengthy times required to service critical city vehicles such as fire trucks and snowplows.

Siegel was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2022 to serve the residents of the 22nd Legislative District in Lehigh County. Previously, Siegel also served for two years as the Public Information Officer at Lehigh County, working to enhance and improve communication between the county government and its constituents.

As Public Information Officer, he assisted in the development of Lehigh Countyâ€™s first-ever newsletter and the creation of its Youth Advisory Council, expanding leadership opportunities for area youth. At 25, Siegel was elected to Allentown City Council, becoming the youngest ever city council member and served as the only council member for his residential area of the East Side of Allentown.

He chaired the Budget and Finance Committee for three years, acting as a financial watchdog. On Allentown City Council, Siegel passed paid family leave legislation, making Allentown just the fifth municipality in Pennsylvania to offer six weeks of paid leave to new parents, joining the cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, as well as Allegheny and Philadelphia counties.

Siegel also championed legislation to promote apprenticeships on city public works projected, protect reproductive access and reform campaign finance laws. Siegel was inspired to public service by his father and sister, a gay man and trans woman, whose life experience demonstrated the importance of dedicated public servants committed to building a Pennsylvania where everyone belongs.
