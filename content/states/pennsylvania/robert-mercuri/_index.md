Robert Mercuri, often known as Rob Mercuri, is an American politician who has been serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since 2021, representing District 28. He is also running in the 2024 Republican primary in Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district.

Born around 1982, Mercuri was raised in West Deer Township and attended Deer Lake High School, graduating in 2000. He then graduated from the United States Military Academy in 2004 and was deployed to Iraq. After completing his military service, Mercuri enrolled in night classes offered by the University of Massachusetts Amherst and worked for two accounting firms in New York City. He returned to Pennsylvania when hired by PNC Financial Services. Along with his wife, Kelsey, Mercuri owns a small business located in Wexford.

Mercuri's political career began when incumbent representative Mike Turzai of House District 28 announced that he would not run for reelection in 2020. Mercuri won a Republican Party primary against Michael Heckmann and Libby Blackburn, with Turzai's endorsement. He defeated Emily Skopov in the 2020 general election and won reelection in 2022, defeating Democratic nominee Alison Duncan.

Mercuri serves on the House Finance, Education, and Government Oversight committees and is the vice chair of the House Republican Policy Committee. He has worked to make progress across a number of legislative priorities including fiscal responsibility, responsible energy expansion, educational choices, and effective and efficient government. He has also focused much of his attention on improving the openness and accountability of government, expanding educational opportunities while respecting taxpayers, reducing the cost of health care, developing programs to keep our communities safe, prioritizing the upkeep of critical infrastructure, and harnessing the potential of the advanced energy economy for the benefit of residents and the future of our Commonwealth.

In October 2022, Mercuri was elected to serve on the Point Park University Board of Trustees. Before running for office, Mercuri attended the United States Military Academy at West Point and deployed to Baghdad as a member of an embedded military training unit. He returned home with a captainâ€™s rank and a Bronze Star Medal. Mercuri earned a Master of Business Administration from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and then worked for two major accounting firms. After being recruited by PNC, he rose to senior vice president in risk management and finance. He and his wife, Kelsey, own a pack and ship retail business in Pine Township. In service to his community, he has served as a member of the board of the YMCA, the United States Congressional Advisory Board, and the American Corporate Partners, which is a nonprofit that helps connect veterans with careers after their military experience. Mercuri lives in Pine Township with his wife and their three school-age children where they are active in their faith community.
