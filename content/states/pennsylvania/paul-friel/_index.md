Paul Friel was elected to the state PA House of Representatives in November 2022, serving the state’s 26th Legislative District in Chester County. Friel has spent his career innovating and leading in the manufacturing, retail and environmental sectors. Most recently, he was owner of PACE Environmental, an environmental testing and engineering firm.

He has also been highly invested in his community -- serving on the executive boards of nonprofits such as Camp Rainbow and the Philadelphia Boys’ Choir, coaching wrestling, and serving as president of the Owen J. Roberts School Board. Friel brings this perspective and experience to Harrisburg and is committed to working on some of the most pressing issues our families face:

- Making sure that high quality public education is available to every child, regardless of where they live and preparing each student in our Commonwealth for college if they choose, a career and civic life.
- Supporting innovative environmental policy that ensures clean air and water for future generations; promoting the development of strong and sustainable local economies and their energy and manufacturing sectors; and safeguarding open space, including the Commonwealth’s integral farmland.
- Protecting democracy by upholding voter rights and advocating for reforms that will increase the transparency and efficacy of government.

Friel grew up in Gilbertsville, PA and graduated from St. Pius X High School and Temple University. He married his high school sweetheart, Mary, and together they raised four children in the OJR School District. Rep. Paul Friel is serving the 26th Legislative District.
