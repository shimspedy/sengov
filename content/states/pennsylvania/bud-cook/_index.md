Donald "Bud" Cook was born on June 29, 1956. He is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, who has represented the 50th District since 2023. Prior to redistricting, Cook represented the 49th District from 2017 to 2022.

Cook graduated from California Area High School. After earning a Bachelor of Science degree from West Virginia Wesleyan College, Cook served two terms from 1986 to 1989 as a Buckhannon, West Virginia councilman.

In 2014, Cook unsuccessfully sought election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, losing to Democratic incumbent Peter Daley in the 49th District race. In 2016, Daley chose not to run for re-election. Cook once again ran for the 49th District seat and won. He won re-election in 2018 and 2020. Following redistricting, Cook ran for the 50th District seat in 2022, and won.

In 2020, Cook was among 26 Pennsylvania House Republicans who called for the reversal of Joe Biden's certification as the winner of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 United States presidential election, citing false claims of election irregularities.
