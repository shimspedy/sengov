Robert Leadbeter is an American politician and businessman serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 109th district. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Leadbeter was elected to serve the citizens of Columbia County’s 109th Legislative District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in November of 2022. During the 2023-24 Legislative Session, he serves on the House Insurance, Judiciary, and Liquor Control Committees.

Leadbeter holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Business Administration from Capella University. Prior to his political career, he served as a small business owner and senior executive for a major national company. From 2012 to 2015, Leadbeter worked as a territory manager for Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits. He joined AB InBev in 2015, working as a commercial director in San Francisco, national retail sales manager in the Northeast, and national director for draught products.

As a husband, father, accomplished businessman, and community leader, Leadbeter is acutely aware of the challenges facing Pennsylvania families, senior citizens, and small businesses. In Harrisburg, he supports policies that will lower taxes, encourage economic growth, increase personal freedom, and reduce the size and intrusiveness of government. He is also a strong advocate for local farmers, small businesses, and working families.

Leadbeter is an active member of New Covenant Church in Berwick where he serves on the security team and men’s support group. He also supports several local community organizations and charities. Leadbeter and his wife, Bethany, reside in Catawissa with their two young daughters.
