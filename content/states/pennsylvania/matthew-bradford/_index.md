Matthew Douglas Bradford, born on May 23, 1975, is an American attorney and politician. He is a member of the Democratic party and serves as a representative of the 70th district in Montgomery County in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

Bradford was raised in Chester County, the youngest of three boys. His mother, Marguerite, served her country in the United States Naval Reserve. His parents later opened a small family business where Bradford frequently worked after school, on weekends, and during the summer.

While working to help pay for school, Bradford earned his undergraduate and law degrees from Villanova University. During his undergraduate years, he was active in numerous charitable organizations and volunteered as a youth basketball coach for the local C.Y.O. In law school, Bradford spent the summer working for the United Steelworkers Union's General Counsel's Office, the United States Attorney's Office, and a federal district court judge.

After law school, Bradford was an associate in the law firm Drinker Biddle's litigation department. He took a leave from his practice when he was appointed municipal administrator and chief executive officer of Norristown Borough, serving alongside Gov. Ed Rendell's special advisor to Norristown, Joseph C. Vignola. Bradford is Of Counsel at a municipal law firm. He previously served as a solicitor for several Montgomery County communities and a school board.

Bradford was first elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2009. In addition to his prior service as chair of the House State Government Committee, Bradford served for eight years on the House Appropriations Committee. In 2018, his peers elected him to serve as chair of the committee. On February 28, 2023, Bradford was elected as Majority Leader for the Democratic Caucus.

Bradford resides in Worcester Township with his wife, Renee, and their four children. He is an avid Philadelphia sports fan.
