Jesse Willis Topper, born on September 19, 1981, is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He has been representing the 78th district since 2014.

Topper was born to John and Ruth Topper in Bedford, Pennsylvania, U.S. He was homeschooled and later graduated from Frostburg State University magna cum laude with a bachelor of arts degree in music performance.

Topper won a special election on January 28, 2014, to succeed Pennsylvania State Representative Dick Hess, who passed away during his term. He was reelected for four more consecutive terms. Prior to his election as a state representative, Topper served on the Bedford Borough Council for two years.

In the 2023-24 session, Topper is serving as the Republican chairman of the House Education Committee. He is now serving his fifth term in office representing residents of the 78th District, which consists of all of Bedford and Fulton counties.

Topper is fiscally and socially conservative. He is also pro-life and a "strong supporter" of the Second Amendment. Topper opposes legalizing adult use cannabis in Pennsylvania.

In his personal life, Topper was married to Christy Brallier, has two sons, and divorced in 2020. He previously served as a minister at a United Methodist Church in his hometown.
