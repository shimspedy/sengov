Judy Ward was elected to represent the 30th district in the Pennsylvania Senate on November 6, 2018 after serving two terms representing the interests of local communities in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives’ 80th District.
Judy is a Registered Nurse, as well as a former small business owner, development professional and wellness coordinator for Ward Transport and Logistics.
In the Senate, Judy has authored new laws providing additional resources to support Pennsylvania farmers; allow temporary nurse aides hired during the COVID-19 emergency declaration to receive certification to continue working in the field; help community-based health centers better meet the needs of patients in underserved areas; provide a tax exemption for any improvements and new construction on blighted properties in deteriorated areas; strengthen penalties for assaults against healthcare practitioners and technicians; protect victims of domestic violence; and expand Pennsylvanians’ access to psychology services.
She also led the fight in the General Assembly to require insurance companies to cover medications and treatments prescribed to patients facing Stage IV metastatic cancer and expand fundraising options for local charities dedicated to helping individuals who have cancer or developmental disabilities.
Judy currently serves as Chair of the Senate Aging and Youth Committee, which is responsible for reviewing legislation that affects the programs and services dedicated to senior citizens and younger Pennsylvanians. Under her leadership, the committee played a critical role in addressing flaws in the Wolf Administration’s management of nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The committee also considered legislation last year to improve newborn health screenings which was signed into law. She previously served as Chair of the Intergovernmental Operations Committee and the Urban Affairs and Housing Committee.
She also serves as a member of the following committees: Health and Human Services as Vice Chair, Intergovernmental Operations, Law and Justice, State Government, and the Rules and Executive Nominations Committee. She is also a member of the Advisory Council for the Hollidaysburg Veteran’s Home, the Long Term Care Council, and the Blair Senior Services Advisory Council, and she sits on the Pennsylvania Children’s Trust Fund Board.
In addition to her committee appointments, she also serves as Chair of the Maternal and Infant Health Caucus, the Senate Community Pharmacy Caucus, and the PA Rare Disease Caucus, and as a member of the Aviation Caucus, the Brain Injury Caucus, the Broadband Caucus, the Community College Caucus, the Cystic Fibrosis Caucus, the Early Childhood Education Caucus, the Economy, Business, and Jobs Caucus, the Homecare Caucus, the Irish Caucus, the Legislative Ski Caucus, the Lyme Disease and Tick Caucus, the Manufacturing Caucus, the Mental Health Caucus, the Oil and Gas Caucus, the Pro-Life Caucus, the Second Amendment Caucus, the Sportsmen’s Caucus, and the 9/11 Trail Caucus. She also sits on both the Joint Senate and House Prayer Caucus and Senate and House Fair Caucus.
Her primary goals are to seek improve Pennsylvania’s business climate, create jobs and to advance economic and agricultural opportunities for the 30th District.
A lifelong resident of Blair County, Judy graduated from Hollidaysburg High School and the Altoona Hospital School of Nursing.
She is a longtime member of the Blair County Chamber of Commerce, having graduated from the Chamber Leadership Blair County Program, and is a graduate of the Pennsylvania Rural Urban Leadership Program (R.U.L.E.) through Penn State University, which encourages and fosters the development of adult community leaders from all segments of the state, especially agricultural communities. Having served on many community and professional boards, she remains active with Food for Families Soup Kitchen.
Judy resides in Hollidaysburg with her husband, Bill. They have two grown sons, Bill Jr. (wife Ehrin) and Adam.
