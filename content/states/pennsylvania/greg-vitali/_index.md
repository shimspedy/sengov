Gregory Vitali, born on June 4, 1956, in Havertown, Pennsylvania, is a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He has represented the 166th district since 1993 and currently serves as the Democratic chair of the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee.

Vitali is a lifetime resident of Haverford Township and a graduate of St. Josephâ€™s Prep. He received his B.S in Economics (cum laude) from Villanova University and his J.D from Villanova University School of Law. As a solo practitioner in Havertown for 12 years, Greg learned both how laws affect real people and how to run a small business.

In 1993, he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as the first Democratic legislator from the 166th district. He serves on the House Environmental Resource and Energy Committee and has made environmental protection a priority in his role in the state house. Additionally, Vitali has taught classes on state and local government at Villanova and is an ex-officio member of the Bryn Mawr Film Institute's board of directors.

In January 2018, Vitali announced his intention to seek the Democratic nod for the US Congress for the 7th district after Pat Meehan declined to run for reelection. He lost to Mary Gay Scanlon, receiving 5,568 votes or 9.4 percent of the share.

Vitali is considered by many to be the leading environmental legislator in Harrisburg and has received numerous statewide environmental awards. He has dedicated his life to environmental protection.
