Mike Sturla, born on February 18, 1956, is a state representative for the 96th Legislative District in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. He was born and raised in Lancaster County and graduated from Garden Spot High School in 1974. He furthered his education at the University of Kansas, where he earned a bachelor's degree in Environmental Design in 1979.

After college, Mike Sturla founded a painting and construction firm with his brother. He later founded Aarchitrave, an architecture firm. His political career began when he was elected to the Lancaster City Council in 1987, where he served until his election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

Sturla assumed office as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 96th district on January 1, 1991. For most of his tenure in the legislature, he has been the only Democrat representing a significant portion of Lancaster County at the state or federal level. He served as House Democratic Policy Committee Chair until 2020 and currently serves as the Democratic minority chair of the House Urban Affairs Committee.

In addition to his legislative duties, Sturla serves on several caucuses, including the House Housing & Community Development Committee, the Chesapeake Bay Commission, the Autism and Intellectual Disabilities Caucus, the LGBTQ Equality Caucus, the PA SAFE Caucus, the Sportsmen's Caucus, the Welcoming PA Caucus, and the Womenâ€™s Health Caucus.

Sturla stirred controversy in August 2011 with written remarks he made about proposed drilling in the Marcellus Shale regions of Pennsylvania. He suggested that increased drilling would lead to the "spread of sexually transmitted disease amongst the womenfolk." Sturla apologized for his "insensitive" remarks, but defended himself by saying that his comments were based on a report to the Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission.

Sturla endorsed Tom Wolf in the 2014 Democratic Primary for Governor. He currently sits on the Urban Affairs committee.
