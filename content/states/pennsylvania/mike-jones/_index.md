Paul Michael Jones, known as Mike Jones, is an American politician and a member of the Republican Party. He has been representing the 93rd District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives since 2019.

Born around 1969 in York County, Pennsylvania, Jones grew up in Dallastown. He graduated from Dallastown Area High School in 1987 and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electronic engineering technology from DeVry University in 1991.

In 1994, Jones began working for St. Onge, a supply chain logistics company based in York, Pennsylvania. He was named president of the company in 2006 and served in this role until his retirement in 2017.

Jones briefly served on the board of the Dallastown Area School District after being elected in 2017. However, he resigned in 2019 after being elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, believing that serving on both the school board and in the State House would constitute a conflict of interest.

Jones was first elected to represent the 93rd District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2018 and has since been re-elected in 2020 and 2022. In 2020, he founded the Economic Growth Caucus, a group of state representatives with backgrounds in business. The group's purpose is to promote economic growth, and Jones serves as its chairman.

Jones has been vocal in his opposition to mitigation and lockdown measures imposed by Governor Tom Wolf during the COVID-19 pandemic. He participated in the "Reopen Pennsylvania" rally outside the state capitol building, where protestors demanded Governor Wolf repeal lockdown measures.

In 2020, Jones was among 26 Pennsylvania House Republicans who called for the reversal of Joe Biden's certification as the winner of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 United States presidential election, citing claims of election irregularities.

In 2022, Republican leadership removed Jones from three of his four committee assignments after he endorsed Joe D'Orsie and Wendy Fink in their primary challenges against incumbent Representatives Keith Gillespie and Stan Saylor. Jones stated that his decision to endorse the two challengers was not personal but "business" because Gillespie and Saylor did not oppose COVID shutdowns.
