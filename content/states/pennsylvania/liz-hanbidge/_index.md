Liz Hanbidge is a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 61st Legislative District in Montgomery County. The 61st Legislative District includes parts of Whitpain Township, Lower Gwynedd Township and Upper Gwynedd Township, Towamencin Township, and North Wales Borough.

On November 6, 2018, Liz Hanbidge was elected to represent the 61st Legislative District in Montgomery County, becoming the first Democrat to serve the district since its formation in 1969. As a business owner and child advocate, Liz is committed to ensuring Pennsylvania’s most vulnerable are the state government’s top priority.

Liz believes that, for too long, career politicians throughout Pennsylvania have ignored their constituents and catered to special interests. Liz has dedicated her career to giving a voice to the voiceless, fighting to protect those most harmed by Harrisburg’s apathy. Now, she's ready to extend that role to raise the unheard voices of Montgomery County.

Prior to joining the state legislature, Liz owned a law practice in Montgomery County serving families, small businesses and nonprofit organizations. Liz and her family first moved to Blue Bell in 2001 while she pursued a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Pennsylvania. After earning graduate degrees in Psychology from the University of Oxford and Harvard University, as well as a law degree from the University of Wisconsin, Liz returned to the area in 2008 to open a family law practice.

As a practicing attorney, Liz has devoted much of her time to pro bono work with the Montgomery County Child Advocacy Project. As a court-appointed guardian defending victims of abuse and neglect, Liz works tirelessly with police, Judges, and the Office of Children and Youth to help protect the most vulnerable children throughout the county.

Most recently, Liz has been teaching civics to sixth graders at Gwyn-Nor Elementary and East Norriton Middle School, working in conjunction with the local bar association. Liz lives on a farm near Montgomery County Community College where she spends her early mornings tending to her family of horses before beginning her workday. When she’s not busy in the legislature, classroom, or courtroom, Liz enjoys the company of her beloved canine companions, the occasional triathlon, and putting her soprano opera-training to use for her friends and family.
