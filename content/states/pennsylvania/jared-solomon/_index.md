Jared G. Solomon, born on November 18, 1978, is a dedicated community leader, accomplished attorney, and Army Reserve JAG officer. He was elected to serve his first term in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in November 2016, representing the 202nd District. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Solomon was raised in the Castor Gardens neighborhood by his single mother. He credits his success to remaining loyal to the neighborhood in which he was brought up and believing in the power of ordinary people to make a difference. He attended Swarthmore College and Villanova Law School, furthering his commitment to public service and the law.

After graduating, he practiced antitrust and securities law before serving in the Army Reserves as a JAG officer. From 2008 to 2016, Solomon founded and served as president of a local civic group in Northeast Philadelphia called Take Back Your Neighborhood. He continues to live in the same neighborhood where he grew up, with his wife Tiffani and their daughter Charlotte.

His political career began with a defeat in the 2014 Democratic Primary against incumbent Mark B. Cohen. However, Solomon subsequently defeated Cohen in the 2016 Democratic Primary and then ran unopposed in the election for the 202nd District seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He served on the Aging & Older Adult Services, Children & Youth, Education, State Government and Tourism & Recreational Development committees. He is currently chair of the PA House Veterans Affairs and Emergency Preparedness Committee.

On September 12, 2023, Solomon announced that he would run for Pennsylvania Attorney General. During his Attorney General campaign announcement rally, Solomon released a substantial list of 20 legislative endorsements for his campaign, including House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery), House Majority Whip Dan Miller (D-Allegheny), and state Sen. Christine Tartaglione (D-Philadelphia). In October, VoteVets, the largest progressive group of veterans in America, became the first nationwide organization to endorse Solomon in the race for state attorney general.

Solomon's priorities as a legislator include workforce development, supporting veterans, election and government reform, and landlord-tenant issues. He invites constituents to email him regarding any state-related issue or concern they may have.
