Kristin Marcell is a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing District 178. She assumed office on December 1, 2022, and her current term ends on November 30, 2024. She ran for election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to represent District 178 and won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Born in Doylestown Township, Pennsylvania, Marcell currently resides in Wrightstown, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Council Rock High School in 1995. She earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Pennsylvania State University in 1999 and a master's degree in public policy from George Washington University in 2006.

Before being elected to the House for the 2022-23 term, Marcell was a communications professional, school board member, and volunteer in her community. In 2014, she attended her first school board meeting as a parent fighting to save their local elementary school from closure. This experience made her realize that there was more she could do for her community.

She successfully ran for the Council Rock School Board in 2019, where she advocated for students and to give parents a voice in their kids’ education. She also worked with others to safely reopen Council Rock schools during the pandemic. In addition to her work on the school board, Kristin served on the Middle Bucks Institute of Technology’s Executive Council.

Prior to serving on the school board, Marcell worked for two decades in the private sector to provide strategic and communications counsel to businesses in the energy, environmental, and utility industries. Before entering the private sector, Kristin served in the public sector after graduating from college. She worked at the U.S. Department of Transportation as the communications director of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. She also served in the U.S. Congress where she learned first-hand about the legislative process.

Marcell's career experience includes working as the communications director of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration under former President George W. Bush. She has served as the vice chair of the Middle Bucks Institute of Technology's Executive Council.

Marcell resides in Wrightstown with her husband and their two children.
