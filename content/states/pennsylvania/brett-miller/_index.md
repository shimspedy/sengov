Brett Miller is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives representing 41st District. He was born on July 22, 1961, in the Poconos region and moved to Lancaster County to start his career as a guidance counselor. He spent more than 20 years at Warwick Middle School where he was also a coach for track and field.

Miller earned degrees from Liberty University and certifications from Penn State and Millersville. He served three terms as township supervisor in East Hempfield Township. In 2014, Rep. Ryan Aument announced he would not seek reelection as he made a bid for the 36th district State Senate seat. Miller successfully sought the Republican nomination for the 41st House district and defeated Democratic challenger Alice Yoder in the Lancaster suburban and Republican-leaning district.

He assumed office on January 6, 2015, and his current term ends on November 30, 2024. His committee assignments include Aging & Older Adult Services, Consumer Affairs, Local Government, and State Government, Subcommittee on Public Pensions, Benefits and Risk Management - Chair.

Brett Miller is committed to continuing the 41st Districtâ€™s proud tradition of straight-talking, reform-minded leadership in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. After nine years of service as an East Hempfield Township supervisor (the last four as board chairman), Brett has earned a reputation as a true friend to the taxpayer.
