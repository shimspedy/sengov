Rick Krajewski was born on June 21, 1991, in New York City, New York. He is an American politician who currently serves in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives representing the 188th legislative district. He is a member of the Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialists of America.

Krajewski was first elected during the 2020 Pennsylvania House of Representatives election, when he primaried incumbent Democrat Jim Roebuck. Prior to being elected to the state house, he worked as a software developer, leaving that job in order to work full-time as an activist. Krajewski is active in the organization and field campaigning of the progressive activist group Reclaim Philadelphia.

He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in engineering in 2013. During his time at the university, he co-founded a campus group for mixed-race students. After graduation, Krajewski worked as a software engineer and taught volunteer programming classes at Huey Elementary School in West Philadelphia before it was closed down and replaced by a charter school. This experience gave him a firsthand look into the problems facing our public education system.

As a working-class multi-racial Black man raised in poverty by a single mother who taught him heâ€™d have to fight for what he needed because no one else was going to do it for him, Krajewski believes courage and community are fundamental for everyone to thrive. As an organizer, he knows people power is necessary to transform systems for the better.

Krajewski lives in Walnut Hill with his cat, Sriracha. He likes to spend his spare time woodworking, going on bike rides, and cooking. He makes a mean peach pie.
