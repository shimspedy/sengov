Leanne Krueger is an American politician from Pennsylvania currently serving as a Democratic member for the Pennsylvania House of Representative, District 161 since 2015. She made history in 2015 as the first woman to represent the district.

Born on February 14, 1977, in North Brunswick, Middlesex County, NJ, she graduated from North Brunswick High School in 1995. She received her bachelor's degree in sociology from Rutgers University in 1999 and a master's degree in business administration from Eastern University. She also holds an E.M.B.A. from St. Joseph's University, which she earned in 2017.

Before her political career, Krueger served as the executive director of the Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia between 2004 and 2013, where she worked with local businesses to promote their growth and environmentally conscious business practices. She went on to work as the senior director for strategy and development for the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (BALLE) in 2013.

Krueger ran for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives seat in the 161st district in the 2014 elections, losing to incumbent Joe Hackett of the Republican Party. Hackett resigned in 2015 and Krueger won the special election to fill the remainder of his term in August 2015. She was sworn in on August 25. She was reelected in 2016 and in 2018.

Krueger currently sits on the Appropriations, Environmental Resources & Energy, and Labor & Industry committees. She was elected as the Majority Caucus Administrator in February 2023.
