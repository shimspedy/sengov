G. Roni Green is a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 190th District. She was elected to this position in 2022. Prior to her election, she served as a community and labor organizer for more than 30 years, most recently as a business agent for SEIU Local 668. She has been a lifelong activist for all working people in Philadelphia and beyond, and also serves as a Democratic committeewoman.

Green started her career as a human services caseworker with the Glendale County Assistance Office, working for nearly two decades to ensure that Philadelphia’s most vulnerable residents had access to a path out of poverty. Her experience has deeply informed her understanding of the systemic causes of economic, social, and political inequality.

As a state representative, Green’s priorities include fighting for workers’ rights, affordable housing to preserve neighborhoods and ensure that every working family has a home, sensible gun reform to combat the gun violence epidemic, equitable community and economic development that provides opportunities to all, and criminal justice reform with a focus on ending mass incarceration.

Green previously represented the 190th Legislative District, having been elected in a special election in February of 2020 and serving through Nov. 30, 2020. She was born on June 9, 1959, and graduated from Murrell Dobbins Vocational High School in 1977. She later attended George Meany Labor College.

In February 2020, Green won a special election to fill the 190th District seat of Pennsylvania State Representative Movita Johnson-Harrell, who had pled guilty to charity theft in 2019. Green failed to win the 2020 general primary election, and was defeated by fellow Democrat Amen Brown. In 2022, Brown was redistricted to the 10th District. Green ran for the 190th seat again and won.
