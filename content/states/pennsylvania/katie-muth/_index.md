Katie J. Muth is an American politician serving as a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania State Senate, representing the 44th District. Her district includes portions of northeastern Chester and southwestern Montgomery and Berks Counties. Muth serves in Senate Democratic Leadership as the Democratic Policy Committee Chair.

Born on September 20, 1983, Muth was educated at Penn State where she earned a bachelor’s degree in Athletic Training, and obtained her master’s degree at A.T. Still University of Health Sciences in Mesa, Arizona. While completing her master’s thesis, she promoted health care for student athletes and studied concussion-related injuries at high schools in the Phoenix area. Muth most recently served as an adjunct professor of kinesiology at a local university, while also practicing sports medicine.

First elected to office in 2018, Senator Muth is a passionate advocate for change. Grounded in the strong values of hard work, dedication, and commitment to helping others, Senator Muth is determined to be a champion for hardworking Pennsylvanians. She has challenged both her own party and the opposition in her first three years in the Capitol, while dubbing her workplace as the “dome of corruption.”

In the 2018 election, Muth was unopposed in the Democratic primary. In the general election, she defeated incumbent Republican John Rafferty - who had represented the 44th District since 2003 - by a margin of 62,692 to 57,943 (52% to 48%). Her victory was part of the "blue wave" that increased Democratic and female representation in the Pennsylvania General Assembly and Congressional delegation.

In the 2022 election, Muth was unopposed in the Democratic primary. In the general election, she defeated Republican Jessica Florio. Muth won by a margin of 70,790 to 56,343.

Muth supports initiatives such as rebate programs to decrease property taxes, along with ending increasing property taxes. She supports increasing taxes for corporations, with an emphasis on the fossil fuel industry. She supports state-sponsored healthcare for all.

During a budget debate in June 2019, Senator Muth took the floor and read a letter from a disabled constituent who relies on the PA General Assistance Program. Throughout her reading, Republican Majority Leader Jake Corman of Bellefonte loudly raised a point of order which was not recognized by the president (Democratic Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman). The Republican-controlled Senate voted against renewing the program 26–24.

On November 8, 2019, Muth tweeted her official endorsement of Senator Elizabeth Warren in her bid for President.

Muth made headlines when she sued Pennsylvania’s largest public pension system amid a federal investigation into aspects of the agency’s undertakings, saying agency officials have refused to share documents with her, even though she is a board member. Muth’s lawsuit said board members are being asked to vote on approximately $1 billion in investments at Thursday’s meeting, “yet attempts to obtain information, data and documents that in her view could better inform” those decisions were rejected.
