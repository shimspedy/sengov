Mindy Fee is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. She has been representing the 37th District, based in northern Lancaster County, since 2013.

Born and raised in Manheim, Pennsylvania, Mindy attended the Manheim Central School District and later pursued higher education at Millersville University, where she received a bachelor's degree in economics.

Before her political career, Mindy spent much of her working career in sales management, most notably with TransAmerican Office Furniture. Her understanding of the private sector and small business experience has been a valuable asset in her role as a legislator.

Mindy is the widow of former Manheim mayor and local district magistrate Tom Fee, and is a mother to three children - Danielle, Ryan, and Abby.

Her journey into politics began when incumbent State Representative Tom Creighton decided to retire. In the 2012 Republican primary for the 37th District, Mindy defeated Stephen Black and Barry McFarland, after first winning a straw poll of local Republican Party committee members. She went on to win the general election and was re-elected in 2014.

As a member of the House, Mindy has been assigned to several committees including Agriculture & Rural Affairs, Game & Fisheries, Professional Licensure, Tourism & Recreational Development, and Transportation. She also serves as the Chair for the Subcommittee on Arts and Entertainment and the Subcommittee on Transportation Safety.
