Dan Williams was elected as the state representative for the 74th Legislative District in November 2018. He has been a dedicated resident of Chester County for more than three decades and understands the needs of his neighbors, ranging from infants to seniors and employees to retirees.

As a former UPS supervisor and Teamster member, Dan knows first-hand the importance of unions to ensuring the working class earns a family sustaining wage, has access to affordable healthcare, and is afforded proper protections on the job.

He's been both a devoted Senior Pastor of New Life in Christ Fellowship Church in Coatesville and a passionate community leader for more than 25 years. During that time, he's spearheaded initiatives to get illegal guns off the street through a "Guns for Amnesty Program", improve community-police relations by providing a forum to open the lines of communication, help the homeless through various food and clothing drives, and deliver hundreds of care packages to our service men and women overseas.

A graduate of Geneva College and Biblical Seminary in Hatfield, Pa., Dan knows the value of a quality education. He also runs the Willia Mae Williams Memorial Scholarship Fund, named after his late mother, with his family, which awards merit scholarships to young people based on academic achievement.

Dan's family is his top priority. He is committed to his loving wife of 38 years, Baleria Alston Williams, their three children and one grandson.

Dan Williams (Democratic Party) is a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing District 74. He assumed office on December 1, 2018. His current term ends on November 30, 2024. Williams (Democratic Party) ran for re-election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to represent District 74. He won in the general election on November 8, 2022.

Williams has been assigned to various committees throughout his tenure, including the Aging & Older Adult Services Committee, Human Services Committee, Professional Licensure Committee, House Veterans Affairs & Emergency Preparedness Committee, and Urban Affairs Committee.
