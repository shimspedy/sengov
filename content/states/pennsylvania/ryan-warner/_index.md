Ryan Warner is a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 52nd House district in Fayette County and Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. He assumed office on January 6, 2015, succeeding Deberah Kula. He is a member of the Republican party.

Warner's personal details include his residence in Perryopolis and his alma mater, Penn State. He is married to Leslie and they have two children, Ben and Paloma.

In terms of his career, Warner has been assigned to several committees including Appropriations, Consumer Affairs, Environmental Resources & Energy, and Transportation. Notably, he serves as the Chair for the Subcommittee on Energy under the Environmental Resources & Energy committee.

Before his political career, Warner graduated from Frazier High School in Perryopolis in 2001. He is considered politically conservative, with the American Conservative Union's Center for Legislative Accountability giving him a lifetime rating of 91.78.

Warner brings his blue-collar roots and rural heritage to the state Capitol as the representative for the 52nd Legislative District serving part of Fayette County. He was first elected to serve in the state House in November 2014.

His legislative goals are directed toward helping his local communities by making the region attractive to job creators and implementing effective job training programs. He also supports legislation to cut out wasteful government spending, reduce property taxes, fight back against drug abuse and related crime, maintain strong agricultural traditions, and enhance hunting and fishing opportunities.

Prior to his election to state office, Warner started working at a young age in a sawmill for the family logging business and then continued his career at Siemens Industry as a project controller. There, he controlled revenue and expenditures and managed projects to assure they were completed on time and within budget. He is also no stranger to the hardships faced by his neighbors and communities after his position was eliminated due to corporate downsizing.

A native of Fayette County, Warner and his family have been long-time members of the community, having operated a family farm and successful logging business. Warner's community involvement also includes volunteer work with the United Way, where he organized food drives and holiday gift giving, and as an officer with the Slovak Catholic Sokol Assembly 25.
