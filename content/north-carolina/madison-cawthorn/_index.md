Congressman Cawthorn has rocked the status quo in Washington, D.C. following his election to Congress in 2020. The left-wing media has launched every false attack and smear campaign imaginable to block Congressman Cawthorn’s status as a rising star in the Republican Party. He is the youngest Republican to ever be elected to the United States Congress, and currently the youngest member of Congress.

As of October 2021, Congressman Cawthorn has introduced more bills in the U.S. House than any other freshman member of Congress, solidifying his policy positions and defining his office’s legislative priorities. Following the presidential election in 2020, he helped lead the charge to protect election integrity and objected to the House’s certification of the presidential election results. 

Congressman Cawthorn has emerged as one of President Trump’s strongest and most ardent defenders in the Unites States Congress. The fake news media has labeled him “Trump 2.0” and consistently derided him for his support of the President’s agenda. He is a fervent Christian and constitutional Conservative.

Congressman Cawthorn serves on the House Education and Labor Committee and the House Veterans Affairs Committee. He is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, the Republican Study Committee, and the vice-chairman of the Freedom from Big Tech Caucus.

Congressman Cawthorn resides in Hendersonville, North Carolina with his wife, Cristina Cawthorn.
