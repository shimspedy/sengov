Congressman Brad Knott represents North Carolina’s 13th Congressional District including Wake, Johnston, Lee, Harnett, Franklin, Caswell, Person and Granville counties. Elected in 2024, Brad is serving his first term in the U.S. House of Representatives.

In the 119th Congress, Brad serves on the House Judiciary, Transportation & Infrastructure and Homeland Security committees. Brad’s focus in Congress is combatting pervasively serious crime, building an environment for continued economic growth in North Carolina’s 13th District and across the nation and defending against persistent threats to our country from within our own borders.

Prior to serving in Congress, Brad proudly worked alongside law enforcement at all levels to prosecute organized crime in cases that touched every corner of the country. This included drug cartels, human trafficking, financial crimes, national gangs and more. From this experience, Brad saw how harmful policies and weak law enforcement wounded communities all over the country. This, in large part, motivated Brad to run for office.

Brad looks to pull from his experience to support robust law enforcement while strengthening the laws to simultaneously disincentivize illegal immigration and protect Americans from all types of crime.

Brad and his wife Joanna are both lifelong North Carolinians and have two daughters. He holds a Juris Doctorate from Wake Forest University School of Law and a bachelor’s degree from Baylor University.
