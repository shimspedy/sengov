Addison McDowell proudly represents North Carolina’s 6th Congressional District. Motivated by the tragic loss of his younger brother, Luke, to a fentanyl overdose, McDowell’s top priority in Congress is to tackle the drug crisis and strengthen border security to protect families and communities from the dangers posed by illegal immigration.

Addison currently serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the Natural Resources Committee, and the Budget Committee. Through these committee assignments, he is fighting to make sure the critical needs of North Carolina’s Sixth District are met.

Prior to Congress, Addison’s public service included serving on staff for Congressman (now U.S. Senator) Ted Budd and Congressman Richard Hudson, where he spent each day helping constituents in need.

Addison earned his Bachelors of Arts degree in Political Science and Government from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. During this time, he met his wife, Rachel, through YoungLife Ministry.

A native of Lexington, North Carolina, Addison and Rachel now reside in Davie County, where they are raising their two daughters and are active in their local church.
