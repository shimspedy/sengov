Harrigan brings a lifetime of service, leadership, and innovation to the U.S. House of Representatives. A combat-decorated Green Beret and a successful entrepreneur, Pat has dedicated his career to tackling challenges—on the battlefield, in business, and now in Congress.

After graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point with a degree in Nuclear Engineering, Pat commissioned as an Infantry officer and was stationed at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. He deployed to Afghanistan as a young Platoon Leader, commanding a remote combat outpost in the heart of the Arghandab Valley. At just 23 years old, Pat managed over 350 personnel and $100 million in infrastructure and equipment, gaining invaluable experience in high-pressure leadership.

Recognizing the need for even greater expertise in unconventional warfare, Pat volunteered for and earned the Green Beret. As a member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, he returned to Afghanistan to lead operations in increasingly complex and volatile environments. For his service, he earned two Bronze Stars, a recognition of his extraordinary valor and effectiveness in combat. These experiences shaped his understanding of the critical connection between accountability, mission success, and guiding teams under pressure.

While serving in the military, Pat and his wife Rocky launched a small firearms business out of their home. Rooted in North Carolinian values of hard work and ingenuity, the company grew rapidly. What began in their living room quickly scaled into a thriving enterprise, producing American-made defense products that support national security. Today, the company operates out of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Western North Carolina, creating jobs and fostering innovation for the region.

The fall of Afghanistan marked a turning point for Pat. Watching the consequences of failed leadership unfold, he knew he had to act. Motivated by his dedication to his country and a desire to restore strength and accountability to Washington, Pat stepped forward to serve in Congress.

Now, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Pat applies the same principles that guided him in the Army and in business: bold leadership, unshakable integrity, and a commitment to delivering results.

Pat and his wife Rocky have been married for 13 years and are the proud parents of two daughters, Reagan and McKinley. As North Carolina’s voice in Congress, Pat is dedicated to serving the hardworking families and communities of the Tenth District. In every role—whether leading soldiers, growing a business, or serving his constituents—Pat remains dedicated to building a stronger, more secure America.
