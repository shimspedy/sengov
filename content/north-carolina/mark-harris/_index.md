Congressman Mark Harris represents the people of North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District. He wants to be a voice for North Carolina families, not just a vote. He is dedicated to fighting for our values and freedoms and against government overreach.

A native North Carolinian, Mark brings a lifetime of serving others to the U.S. House of Representatives. Mark served as the senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Charlotte for over a decade, navigating multiple economic downturns and challenges. He has experienced firsthand the many ways that the government can impact people’s lives, for better and for worse. But Mark’s leadership goes beyond the pulpit. Mark served as president of the North Carolina Baptist Convention, where he was a key leader in passing North Carolina’s Marriage Amendment — which defined marriage as between one man and one woman.

Mark is married to his college sweetheart, Beth. They have three adult children and ten grandchildren. Mark graduated from Appalachian State University with a Bachelor of Science in Political Science. He went on to receive a Master of Divinity and a Doctor of Ministry from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. In Congress, Mark expects to be appointed to the House Agriculture and Judiciary Committees.
