Representative Susie Lee was born to a working family of ten in Canton, Ohio. A product of the public education system, she attended Carnegie Mellon University where she used a combination of scholarships, loans, and part-time jobs to pay for her education.  

Rep. Lee moved to Las Vegas in 1993, where she became an education non-profit leader. She worked to improve the education system, decrease school dropout rates, and provide after-school programming for Nevada students. Her career taught her how to take on tough problems, roll up her sleeves, and bring people together to find solutions for Nevadaâ€™s problems. 

In Congress, she is fighting to improve our education system, honor our promise to our veterans, and tackle rising health care costs. Rep. Lee believes in working across the aisle and bringing people together to solve problems, which is why she joined the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. She now lives in Las Vegas with her two children.
