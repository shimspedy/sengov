     greeting: contact Governor Steve Sisolak 
     description: Governor Steve Sisolak was born into a working-class family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin where his parents, Ed and Mary worked hard to provide for their three children. Gov. Sisolak inherited their blue-collar ethic, working full-time to put himself through college at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He then enrolled in UNLV’s Graduate Studies Program, where he received a master’s degree in 1978. Gov. Sisolak put down roots in Las Vegas, built his own communications business, all while raising his two daughters on his own as a single father. Motivated by his passion for education, Gov. Sisolak decided to give back to the community that supported him by serving on the Nevada Board of Regents for 10 years. In 2008, after 10 years as a University Regent, Gov. Sisolak was elected to the Clark County Commission, where he served as chairman until being sworn in as governor of Nevada.
