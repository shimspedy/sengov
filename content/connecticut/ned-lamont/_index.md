Governor Ned Lamont is a father, husband, and business owner who has dedicated himself to serving the public. For Ned, this isn't about politics. This is about continuing the progress we have made and keeping our state moving forward.

Governor Lamont is fighting every day for Connecticut – growing jobs, cutting taxes, and investing in our schools and our communities – as he leads our state into the future.


For the first time in over 80 years, Connecticut has a Governor who began his career as a business owner and job creator. Governor Ned Lamont started a family and launched a successful business in our state because he believes in Connecticut: hard work, dedication, and neighbors looking out for one another.

Now, as Governor, he’s rolling out the welcome mat for more families and even more businesses to call Connecticut home — with lower taxes, more job opportunities, stronger schools, historic budget surpluses, and a pandemic recovery that is unmatched nationally.

For the first time in over 80 years, Connecticut has a Governor who began his career as a business owner and job creator. He took on the telecom giants because he saw a better way to deliver value to customers, eventually growing his business to serve more than 400 of the nation’s largest college campuses and over a million students. He brings his business experience to work every day as Governor, constantly finding more ways for the state to attract new innovative companies and spur more job creation.

Ever since he started his career, Governor Lamont has focused on giving back to those in need. He ran a local newspaper, served in local office, volunteered as a high school teacher in Bridgeport, stood up for his convictions as a U.S. Senate candidate against Joe Lieberman and the war in Iraq in 2006, and served on the boards of Mercy Corps and the Conservation Services Group. He’s fought for Connecticut values, and he’s delivered meaningful results.

Governor Lamont is a graduate of Harvard College and earned a Master of Business Administration from the Yale School of Management. He’s been married to his wife, Annie, for nearly 40 years, and they have three children: Emily, Lindsay, and Teddy.

## WHAT NED'S DONE

For the past four years, Governor Lamont has been the strong leader Connecticut needs during challenging times.

He put partisanship aside and brought Republicans and Democrats together to get our state back on track. Governor Lamont’s leadership turned deficits into surplus, cut taxes, and provided record funding for our schools and our communities. And he led the state through the pandemic — keeping our schools and businesses open and our people safe.

Connecticut is going strong — and, with Governor Ned Lamont leading the way, we’ll keep getting stronger.

#### Cutting Taxes
Connecticut families needed relief, and Governor Lamont stepped up to the plate:

- Signed the largest tax relief package in state history — $660 million — while still ensuring a historic surplus
- Immediately put money back in people’s pockets with a gas tax holiday, a capped car tax, and an increased child tax rebate of up to $250 per child

#### Balancing the Budget
When Governor Lamont took office, he faced a nearly $4 billion deficit, and the state hadn’t operated a surplus in decades. He instituted a “debt diet” and turned things around:

- Eliminated the budget deficit he inherited, without raising taxes
- Led the state to a record budget surplus of nearly $4 billion
- Secured the first bond rating upgrade in 20 years in 2021

- Supported Connecticut restaurants, signing executive orders to expand outdoor dining and allow sales of to-go cocktails, saving “hundreds of restaurants”.
- Restored funding for the states ‘unemployment insurance trust fund’ removing a large burden for businesses.
-Recruited new businesses to grow right here in Connecticut, including Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Frito-Lay, WellSpark Health, and many more
