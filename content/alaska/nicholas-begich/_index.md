Born in Anchorage and raised by his maternal grandparents, Congressman Nick Begich embodies the spirit of Alaska. Nick grew up learning the values that make Alaska strong: self-reliance, honesty, and a deep-seated love for this land and its people. Today, he lives in Chugiak with his wife, Dharna, and their son Nicholas, continuing the tradition of raising the next generation of Alaskans on these same principles.

Nick pursued higher education in the Lower 48, graduating from Baylor University with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Entrepreneurship, and later completing his Master of Business Administration at Indiana University. His education equipped him with the skills to navigate the complex world of business. Recruited by Ford Motor Company, Nick sharpened these skills in a variety of roles, from technology to finance to product development; but the call of home was too strong.

In 2004, Nick and Dharna returned to Alaska, ready to give back to the state they love. Over the years, Nick has kickstarted numerous businesses, both within and beyond Alaska's borders. His business ventures have been built on innovation and industry. Nick's dedication doesn't stop at his own businesses - he has served as a startup coach and mentor, fostering the growth of early-stage companies and helping them thrive.

Nick has continuously invested in Alaska. His prior work with the Alaska Policy Forum, Club for Growth, and his years as a Board Director for Matanuska Telecom Association, show his commitment to public service and to Alaska's progress. Nick has seen firsthand the challenges Alaskans face, and he has the skills and experience to address these issues head-on.

Nick's goal in Congress is to make sure Alaskans succeed. His lifelong connection to this land, his passion for responsible business growth, and his belief in the power of hardworking Alaskan families make him the leader we need to take on Washington and deliver for Alaska.
