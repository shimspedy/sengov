James Moylan proudly serves as Guam’s congressional delegate to the 118th United States Congress. 

As the first Republican to win the seat on Guam in nearly 30 years, Moylan's victory was historic. 
He is a strong and trustworthy leader who’s focused on issues that affect Guamanians most. 

Moylan believes island residents have a right to know what’s happening in their governing offices. Therefore, he has created an open door policy allowing constituents to have their concerns addressed. 

Moylan’s history of service includes his time as a senator in the 35th and 36th Guam Legislature, a Veteran of the United States army and a parole officer at the Department of Corrections. 

Additionally, Moylan has more than two decades of experience working in the private sector, including healthcare, financial services, and insurance.

In his current position, Moylan serves on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee.  Both Committees address issues that are vital to Guam.

Additionally, Moylan is a native of Guam and is from the village of Tumon. He graduated from John F Kennedy High School and continued to the University of Guam where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice.  

Most of all, Moylan is a proud father to Abby and Krissy Moylan.
