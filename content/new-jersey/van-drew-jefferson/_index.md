A lifelong advocate for South Jersey, Jeff Van Drew is delivering results for veterans, seniors, consumers and children.

On November 3rd, 2020, constituents in New Jerseys Second Congressional District elected Jeff Van Drew to represent them in the United States House of Representatives for his second term. He was sworn in on January 3rd, 2021.  

Before getting elected to Congress, Congressman Van Drew previously served four terms in the New Jersey State Senate. He has earned a reputation as a strong advocate for southern New Jersey municipalities, but especially for veterans, senior citizens and consumers. He demonstrates a willingness to work on a bipartisan basis, addressing issues of vital concern to the residents of his district. Congressman Van Drew recently retired from dentistry after 30 years of practice in South Jersey. He and his wife have two children and two grandchildren, and reside in Dennis Township.

## ECONOMY
The Great Recession, coupled with the collapse of four casinos and the loss of 10,000 jobs, hit South Jersey harder than almost any other region in the United States. Atlantic County has the highest foreclosure rate in the Nation, and for years we have lagged behind the rest of the country in unemployment.

We must work harder to bring manufacturing jobs back to South Jersey. We must do all that we can to promote our vital tourism economy. The government needs to do more to help, not hinder, our agriculture and fishing industries. There is so much potential here in South Jersey, and Representative Van Drew will work every day to fight to bring jobs back here for our working families.

To boost our economy, we need tax reform that benefits middle-class families, not the multi-millionaires and corporate giants. It is time for a real middle-class tax cut that benefits hard-working South Jersey families and small businesses.

## IMMIGRATION
America is a place of hope and opportunity where you can work hard, support your family and create a better life. That dream has become increasingly harder to reach because of our broken immigration system, and we need new approaches that are tough, practical, and fair. We need comprehensive reform that must start by strengthening border security and cracking down on employers that knowingly circumvent the law. Additionally, by requiring employers to verify workers we will reduce the hiring of unauthorized workers, increase the accessibility of visas for high-skilled workers, and allow law-abiding immigrant families to come out of the shadows, pay taxes, play by the rules, and earn their citizenship. We need realistic approaches to protect children that came here as minors and grew up identifying as American, and policies that treat them fairly.

## EDUCATION AND COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY
Education is the essence of American opportunity. A quality education levels the playing field and makes the system fair, but it has become unaffordable for so many South Jersey families. Clearer and standardize definitions of financial aid are necessary for students to make informed decisions about higher education. Representative Van Drew has introduced Understanding the True Cost of College Act to do so. The skyrocketing costs of a college education are saddling many with outrageous student loan debt, which stops young families from becoming first-time home buyers and stagnates economic growth. We must get serious about this financial crisis and reduce the existing burden so that we can grow our economy.

## HEALTHCARE
As a Dentist, Representative Van Drew has a firsthand understanding of the American healthcare system and the need to make it both accessible and affordable. Together, we must focus on reforms to the Affordable Care Act that protect our families and small businesses, and work to lower the high cost of healthcare and prescription drugs.  Any attempt to strip coverage from the American people without a plan to replace it is unacceptable. That is why Rep. Van Drew supports efforts to condemn stripping healthcare away from people with pre-existing conditions.

## VETERANS & MILITARY
There is no commitment more important to our country than that of defending it, as millions of brave men and women have done. Our veterans are the heroes of our nation and deserve to be treated as such for being staunch defenders of our freedom. It is shameful that returning veterans often lack job opportunities, access to education, and critical healthcare services, and it is even more shameful that some of our heroes are left homeless and unemployed. In Congress, Representative Van Drew is fighting to reverse these failures and will work tirelessly until this is no longer the sad reality for the brave men and women of our military.

Amid the 2019 government shutdown, Rep. Van Drew has vehemently fought to pay the brave men and women in uniform.
