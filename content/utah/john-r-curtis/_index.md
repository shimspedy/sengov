For Senator Curtis, results matter. Guided by America’s founding principles, he tackles tough issues with innovative approaches, inviting all to the higher ground of common ground. He believes that big ideas, innovation, and consensus can drive transformational change. Senator Curtis is dedicated to crafting principle-centered policies and achieving real results for Utah and America. He leads critical conversations, convenes thoughtful leaders, fosters inclusive collaboration, develops sustainable solutions, and provides a vision of what is possible.

During his seven years representing Utah’s Third Congressional District, then-Representative Curtis passed 21 pieces of legislation into law. His accomplishments include better public land management, combating human trafficking, reducing burdensome regulations on small businesses, and more. He founded the Conservative Climate Caucus and was ranked by the nonpartisan Center for Effective Lawmaking as the 9th most effective Republican member of Congress. In 2023, his office earned recognition as the best in Congress for constituent accountability and accessibility.

Senator Curtis has built an international reputation for advancing American energy solutions that unleash U.S. clean fuels, strengthen the economy, enhance national security, ensure energy independence, and reduce global emissions simultaneously. He believes America must not only achieve energy independence but lead as an energy-dominant nation. Beyond energy, the Senator prioritizes strategic policies addressing China, fiscal responsibility, and solutions for broken social programs.

Before his time in Congress, Senator Curtis was a small business owner and a proven problem solver. He served as Mayor of Provo City for eight years, earning a 94% approval rating and being named the “Top Elected Official on Social Media” in 2015. His leadership was recognized with awards such as the Silicon Slopes Community Hero, UVU’s Civic Innovator Award, and Utah Valley Magazine’s Person of the Year.

Senator Curtis has been married to his wife, Sue, for 42 years. Together, they have six children and 17 grandchildren. Their family motto, “In Unity There is Strength,” continues to guide how he serves, works, and lives.
