### **Our Mission**

My mission is to redesign Sengov to be more user-friendly and easy to use, providing accurate and updated content for everyone in one place for free.


### **Our Story**


![john hashim](/john.jpg)

My name is [John Hashim](https://johnhashim.com/). I was born and raised in a refugee camp in Africa until the age of 18. Through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), I had the opportunity to come to the United States. I've always been passionate about building websites and coding. After earning my GED, I took an HTML and CSS course with Hope Works, which led to an internship. With the support of beautiful family who took me in as their own , I was hired by the same company. I worked there until 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

In 2021, I decided to pursue a childhood dream of serving in the Marine Corps. I developed a keen interest in politics and the biographies of public servants, often engaging in conversations about who I would vote for. This led to the creation of Sengov, initially focusing on governors, then senators, and eventually expanding to Congress and state-level officials.

My goal is to continually improve Sengov and add useful features for readers. I've worked on this project during weekends and military leaves, and it's rewarding to see people using it. Thank you for your support, and I look forward to making a difference together.
