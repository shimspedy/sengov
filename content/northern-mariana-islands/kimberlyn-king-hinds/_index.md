Kimberlyn King-Hinds began her service to the U.S. House of Representatives for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) on January 3, 2025. She is the second person to hold this office and the first woman from the CNMI to represent her people in Congress.

Kimberlyn King-Hinds was born and raised on the island of Tinian, where she developed a deep connection to her community and culture. She holds a Juris Doctor degree, along with a Native Hawaiian Law Certificate, from the William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii. She also earned a Master of Human Resource Management with honors and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Loyola Marymount University.

Congresswoman King-Hinds is committed to addressing the pressing challenges of the Northern Mariana Islands, including strengthening public health, improving infrastructure, advancing education, increasing access to affordable transportation options, and advocating for economic development. Her legal and public service background uniquely positions her to represent the CNMI’s interests in Washington, D.C. Ms. King-Hinds is focused on fostering collaboration across federal, local, and community stakeholders to bring meaningful progress to her constituents.

Before her election to Congress, Ms. King-Hinds demonstrated leadership in law and public service. She has practiced law for over a decade as a licensed attorney in both Hawaii and the CNMI. Her private legal practice has focused on family law, probate, and civil litigation, and she has served as Legal Counsel for the Tinian Mayor’s Office.

In public service, Ms. King-Hinds held the position of Chair of the Commonwealth Ports Authority, where she led pivotal negotiations, including the Divert lease agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense. She also served as In-House Counsel for the NMI Settlement Fund, ensuring compliance with federal and local regulations governing the government employee pension system.

Ms. King-Hinds’ leadership extends to her tenure as Chair of the Northern Marianas College Board of Regents and her service on the Commonwealth Public Utilities Commission. She has been a steadfast advocate for youth development, domestic violence awareness, and community empowerment through her volunteer work and policy initiatives.

In addition to her professional achievements, Rep. King-Hinds has volunteered extensively, co-chairing initiatives like Friends of San Jose Church Tinian, a nonprofit organization dedicated to rebuilding the historic San Jose Church. Her passion for service and her commitment to justice have been a cornerstone of her career.

Ms. King-Hinds is married and has one child. She is dedicated to ensuring that her work in Congress reflects the needs, aspirations, and resilience of the people of the CNMI.
