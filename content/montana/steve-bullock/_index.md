     greeting: contact Governor Steve Bullock 
     description: Steve Bullock, Montana’s former attorney general, was elected Montana’s 24th governor on November 6, 2012. Born and raised in Montana, Steve has spent his career fighting on behalf of workers, students and families. As governor, he works to make Montana stronger for future generations, ensuring that his own three kids – and all young Montanans – are able to enjoy the same opportunities afforded to all of us who grew up here. Governor Bullock was born in Missoula and raised in Helena. He attended public schools in Helena and graduated from Helena High School in 1984. He received his undergraduate degree from Claremont McKenna College and his law degree with honors from Columbia University Law School in New York.
