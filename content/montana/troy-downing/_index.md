Republican Congressman Troy Downing is currently serving his first term as the United States Representative for Montana’s Second Congressional District. 

A proud Montanan, Congressman Downing began his career as an educator, spending time at New York University’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences as a research scientist and teacher in NYU’s IT department before leaving higher education to found a technology startup company that would later merge with Yahoo! Inc. Following this successful venture, Downing’s passion for entrepreneurship saw him helping other startups through mentorship and angel financing. 

When America faced its darkest hour following the terror attacks of September 11th, 2001, Congressman Downing rushed to enlist. He joined the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard, ultimately serving eight years with a Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) squadron including two tours of duty to Afghanistan. While there, Downing ventured beyond the wire numerous times to rescue wounded soldiers on the battlefield. If he wasn’t forward deployed or on alert, Congressman Downing could be found volunteering in the U.S. military hospital in Kandahar or on outreach missions in-country. The CSAR motto, “these things we do, that others may live,” guided Congressman Downing in combat. He brings the same service-first mentality to the halls of Congress and is still actively engaged with multiple Montana-based veterans’ organizations. 

Following his military service, Congressman Downing would return to the private sector where he founded, among various other ventures and small businesses, a nationwide insurance company in addition to a commercial real estate firm.  

Most recently, Congressman Downing served as Montana State Auditor where he was tasked with oversight of Montana’s insurance and securities industries. Downing leveraged his experience in the private sector to engage with complex insurance and securities regulation, working to defend state residents from fraud, lower costs for families, and promote economic development. Under Congressman Downing’s leadership, industry thrived, rates stayed low, and consumers were protected, all to the benefit of everyday Montanans. 

As one of five statewide elected posts, the Montana State Auditor serves an additional role as a member of the Board of Land Commissioners, a responsibility that saw Congressman Downing work to increase access to public lands and promote natural resources development. Guided by the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, Downing voted to approve timber sales, oil and gas leases, and agricultural projects in an effort to do right by Montana’s farmers, grow the state’s economy, and unleash American energy. 

Congressman Downing is one of the newest members of the House Financial Services Committee and House Committee on Small Business. Downing’s extensive business and regulatory experience will prove invaluable as he looks to help House Republicans expand access to capital for rural small businesses, create clear rules of the road for digital assets, support and strengthen Montana community banks, bring back American energy dominance, secure the border, and hold China accountable. 

He resides in Helena, Montana with his wife, Heather. They have four grown children.
