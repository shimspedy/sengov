Tim Sheehy is a father, husband, combat veteran, patriot, and an entrepreneur. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy class of 2008 with a B.S. in History, Tim completed several deployments and hundreds of missions as a US Navy SEAL Officer and Team Leader, deploying to Iraq, Afghanistan, South America, and the Pacific region. Tim was honored to serve alongside many American heroes and was involved in dozens of engagements with enemy forces, earning him multiple combat decorations. Additionally, Tim completed a joint tour with Army Special Operations forces where he was privileged to complete US Army Ranger School and serve alongside the 5th Special Forces Group, 75th Ranger Regiment and other units within US Army Special Operations Command. Tim completed his active duty service as a mini submarine pilot and navigator specializing in sensitive undersea operations. After his active duty service, Tim fulfilled reserve duty as a recruiter and assessor for future naval officers. Tim was honorably discharged from the Naval Reserve in 2019.

In 2014, Tim founded Belgrade-based Bridger Aerospace with all of his savings and an all-veteran team. Under Tim’s leadership, Bridger Aerospace and its sister company, Ascent Vision Technologies experienced rapid growth and created hundreds of Montana jobs. Ascent Vision Technologies was acquired by CACI in 2020, and Bridger Aerospace went public on the NASDAQ in 2023. Today, Bridger Aerospace is a major Montana employer and one of only a few publicly traded companies in the state. In addition to founding Bridger Aerospace, Sheehy was an active firefighting pilot, completing hundreds of firefighting missions across the American West, protecting communities from devastation as a pilot of the CL415EAF Water Bomber and before that, as an Air Attack pilot in the AC690 Twin Commander. Tim remains a qualified FAA Commercial Pilot and a Certified Flight Instructor.

Tim has also been the co-owner of a working cattle ranch and a cattle feeder operation, Little Belt Cattle Company and Yellowstone Cattle Feeders. Tim believes in strengthening America’s food supply chain.

#### Family 

Tim met his wife, Carmen, who served as a U.S. Marine Corps Officer, at the Naval Academy. Together, they share four beautiful and healthy children. Tim and Carmen believe strongly in giving back, and thanks to the success of their businesses, they have donated millions in supporting pediatric health care improvement, neonatal intensive care, and helping establish Montana’s first Level I Trauma Center, among other philanthropic causes. The Sheehy’s live in southwest Montana and feel blessed to teach their kids about Montana’s proud tradition of cattle ranching on their veteran-led working cattle ranch. For fun Tim enjoys roping calves, riding with his family, skiing, backpacking and aviation.

#### U.S. Senate: 

Tim was elected to serve the people of Montana in the U.S. Senate on November 5, 2024. Tim is committed to serving Montana by fighting for a strong economy, a secure border, American strength on the world stage, and greater opportunity for all Montanans.
