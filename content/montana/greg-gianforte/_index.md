Gianforte spent his entire career focusing on creating jobs and opportunities. He founded five different startup companies. He’s worked to improve Montana’s economy through the “Better Montana Jobs” project. He also launched scholarship programs to help low-income students and veterans pursue the education and training they need to start a career in Montana.
