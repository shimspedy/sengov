Congressman Jeff Hurd is a Colorado native who grew up in Grand Junction. His first job was bagging groceries at the local grocery store before pursuing higher education. He earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of Notre Dame. He later attended the University of Denver Law School. He went on to serve as a law clerk to federal appeals court judge Timothy M. Tymkovich. Jeff then received an LLM at Columbia Law School before practicing at an international law firm in New York City.

After returning home to western Colorado with his wife, Barbora, and their children, Jeff built a successful law practice focused on serving rural communities—much of his work centered on representing rural electric co-ops across the state.

Jeff is honored to represent Colorado’s Third District, widely regarded as the nation’s most beautiful district. It spans from world-renowned ski resorts like Telluride and Aspen to the historic farming and ranching communities of the San Luis Valley. The district is home to Pueblo, the oldest steel mill west of the Mississippi. Mesa County contains the famous Colorado National Monument, Dominguez and Escalante National Conservation Area, and the Uncompahgre and Grand Mesa National Forests.

The Third District is home to the second-largest natural gas basin in the United States. Colorado’s Third District coal mines support 6,858 jobs and rate the eighth-highest coal reserves in the nation, producing 12.4 million tons in 2023.

As a member of Congress, Jeff Hurd is a champion for Western values which supports Colorado’s energy independence, water rights, and a rural way of life. He serves on the House Committee on Natural Resources, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.

As Daniel Webster once said… “Let us develope the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.”
