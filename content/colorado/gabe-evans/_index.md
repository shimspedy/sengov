Congressman Gabe Evans is proudly serving Colorado’s Eighth Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives, which includes most of Adams County, Weld County north to and including Greeley, and part of Larimer County including Berthoud. 

Gabe comes to Congress eager to make Colorado the best possible place to live and raise a family. 

Prior to serving in public office, Gabe served his country in the U.S. Army, the Colorado Army National Guard as a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot and company commander, and as an Arvada police officer. 

Gabe spent twelve years in the Army, where he completed a combat deployment to the Middle East and served in Operation Enduring Freedom, ultimately reaching the rank of Captain. 

In the Colorado Army National Guard, Gabe was stationed at Buckley Air Force Base where he served as a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot and company commander responding to wildfires and search and rescues throughout Colorado. In 2011, Gabe joined the Arvada Police Department, where he reached the rank of Lieutenant before retiring to run for public office in 2022.

In 2022, he was elected to serve Colorado House District 48, which he faithfully served before being elected to Congress in 2024. 

The grandson of Mexican immigrants, Gabe is a Colorado native who truly understands the beauty and responsibility of the American Dream. Preserving that sacred ideal for his community and children is why he served in the military, raised his hand for law enforcement, was elected to the Colorado State House, and now works to represent Colorado’s Eighth Congressional District well in Washington, D.C. 

Gabe and his wife, Anne, own and operate a family farm in southern Weld County where they raise their two boys.
