Born in Leavenworth, Kansas in 1954, Doug had service-before-self instilled in him at an early age by his father, a World War II combat veteran and a corrections officer at the Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary.

After meeting his wife Jeanie, Doug graduated from the University of Kansas with a Journalism Degree (as a National Merit Scholar). As they began to raise their five children, Doug worked hard to put himself through law school, earning a law degree from the University of Kansas before moving his family to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to practice business and real estate law.

In Colorado, Doug was called to public office and served in the Colorado General Assembly from 1995 to 2006, in both the State House and State Senate. During his time in the Colorado Legislature, Doug was elected Senate President Pro-Tem, served as Chairman of the Senate State Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, Chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus, and House Majority Whip.
 

Doug was the lead sponsor of the largest tax cut in Colorado history. Doug also introduced legislation creating a license plate honoring Bronze Star recipients, exempting active-duty soldiers from paying state income taxes, allowing public school students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, eliminating and reducing state services to illegal immigrants, banning late-term abortions, implementing DNA testing of convicted felons, eliminating the sales tax on telephone service, eliminating the business personal property tax for thousands of businesses, and repealing expired and outdated laws. Many of these efforts successfully became law. While serving in the part-time Colorado General Assembly, Doug continued to practice law and raise a family. 

Doug was then elected to the US House of Representatives in 2006 to represent Colorado's Fifth District. Colorado's Fifth District, based in Colorado Springs, is one of our nation's most military-intensive congressional districts and the home to more than 100,000 veterans who have served our country with distinction and honor. Because of the district's military and veteran concentration, Doug serves as a high-ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee and a former member for ten years of the Veterans Affairs Committee. In these roles, he has protected important national defense funding, programs, and missions and has fought hard for the right of veterans to receive the healthcare they have earned. Additionally, the Congressman has worked since his first day in office to bring about a dignified and fitting National Veterans Cemetery to the Pikes Peak Region, which is now completed.

Additionally, Doug currently serves as the Ranking Member of the Readiness Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. The Readiness Subcommittee is responsible for the single largest account with DOD's budget. It oversees military readiness, training, logistics, maintenance issues and programs, military construction, installations, and family housing issues. The subcommittee makes sure that our troops and their loved ones receive the first-class benefits they deserve. Doug also serves on the Strategic Forces subcommittee, which oversees our nation's nuclear weapons, ballistic missile defense, national security space programs, and Department of Energy national security programs, ensuring that our nation is properly prepared for any missile or nuclear attacks.

Doug also serves on the House Natural Resources Committee and its subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, and the Energy and Mineral Resources subcommittee. The Subcommittee on Federal Lands is responsible for all matters related to the National Park System, U.S. Forests, public lands, and national monuments. The Energy and Mineral Resources subcommittee oversees public resources on public lands, including offshore energy development.
 

Throughout his time in public service, Doug has been a leader on pro-family and small business issues, a strong advocate for our veterans and our military, and a supporter of lower taxes, immigration reform, less government spending, and protection of the Second Amendment.

Doug is married to Jeanie, his wife of 45 years and an accomplished artist and former teacher at the Bemis School of Art in Colorado Springs. The Lamborn's have also raised five extremely successful children. Their four sons were Eagle Scouts and, among them, have served as a doctor, in the military, as an attorney, and as a member of the film industry in Los Angeles. Their daughter was an accomplished Division I track and field athlete and has an advanced degree in creative non-fiction. Three of their children are married, and among them, they have six grandchildren.
