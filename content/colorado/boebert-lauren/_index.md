She serves on the Natural Resources and Oversight Committees, is the Vice Chair of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, is co-chair of the Congressional Second Amendment Caucus, and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus.

Rep. Boebert is also a member of the Congressional Western Caucus where she focuses on issues that impact rural Colorado like energy, agriculture, multiple-use on public lands and water.

A 38-year-old, citizen legislator who lives in Windsor, Colorado, she never held public office prior to her 2020 victory and is now the senior Republican member of Colorado's Congressional Delegation.

Congresswoman Boebert was the proud owner of Shooter's Grill, a Second Amendment and Western-themed restaurant in Rifle, Colorado where staff open-carried.

Congresswoman Boebert is active in her church and spent years as a volunteer, counseling and assisting at-risk women at the local jail with reentering society and becoming contributing members in their communities.

She worked in the domestic energy sector as a natural gas product technician, GIS technician, and pipeline integrity coordinator.

Representative Boebert is the mother of four boys and a grandmother of one.
