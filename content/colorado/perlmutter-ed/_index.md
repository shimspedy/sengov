Ed has deep roots in the 7th Congressional District and has lived in Jefferson County his entire life. His grandfather and father ran a concrete business (in what is now the 7th District) for decades. Ed attended Jefferson County public schools and then worked construction with his father during the summers while in law school at the University of Colorado. He chose to raise his family in the district where his three daughters also attended Jefferson County Public Schools. Ed currently lives in Arvada with his wife Nancy, a public school teacher, who also has three children who attended Jeffco public schools.

In 1994, Ed was elected to the Colorado State Senate as the first Democrat to hold the seat in nearly 30 years. He served two terms and garnered the reputation as a bipartisan bridge-builder and a champion of renewable energy and smart growth policies. In 2006, Ed was first elected to represent the 7th Congressional District in Congress and is currently serving in his seventh term.

Ed remains focused on representing the people of the 7th District and creating policies that give people the opportunity to pursue their own American dream. Ed believes working across the aisle to find common ground is critical for democracy and helps to better represent the individuals and families in his district and in Colorado. Specifically, Ed supports job growth by promoting energy independence by working with the Colorado School of Mines, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and other world-class private sector energy businesses as well as expanding Coloradoâ€™s role and economic development opportunities in the aerospace industry including the Orion manned space flight program and working on a long-term plan to get humans to Mars in 2033.

In the 117th Congress, Ed is proud to serve on four committees in the House: Financial Services; Science, Space and Technology; Rules; and the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. On the Financial Services Committee, Ed serves as Chair of the Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions Subcommittee. Ed is also a member of the New Democrat Coalition which is focused on harnessing American ingenuity and innovation to create new jobs, greater economic prosperity and a safer and more secure future for our country.
