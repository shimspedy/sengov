Elected in 2024, Congressman Jeff Crank proudly represents Colorado’s Fifth Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. 

Jeff, a native Coloradan, was born and raised in southern Colorado. His mother was a teacher’s aide at Goodnight Elementary School in Pueblo. Jeff’s father was a World War II Navy veteran who fought in the Pacific Theater and was at the Battle of Okinawa, and later was a manager for the Pershing II missile program at the Pueblo Army Depot.  

After graduating from Colorado State University with a degree in Political Science, Jeff worked in Washington, D.C. for Representative Joel Hefley from 1991 to 1998, where he focused on military issues and served as the Administrative Director. During this time, Jeff helped author several pieces of legislation, including the Military Family Housing Privatization Act, which privatized hundreds of thousands of housing units at over fifty military installations, providing better quality housing for our military and their families.  

Jeff then moved back home to Colorado to serve as the Vice President for the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce, later becoming the Senior Vice President. He later worked as Chief Operating Officer at Americans for Prosperity and as the president of his own real estate investment company. Jeff also has a background in broadcasting, having hosted both the The Jeff Crank Show in Colorado and the award-winning American Potential Podcast.  

Jeff met his wife, Lisa, while they were both attending Colorado State University. They have been together for over three decades and have two children, Joel and Jessica.

In his spare time, Jeff enjoys pheasant and big game hunting throughout the western United States, often alongside his favorite hunting partners – his children.
