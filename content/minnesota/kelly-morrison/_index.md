Kelly Morrison has spent most of her career as a doctor – not a politician. As an OB-GYN who practiced in Minnesota for over 20 years, Kelly has dedicated her life to helping people. Her husband, John Willoughby, was an Army Ranger, and their family has always valued service above all.

Kelly served for six years in the Minnesota legislature, and developed a track record of working across the aisle to get things done. She passed over 90 bills during her time in the state House and Senate, more than almost every other legislator. She led the fight to protect a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions and took on the big pharmaceutical companies and passed legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs.

And as a mom, Kelly is focused on keeping our kids safe and healthy and has championed efforts to combat gun violence, take on the opioid crisis, strengthen mental health support in schools, fight climate change, and protect our lakes and rivers.

Kelly puts her constituents and their priorities first. She has fought for legislation to strengthen our infrastructure in the Third District, provide resources for our veterans, address racial and geographic disparities in maternal health, improve early childhood education, and support our seniors and caregivers.

Kelly has received numerous awards for her work, including the Paul Wellstone Advocacy Award from the Minnesota Psychiatric Society, the Children’s Health Hero Award from the Minnesota Children’s Hospital, the Legislator of the Year Award from the Minnesota Psychological Association, and was just named the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)'s Legislator of the Year.

Kelly is a 6th-generation Minnesotan who has deep roots in the state and the MN-03 community. Kelly and John live in Deephaven and have three children and two (very good) dogs.
