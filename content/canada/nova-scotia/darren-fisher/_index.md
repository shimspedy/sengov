Sean Simon Andrew Fraser, PC MP, is a prominent Canadian politician and member of the Liberal Party. Born on June 1, 1984, Fraser currently holds the esteemed position of Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship, a role he has assumed since October 26, 2021. He represents the Central Nova constituency in the House of Commons of Canada, having been elected in the 2015 federal election.

Fraser spent his formative years in the picturesque town of Merigomish, located in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. In pursuit of his educational aspirations, he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from St. Francis Xavier University in 2006. Displaying an insatiable thirst for knowledge, he furthered his studies at both Dalhousie University and Leiden University in the Netherlands, where he successfully completed his legal education in 2009.

During his early professional years, Fraser honed his legal expertise by working as an associate at Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP in Calgary for a period of three years. His dedication to the legal field extended beyond Canadian borders, as he also contributed his skills to a non-governmental organization in South Africa, where he engaged in work related to the Promotion of Access to Information Act.

Fraser's exceptional talents and commitment to public service have not gone unnoticed. In recognition of his eloquence and persuasive skills, he was bestowed with the title of "Best Orator" and emerged as a finalist for the prestigious "Rising Star" award during Macleans 12th annual Parliamentarians of the Year ceremony.

Sean Simon Andrew Fraser stands as a testament to the power of determination and a driving force for positive change in Canadian politics. With his fervor for immigration, refugees, and citizenship matters, he continues to shape policies that reflect the values and aspirations of the nation he proudly serves.
