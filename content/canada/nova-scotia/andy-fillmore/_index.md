Peter Alexander Fillmore MP, born on April 25, 1966, is a Canadian Liberal politician renowned for his dedicated service in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the esteemed riding of Halifax since 2015.

Early Life and Education
Peter Fillmore was born in Bloomington, Indiana, to Atlantic Canadian parents who were pursuing their studies in the United States. At the tender age of four, he returned with his family to their ancestral home in Nova Scotia. Growing up in Halifax, he attended various educational institutions including Tower Road School, Halifax Grammar School, Gorsebrook Junior High, and Queen Elizabeth High School. Fillmore initially embarked on his post-secondary journey at Acadia University, pursuing studies in engineering. However, he later transferred to the Technical University of Nova Scotia (now merged with Dalhousie University), where he completed his undergraduate degree in architecture in 1990. Eager to expand his knowledge, Fillmore obtained a graduate degree in urban and rural planning in 1992. His thirst for learning led him to the prestigious Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he earned a graduate degree in Design Studies with a specialization in Urban Design in 1995.

Career
Fillmore's professional career has been focused on urban planning and design. He commenced his journey in Boston, Massachusetts, where he contributed his expertise to the renowned Big Dig project as an urban designer. Subsequently, Fillmore joined the prominent architecture and planning firm, Arrowstreet Inc. His dedication and passion for his craft led him to the role of Town Planner in Cumberland, Maine. Inspired by his experiences, he went on to establish his own architectural design and town planning firm called Interurban Planning & Design. In 2005, he felt the call of his hometown and returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia. There, he made history by becoming the inaugural Manager of Urban Design for the City of Halifax. In this capacity, Fillmore played a pivotal role in the successful implementation of the "HRM by Design" Downtown Halifax Plan. Additionally, he held positions as the Director of the Dalhousie University School of Planning and served as the Vice President of Planning & Development for the Waterfront Development Corporation Limited, a prominent crown corporation dedicated to revitalizing post-industrial waterfronts in Nova Scotia.

As the Member of Parliament for Halifax, Fillmore has assumed numerous additional responsibilities within the House of Commons and the Government of Canada. During the 42nd Canadian Parliament, he was appointed to the all-party Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs in December 2015. Recognizing his capabilities and leadership qualities, Fillmore was elected as the committee's chairman on February 4, 2016, a role he fulfilled until January 2017. In January 2017, he was entrusted with the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Democratic Institutions, Karina Gould. His commitment to public service continued to shine as he assumed the role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Multiculturalism, Pablo Rodriguez, in September 2018. Following his re-election to the House of Commons for the 43rd Canadian Parliament in the October 2019 federal election, Fillmore was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to Canada's Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, Catherine McKenna.
