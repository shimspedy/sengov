Christopher André d'Entremont MP, born on October 31, 1969, is a Canadian politician known for his tenure in the House of Commons representing West Nova since 2019 as a member of the Conservative Party. Prior to his federal political career, he served as the representative for Argyle-Barrington in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2003 to 2019, affiliated with the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservatives. D'Entremont achieved notable distinctions when he was elected as the deputy speaker and chair of Committees of the Whole in 2021 through a secret ballot. He holds the honor of being the first person of Acadian descent to assume the role of deputy speaker and the first Nova Scotian deputy speaker of the House of Commons of Canada since 1916.

Early Life and Career:
Before embarking on his political journey, d'Entremont worked as an announcer at CJLS-FM. Subsequently, he held positions at TriStar Industries as an electronics salesperson and at Camille d'Eon Boatbuilders. He also served as a development officer for the South West Shore Development Authority.

Political Career:
Provincial Politics:
In the 2003 provincial election, d'Entremont was elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Argyle. He successfully secured re-election in the subsequent elections of 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2017. On August 15, 2003, he assumed the role of Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, as well as Minister of Acadian Affairs, as part of the Executive Council of Nova Scotia.[7] D'Entremont later took on the positions of Minister of Health, Minister of Community Services, Minister responsible for the Youth Secretariat, and Chair of the Senior Citizens' Secretariat. During a brief period preceding the passing of Michael Baker on March 2, 2009, he served as the interim Minister of Finance, after which the responsibilities were transferred to Jamie Muir on March 10, 2009.

Federal Politics:
On November 20, 2018, d'Entremont announced his intention to seek the Conservative Party nomination in West Nova for the 2019 federal election. Following a successful nomination victory on June 22, 2019,[14] he resigned from his provincial seat on July 31, 2019.[15] Consequently, d'Entremont emerged victorious in the general election held on October 21, 2019, winning the seat for Member of Parliament in West Nova by defeating the Liberal candidate Jason Deveau. Notably, he became the sole non-Liberal MP from Nova Scotia[16] and represented the easternmost riding among the Conservatives elected in the 2019 federal election.

In 2019, Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party, appointed d'Entremont as the Shadow Minister of Official Languages and as a member of the Standing Committee on Official Languages. Additionally, he served as the Shadow Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs in Erin O'Toole's Shadow Cabinet. D'Entremont also held a position as a member of the Standing Committee on Health.

On September 20, 2021, d'Entremont was successfully re-elected as the Member of Parliament for West Nova.

Personal Life:
On May 20, 1995, d'Entremont married Anne d'Entremont (née Muise) in Ste. Anne du Ruisseau, Nova Scotia. The couple has been blessed with two sons: André (born in 1998) and Alec (born in 2002).
