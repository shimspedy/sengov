Richard J. "Dick" Cannings MP, born on March 31, 1954, is a Canadian biologist, author, and politician. He has made significant contributions in both the field of biology and the realm of politics. Cannings was elected as the Member of Parliament for South Okanagan—West Kootenay in the 2015 Canadian federal election as a representative of the New Democratic Party (NDP), and he was re-elected in 2019.

During his time in the 42nd Canadian Parliament, Cannings demonstrated his commitment to various causes by sponsoring three private member's bills. The first bill aimed to promote the use of wood in federal public works projects, highlighting the importance of sustainable practices. The second bill sought to extend the protection of various lakes and rivers under the Navigable Waters Protection Act. Lastly, he introduced a bill urging the Minister of Environment to address the recommendations made in a report by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Cannings held important positions within the NDP, serving as the Critic for Post-Secondary Education and Deputy Critic for Natural Resources.

Throughout his political career, Cannings showed adaptability and a willingness to take on new responsibilities. In 2016, he transitioned to the role of NDP Critic for Natural Resources, a position he held until 2021. In October 2021, he assumed the role of NDP Critic for Emergency Preparedness (Climate Adaptation) and Critic for Small Business and Tourism. Additionally, he served as the Deputy Critic for Natural Resources and Deputy Critic for Innovation, Science, and Industry. His expertise in science and research was recognized when he was appointed as an inaugural member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Science and Research in December 2021.

Before entering politics, Cannings pursued a successful career in biology. He followed in the footsteps of his father, Stephen Cannings, a renowned environmentalist, and shared a passion for biology with his twin brother Sydney and older brother Rob. Richard obtained a master's degree in zoology from Memorial University of Newfoundland and taught at the University of British Columbia for 17 years. He also worked as a consulting biologist in Penticton, his hometown, and contributed to the non-profit organization Bird Studies Canada. Cannings actively participated in wildlife conservation efforts, serving as co-chair for Birds on the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada for eight years. He also dedicated his time to the B.C. Environmental Appeal Board and the B.C. Forest Appeals Commission, serving for 11 and five years, respectively. As a board member of the Nature Conservancy of Canada from 2006 to 2015, Cannings demonstrated his commitment to preserving Canada's natural heritage.

Cannings's passion for birds and nature extended beyond his scientific work. He authored or contributed to numerous books, many of which focused on birds and natural history. Notably, in collaboration with his brothers, he co-authored "Birds of the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia," published by the Royal British Columbia Museum. His memoir-style book of essays, "An Enchantment of Birds: Memories From A Birder's Life," was published in 2007, and he edited "Flights of Imagination: Extraordinary Writing about Birds" in 2010. Together with his son Russell, Cannings contributed to "Birdfinding in British Columbia" and "Best Places to Bird in British Columbia."

Cannings's political journey began in 2012 when he sought the British Columbia New Democratic Party nomination for the Penticton riding in the provincial election. Although he did not win, he remained determined and ran for the federal NDP nomination in the South Okanagan—West Kootenay riding for the subsequent federal election. In the 2015 general election, Cannings emerged victorious, securing the riding with 37% of the vote. Throughout his parliamentary tenure, he continued to champion environmental issues and fight for sustainable practices.

In the 2019 federal election, Cannings successfully defended his seat in the South Okanagan—West Kootenay riding, facing competition from candidates representing the Conservative Party, Green Party, People's Party, and Liberal Party.

Richard J. "Dick" Cannings MP is a dedicated biologist, accomplished author, and committed politician, leaving a lasting impact in the fields of science and governance.
