Political Career
Gord Johns, born on November 29, 1969, is a Canadian businessman and politician who has made significant contributions to public service. Since 2015, he has been the New Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) representing the federal electoral riding of Courtenay—Alberni in the House of Commons of Canada.

Before entering federal politics, Gord Johns served as a town councillor for Tofino, British Columbia, where he actively participated in local governance. He also demonstrated his entrepreneurial skills by founding several small businesses. Notably, he opened a store specializing in sustainable products in Tofino, which he successfully ran for 13 years. He expanded his business ventures by opening additional locations called Fiber Options and Eco-Everything in Victoria and Whistler. Furthermore, Gord Johns owned and operated the Cedar Corner Art Gallery in Tofino for several years, showcasing local artwork. Unfortunately, due to market downturns, his stores were unable to sustain profitability and closed their doors in 2010. During this period, alongside running his businesses, Gord Johns raised three children and served one term as a municipal councillor for the District of Tofino from 2008 to 2011.

Following his tenure as a municipal councillor, Gord Johns assumed the role of executive director of the Tofino-Long Beach Chamber of Commerce, where he worked until his nomination as the New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate in the federal election in 2014. Notably, he volunteered with the West Coast Recreation Society, advocating for the development of a West Coast Multiplex facility to promote recreational opportunities in the region.

In November 2014, Gord Johns secured the NDP nomination for the 2015 federal election, emerging as the preferred candidate over City of Courtenay councillor Ronna-Rae Leonard. During the general election campaign, he faced incumbent John Duncan of the Conservative Party, Parksville councillor Carrie Powell-Davidson of the Liberal Party, Glen Sollitt, a seafood-distribution business owner representing the Green Party, and Barbara Biley from the Marxist-Leninist Party, who worked as a healthcare professional. Initially, Gord Johns was considered a front-runner, but as the campaign progressed, he faced tough competition due to a surge in Green Party support on Vancouver Island and growing Liberal support nationally.

Gord Johns emerged victorious in the 2015 federal election, securing his seat as the MP for Courtenay—Alberni. However, his party, the NDP, became the third party in the House of Commons, with the Liberal Party forming a majority government. Gord Johns wasted no time in establishing his presence and commitment to public service, opening his constituency office in Parksville.

During the 42nd Canadian Parliament, Gord Johns played an active role in parliamentary affairs. Initially appointed by NDP leader Tom Mulcair as the critic for small business and tourism, he continued in this position when Jagmeet Singh became the NDP leader. Singh also added veterans affairs to Gord Johns' portfolio. In his role as the Veterans Affairs critic, Gord Johns successfully moved a motion in the House of Commons, unanimously passed, which called for the government to carry forward all annual lapsed spending at the Department of Veterans Affairs to the next fiscal year. This motion aimed to ensure that veterans receive the support and resources they deserve.

Throughout his tenure, Gord Johns introduced a private member bill, the National Cycling Strategy Act (Bill C-312), during the 42nd Parliament. This bill sought to compel the federal government to develop and implement a strategy to enhance cycling infrastructure and promote road safety through a review of regulations and standards. Gord Johns' commitment to cycling advocacy was further exemplified when he embarked on a 13-day cycling tour of his riding in 2017, promoting active transportation and engaging

 with constituents.

In the 43rd Canadian Parliament, Gord Johns continued to serve as the critic for small business, tourism, and veterans affairs. However, in early 2020, he assumed a new role as the critic for fisheries, oceans, and the Canadian Coast Guard. In this capacity, Gord Johns has been a vocal advocate for sustainable fisheries, the protection of wild Pacific salmon, and reforms in the aquaculture industry. He has called for increased support for fishing communities, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has been critical of the impact of open-net fish farming on wild salmon populations. Gord Johns has also advocated for improvements to fishing quota models and has introduced a private member bill to require closed containment facilities for commercial finfish aquaculture.

Furthermore, Gord Johns has been an active proponent of environmental and climate change issues. He has been a vocal critic of expanding Canada's petroleum exports and the development of bitumen pipelines, emphasizing the need for a transition to renewable energy sources. He has called for a Green New Deal policy, supporting investments in renewable energy and green industries while ensuring a just transition for workers. Gord Johns has also been dedicated to protecting Vancouver Island's old-growth forests, advocating for stronger conservation measures and the preservation of these valuable ecosystems.

Gord Johns' political career has been marked by his commitment to his constituents, his advocacy for social and environmental issues, and his efforts to promote sustainable economic development. As the Member of Parliament for Courtenay—Alberni, he continues to represent his constituents' interests, contributing to the legislative process and striving to make a positive impact on the issues that matter to Canadians.
