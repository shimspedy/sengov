Terry Beech MP, born on April 2, 1981, is a Canadian politician known for his commitment to public service. He entered the political arena as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the federal electoral district of Burnaby North—Seymour during the 2015 Canadian federal election.

Beech's political journey began in 1999 when, at the age of 18, he made history as British Columbia's youngest-ever elected official by winning a seat on the Nanaimo City Council. After serving on the council for three years, he chose not to seek re-election and decided to further his education at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby. There, he pursued a joint major in business and economics, acquiring a solid foundation for his future endeavors. Continuing his educational pursuits, Beech seized the opportunity to study at Oxford University, completing an MBA through their online program.

Following his academic pursuits, Beech ventured into various business and charitable activities. While his early endeavors faced challenges, his unwavering determination and commitment to making a positive impact on society propelled him forward.

In July 2014, Beech's dedication to public service led him to be nominated as the Liberal candidate in the Burnaby North—Seymour electoral district. In October of the same year, he won the election, marking the beginning of his role as a Member of Parliament.

From 2015 to 2017, Beech served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Science, where he actively contributed to advancing scientific research and innovation in Canada. In January 2017, he took on a new role as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coast Guard, demonstrating his commitment to protecting Canada's natural resources. Beech's contributions in this role played a crucial part in the modernization of Canada's Fisheries Act and the development of legislation regarding Marine Protected Areas.

In recognition of his outstanding dedication and service, Beech was awarded Maclean's Magazine's Parliamentarian of the Year for Best Civic Outreach in November 2018. This prestigious accolade reflected his exceptional efforts to engage with constituents and ensure their voices were heard.

Beech's path to public service was shaped by his background and upbringing. Born in Comox, British Columbia, he later moved to Victoria, where he attended Arbutus Junior High School and then Mount Douglas Senior Secondary School. Subsequently, he settled in Nanaimo, attending John Barsby Secondary School. During his time in grade 12, Beech actively participated in community activities, coaching the debate team and serving on the board of the Harewood Community Project Society.

In 2006, Beech and his twin brother, Doug, established Twinbro Local Leaders, a non-profit organization focused on empowering youth and providing them access to post-secondary education, regardless of their social and economic backgrounds. This initiative showcases Beech's commitment to fostering educational opportunities and creating a more inclusive society.

Beech's passion for entrepreneurship and education led him to teach courses on these subjects as an adjunct professor at Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia. Additionally, he played a significant role in redesigning the entrepreneurship program at Simon Fraser University.

As part of his commitment to promoting economic growth and innovation, Beech participated in the Action Canada program in 2010/11, where he co-authored "Fueling Canada's Economic Success: A National Strategy for High-Growth Entrepreneurship." This collaborative effort demonstrated his dedication to shaping policies that support the growth and success of entrepreneurs in Canada.

Throughout his political career, Beech has worked tirelessly to represent the people of Burnaby North—Seymour. In the 2015 Canadian federal election, he triumphed over formidable opponents, including the former Chief Judge of the Provincial Court of British Columbia and a Conservative Party candidate who would go on to become the Mayor of the District of North Vancouver.

In the 2019 Canadian federal election, Beech successfully defended his seat against a comeback attempt by a previous MP and emerged victorious over a controversial candidate who had been dropped by the Conservative Party. His resilience and ability to connect with constituents played a crucial role in securing his re-election.

Beech's dedication to public service was further recognized when he was once again appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and Canadian Coast Guard on December 12, 2019. This position allowed him to continue his efforts in protecting Canada's valuable marine resources.

In addition to his parliamentary duties, Beech assumed the role of Chair of the Federal Liberal Pacific Caucus in February 2020. This appointment further highlighted his commitment to representing the interests of Liberal MPs from British Columbia.

Beech's unwavering dedication to his constituents and his ability to enact positive change were evident once again in the 2021 Canadian federal election. With 39.4% of the vote, he secured his re-election, defeating his NDP challenger.

On December 3, 2021, Beech took on a new role as the Parliamentary Secretary to Chrystia Freeland, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. This appointment showcased his abilities and affirmed his standing as a trusted member of the Liberal Party.

Terry Beech's biography exemplifies a man devoted to public service, driven by a passion for innovation, education, and civic engagement. Through his ongoing efforts, he continues to make a positive impact on the lives of Canadians and shape the future of his constituency.
