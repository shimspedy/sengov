Edward D. "Ed" Fast PC QC MP, born on June 18, 1955, is a Canadian politician with a distinguished career in public service. As a member of the Conservative Party of Canada, Fast has been serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Abbotsford since 2006. His commitment to his constituents and his contributions to Canadian politics have earned him a respected reputation.

Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Ed Fast relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia during his childhood and grew up there. He pursued his higher education at the University of British Columbia, where he obtained his law degree in 1982. After completing his studies, Fast co-founded a law firm, which is now known as Linley Welwood.

Fast's political journey began in 1985 when he was elected as an Abbotsford School Board Trustee, serving two terms. In 1996, he was elected to the Abbotsford City Council, where he dedicated himself to public service for three consecutive 3-year terms. During this period, Fast held significant roles such as Deputy Mayor and Chair of the Parks, Recreation & Culture Commission, leaving a positive impact on the community.

In federal politics, Fast made his mark by winning the 2006 federal election as the Member of Parliament for Abbotsford with an impressive 63.27% of the vote. In his first term, he joined the Standing Committee of Canadian Heritage and the Standing Committee for Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. Fast also held the position of Chair for the B.C. Conservative caucus.

Notably, in 2006, Fast introduced Private Member's Bill C-277, aimed at increasing the maximum sentence for luring a child over the internet for sexual purposes from 5 to 10 years in prison. This bill received royal assent on June 22, 2007, a remarkable achievement considering that only a small percentage of private member's bills become law.

In the 2008 federal election, Fast secured 63.3% of the total votes in Abbotsford, further solidifying his position as a trusted representative. He chaired the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and served as a member of the Copyright Modernization Committee. Fast also played a pivotal role in renaming the Huntingdon border crossing to "Abbotsford-Huntingdon Port of Entry" in May 2010, accurately reflecting the crossing's location while honoring its historical significance.

Fast's accomplishments and dedication led to his appointment as Canada's Minister of International Trade by Prime Minister Stephen Harper in May 2011. He was re-elected with 65% of the popular vote in the 2011 federal election. As Minister of International Trade, Fast was instrumental in overseeing negotiations for the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union, the Canada-China Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments Agreement, and the Canada-South Korea Free Trade Agreement. He also played a key role in implementing the Government of Canada's Global Markets Action Plan and Canada's International Education Strategy.

While serving in the House of Commons, Fast remained committed to advocating for his constituents and addressing social issues. He expressed his anti-abortion stance by supporting Bill C-233, which sought to amend the Criminal Code to restrict access to sex-selective abortion. Fast's voting record and affiliation with Campaign Life Coalition (CLC) further underline his position as an anti-abortion Member of Parliament.

In 2021, Fast voted against Bill C-6, which aimed to criminalize certain aspects of conversion therapy, including its application on children. His vote positioned him among the 63 MPs who opposed the bill.

During his time in opposition, Fast served as the critic to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change in the shadow cabinets of Rona Ambrose and Andrew Scheer during the 42nd Canadian Parliament. After his re-election in 2019, he declined reappointment to Scheer's shadow cabinet. Subsequently, when Erin O'Toole became the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, Fast was appointed as the Finance critic.

In his personal life, Ed Fast has been happily married to his wife Annette for over 40 years. They have four adult daughters and twelve grandchildren. In December 2016, Fast experienced a stroke but made a remarkable recovery.

Throughout his career, Ed Fast has demonstrated unwavering dedication to public service and has been a strong voice for his constituents. His contributions as a Member of Parliament and Minister of International Trade have left a lasting impact on Canadian politics and trade relations.
