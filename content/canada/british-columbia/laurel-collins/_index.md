Laurel Collins MP, born on May 7, 1984, is a Canadian politician renowned for her dedication to public service. In the 2019 Canadian federal election, she earned the trust of her constituents and was elected as the Member of Parliament representing the riding of Victoria in the House of Commons of Canada. However, her journey in politics began even before her tenure in the House of Commons, as she served as a city councillor for the Victoria City Council. Within the New Democratic Party (NDP), she holds the esteemed positions of Critic for the Environment and Climate Change, as well as Deputy Caucus Chair.

Laurel Collins was born in Kispiox, a town nestled in northern British Columbia, as one of three children in her family. Her parents, both school teachers, separated when she was an infant, which led her to relocate frequently throughout the province during her upbringing. She attended elementary school in various locations such as Salt Spring Island, Alert Bay, and Port Hardy. Later on, she pursued her high school education in Sussex, New Brunswick. For her undergraduate studies, Laurel enrolled at the University of King's College and Dalhousie University, both located in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Eager to expand her knowledge, she pursued a master's degree in Human Security and Peacebuilding at Royal Roads University.

Collins' professional journey has been marked by a strong commitment to making a positive impact on society. She worked at Victoria Women in Need, where she designed and managed programs aimed at assisting women who had experienced abuse. Additionally, Laurel played a pivotal role as a co-founder and co-chair of Divest Victoria, a non-profit organization that advocates for divestment from fossil fuels, urging cities to invest in environmentally responsible alternatives. Furthermore, she embarked on a research endeavor concerning climate migration and displacement, collaborating with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Northern Uganda. Her efforts aimed to develop sustainable solutions for internally displaced persons in the aftermath of deadly conflicts.

Between 2014 and 2019, Collins extended her expertise to the academic realm, teaching various courses at the University of Victoria. Her subjects included Social Inequality, Social Justice Studies, Political Sociology, and the Sociology of Genders. In 2015, she co-authored a book entitled "Women, Adult Education, and Leadership in Canada," a significant contribution to the field. Laurel's unwavering commitment and remarkable achievements were acknowledged in 2017 when she received the Victoria Community Leadership Award in Sustainability and Community Building.

Recognized as a formidable force in politics, Collins successfully ran for the position of councillor for the City of Victoria in October 2018, under the banner of the electoral organization Together Victoria. However, her election to the House of Commons in late October 2019 necessitated her resignation from this post. Despite her departure, her dedication to public service endured, and she continued to serve her constituents at the federal level. The byelection to fill her vacant council seat was postponed due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and eventually took place in December 2020, resulting in the election of Stephen Andrew and the defeat of Together Victoria's candidate Stephanie Hardman.

Laurel Collins' unwavering dedication and commitment to her community resonated with the constituents of Victoria, leading to her re-election in the 2021 federal election. Within the NDP, she holds key positions as the Critic for the Environment and Climate Change, advocating for sustainable practices and policies. Additionally, she serves as the Deputy Critic for Families, Children, and Social Development, demonstrating her commitment to supporting vulnerable populations and fostering a fair society. Through her continued efforts, Laurel Collins remains a prominent figure in Canadian politics, striving to create a better and more inclusive future for all.
