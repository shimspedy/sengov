Taleeb Farouk Noormohamed MP, born on October 8, 1976, is a Canadian politician and technology executive currently serving as the member of Parliament (MP) for Vancouver Granville since 2021, representing the Liberal Party.

Education and Career:
Noormohamed earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Princeton University, followed by a master's degree from Harvard University. He further pursued his doctoral studies at Oxford University under the guidance of his advisor, Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison. During his time at Princeton, Noormohamed wrote about Toni Morrison in the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education and penned a letter about her to Time magazine.

After completing his education, Noormohamed embarked on a career in public service. He worked for the federal government, initially at the Privy Council Office and later at Public Safety Canada, where he held the position of director for the review of the bombing of Air India Flight 182. His dedication to public service led him to become the Director of Partnerships for the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver.

Following the Olympics, the Government of British Columbia appointed Noormohamed to conduct a review of the province's service delivery model. His review identified areas for improvement, but unfortunately, a significant portion of the report was redacted by the provincial government.

From 2011 until his election in 2021, Noormohamed held senior executive roles in various technology firms, including Farfetch and VRBO. Additionally, he served on the board of directors for the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) from 2018 to 2021.

Noormohamed is actively involved in several organizations and institutions. He serves as a governor of the Confederation Centre of the Arts and as an advisory board member of the MacEachen Institute of Public Policy. Furthermore, he has contributed his time and expertise to organizations such as Covenant House Vancouver, The Lions Gate Hospital Foundation, the Koerner Foundation, and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

Acknowledging his commitment to public service, Noormohamed has been honored with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal and the Sovereign's Medal for Volunteers.

Political Career:
Noormohamed's political journey began in the 2011 federal election, where he ran as the Liberal candidate in North Vancouver but was unsuccessful. He made another attempt in the 2019 federal election, this time as the Liberal candidate in Vancouver Granville. However, he faced defeat against incumbent Jody Wilson-Raybould, who ran as an independent candidate despite being elected as a Liberal.

In 2018, Noormohamed announced his candidacy for the leadership of Vision Vancouver, a municipal political party. His victory would have made him the party's mayoral candidate in the municipal elections. During his campaign, he emphasized the party's inclusive nature and his experience in the startup industry. Unfortunately, due to health reasons, Noormohamed had to withdraw from the race and instead threw his support behind another candidate.

Noormohamed made a political comeback during the 2021 federal election, once again running as the Liberal candidate in Vancouver Granville. His candidacy faced initial criticism regarding his property transactions, but he addressed concerns by explaining that the purchases were initially intended for family members or himself and had to be sold due to unforeseen circumstances. However, subsequent reports revealed his involvement in real estate speculation, raising further scrutiny. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged to introduce measures to curb flipping and speculation, and Noormohamed stated that he followed the appropriate rules in his real estate dealings.

As the first Muslim MP to be elected in British Columbia, Noormohamed brings a unique perspective to Parliament. He is an active member of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security (SECU) and the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations (REGS). Additionally, he serves as the chair of the Liberal's Pacific Caucus, contributing to the party's regional representation.
