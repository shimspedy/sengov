Jenny Wai Ching Kwan MP (Chinese: 關慧貞; born 1967) is a Canadian politician and member of Parliament (MP) for Vancouver East. She has been an influential figure in Canadian politics, representing the New Democratic Party (NDP). Kwan's journey in public service began in 1993 when she was elected to the Vancouver City Council, making her the youngest-ever council member at the age of 26. Her dedication and commitment to serving her constituents led her to become a prominent political figure in British Columbia.

Born in British Hong Kong, Kwan emigrated to Canada with her family at the age of nine. Her multilingual abilities in English, French, and Cantonese have greatly contributed to her ability to connect with diverse communities.

Kwan earned a Bachelor of Arts in Criminology from Simon Fraser University before embarking on her career as a community legal advocate in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Her work in this capacity allowed her to witness firsthand the challenges faced by marginalized individuals and motivated her to pursue a career in politics as a means of effecting positive change.

In 1996, Kwan transitioned to provincial politics and was elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant, representing East Vancouver. Her election came at a critical time for the New Democratic Party, following Premier Mike Harcourt's resignation amidst fundraising scandals. Kwan's dedication and political acumen enabled her to secure re-election in subsequent years, with victories in 2005, 2009, and 2013.

Kwan's political career was not without its share of controversies. In December 2010, she called for a leadership convention within the NDP, criticizing then-leader Carole James after the party suffered defeat in the 2009 election. Although some accused Kwan of self-interest, she maintained that she had no intentions of running for the party leadership.

Another significant controversy involving Kwan arose in March 2014 when an audit revealed that her ex-husband, Dan Small, had improperly expensed a family trip to Disneyland through the Portland Hotel Society. Kwan promptly held a press conference, expressing her lack of knowledge about the society covering the trip's costs, and committed to reimbursing the society. She took a temporary leave of absence during this period.

In January 2015, Kwan announced her intention to seek the NDP nomination for Vancouver East in the federal election later that year. She successfully secured the nomination and was elected to the House of Commons in October 2015, defeating her opponents by a significant margin. As an MP, Kwan has been a staunch advocate for her constituents, focusing on immigration, refugees, and citizenship issues. Her expertise in these areas led to her appointment as the NDP's critic for immigration, refugees, and citizenship in November 2015.

Kwan's dedication to public service and her unwavering commitment to her constituents were once again evident in the 2019 federal election when she was re-elected as the MP for Vancouver East. Her continued efforts in representing her community and addressing their concerns have solidified her position as a respected and influential political figure.

In a recent development, on May 12, 2023, it was reported that Kwan was approached by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service regarding a meeting concerning threats made by Chinese diplomats. This incident underscores the challenges and responsibilities faced by politicians, particularly those dealing with sensitive international matters.

Jenny Wai Ching Kwan's journey from a young council member to a prominent Member of Parliament reflects her unwavering commitment to public service and making a positive impact on the lives of Canadians. Her story serves as an inspiration to those who strive to create meaningful change through dedicated political engagement.
