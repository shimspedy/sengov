Tracy Gray is a Canadian politician and member of the Conservative Party of Canada who has dedicated her career to public service. She was elected to represent the riding of Kelowna—Lake Country in the House of Commons of Canada in both the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections. With a passion for her community and a drive for positive change, Gray has been an active voice in Parliament.

Before entering politics, Gray established herself in the British Columbia liquor industry, where she held senior managerial positions at various breweries and wineries in the Okanagan Valley. Notably, she played a key role at Mission Hill Winery, leading the Retail and Hospitality department when the winery received the prestigious International Wine and Spirit Competition Avery Trophy for Best Chardonnay in the World. Her expertise and dedication to promoting local British Columbia wines led her to launch a successful chain of VQA wine stores in the province.

Gray's commitment to entrepreneurship and business development extended beyond her own ventures. She shared her knowledge and experiences by guest lecturing at the University of British Columbia Okanagan and Okanagan College, focusing on entrepreneurship, and became an advocate and mentor for women in business. Additionally, Gray hosted a wine lifestyle segment on Global Okanagan and served as a judge in international wine competitions.

In recognition of her contributions to regional economic development, Gray served as a director on the Okanagan Film Commission, promoting the film and animation industry in the area. She also held positions on the boards of Prospera Credit Union and the Kelowna Chamber of Commerce, actively participating in the growth and success of local businesses.

Gray's political career began when she was elected as a Kelowna City Councillor in 2014. During her tenure, she chaired the Okanagan Basin Water Board, where she spearheaded initiatives to mitigate floods and prevent the spread of invasive Quagga mussels. Her advocacy led to increased funding for conservation officers and additional boat inspection stations to address the invasive species issue. Gray also served as a Trustee on the Okanagan Regional Library board and as a director on the Central Okanagan Regional District board.

In 2018, Gray decided to transition to federal politics. She sought and won the federal Conservative nomination for the electoral district of Kelowna—Lake Country. In the subsequent federal election, she defeated the Liberal incumbent and became the first woman to be elected as a Member of Parliament for the riding. Gray's dedication and commitment to her constituents earned her a place in the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet, where she served as Shadow Minister for Interprovincial Trade and later as Shadow Minister for Export Promotion and International Trade.

As a Member of Parliament, Gray has been a strong advocate for various issues affecting her community and the country as a whole. She successfully passed a motion to establish the Special Committee on the Economic Relationship between Canada and the United States, aimed at studying trade matters between the two countries. Gray has also been an active voice for completing the Okanagan Rail Trail and expanding passport services in the Okanagan region.

While Gray has championed many causes, her stance on certain issues has drawn attention. She voted against a bill prohibiting conversion therapy but supported an updated bill that eventually banned conversion therapy in Canada. The Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada has identified Gray as anti-abortion, and she voted in favor of a bill that sought to amend the Criminal Code regarding sex-selective abortions.

In the 44th Parliament, Gray introduced a Private Member's Bill, the End the Revolving Door Act, which aimed to address addiction treatment and mental health issues for federal inmates by allowing penitentiaries to be used as treatment facilities. Despite receiving support from multiple parties, the bill was defeated at the second reading. Gray has also tabled a Private Member's Motion to recognize November as 'National Adoption Awareness Month,' drawing from her own experience as an adopted person.

Tracy Gray's dedication to public service, her background in the liquor industry, and her entrepreneurial spirit have shaped her political career. Through her work in Parliament, she continues to advocate for her constituents and address important issues impacting her community and the nation as a whole.
