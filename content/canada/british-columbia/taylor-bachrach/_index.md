Taylor Bachrach MP, born in 1978, is a Canadian New Democratic Party (NDP) politician known for his dedicated service in the House of Commons of Canada. He represents the electoral district of Skeena—Bulkley Valley, having been elected in the 2019 Canadian federal election. With a passion for public service, Bachrach has a strong background in municipal politics and community engagement.

Before entering federal politics, Bachrach served as the esteemed mayor of Smithers, British Columbia from 2011 to 2019. During his tenure, he effectively represented the interests of the local community and successfully implemented various initiatives to enhance the town's development. Prior to his mayoral position, Bachrach contributed to the Village of Telkwa as a municipal councillor from 2008 to 2011, displaying his commitment to fostering positive change at the grassroots level.

Beyond his political career, Bachrach established himself as a skilled communicator and entrepreneur. He owned Bachrach Communications, a communications business, which allowed him to utilize his expertise in effectively conveying messages and connecting with people. Furthermore, Bachrach served as the director of communications for the British Columbia chapter of the Sierra Club of Canada, demonstrating his dedication to environmental advocacy and sustainable practices.

In his personal life, Bachrach finds joy and fulfillment with his wife, Michelle, and their two daughters. They reside in Smithers, where they actively participate in the community and contribute to its vibrant social fabric.

Within the NDP, Bachrach has assumed significant roles to contribute to the party's vision and goals. Following his election in 2019, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh appointed him as the party's critic for Infrastructure and Communities in the 43rd Canadian Parliament. Recognizing his expertise and commitment, Bachrach was re-elected in the 2021 Canadian federal election and subsequently took on the responsibilities of critic for Transport and deputy critic for Infrastructure and Communities.

A notable achievement in Bachrach's federal political career was his introduction of Bill C-210, the Right to Vote at 16 Act, on December 13, 2021. This bill proposed an amendment to the Canada Elections Act, advocating for a reduction of the federal voting age in Canada from 18 to 16 years old. Through this initiative, Bachrach aimed to empower young Canadians and foster their active participation in the democratic process.

Taylor Bachrach MP continues to serve diligently in the House of Commons, striving to make a positive impact on his constituency and contribute to the advancement of Canada as a whole.
