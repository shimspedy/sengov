Rachel A. Blaney MP, born on September 18, 1974, is a Canadian politician who currently serves as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons, representing the federal electoral district of North Island—Powell River. She has been an active member of the New Democratic Party (NDP) and has held her position since the 2015 Canadian federal election, where she was elected to the 42nd Parliament. She was re-elected in the 2019 election to the 43rd Parliament.

Blaney's political career has been characterized by her commitment to addressing key issues affecting her constituents. In the 42nd Parliament, she served as the NDP's critic for multiculturalism before transitioning to the roles of critic for seniors issues and veteran affairs. During this period, she introduced two important bills. The first bill, titled "An Act to amend the Canadian Bill of Rights (right to housing)" (Bill C-325), aimed to incorporate the right to proper housing without unreasonable barriers into the Canadian Bill of Rights. Although the bill was defeated at the second reading, it shed light on the urgent need for improved housing rights. The second bill, "An Act to amend the Old Age Security Act (monthly guaranteed income supplement)," sought to assist recipients of the guaranteed income supplement in filing yearly taxes. Blaney's dedication to advocating for vulnerable populations was evident in her legislative efforts.

In the 43rd Parliament, Blaney assumed the role of NDP whip while continuing to serve as the critic for veteran affairs. She introduced one bill, "An Act to establish National Food Waste Awareness Day and to provide for the development of a national strategy to reduce food waste in Canada" (Bill C-283). This bill aimed to combat food waste and promote awareness by creating a national strategy to reduce waste and designating October 16 as "National Food Waste Awareness Day." Although the bill did not progress beyond the first reading, it showcased Blaney's commitment to sustainable practices and environmental conservation.

Born and raised in Terrace, British Columbia, Blaney was adopted into a Stellat'en First Nation family. She later moved to Nanaimo, where she pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in First Nation studies at Malaspina University-College. In 1998, she settled in Campbell River, where she married and raised three children. Prior to entering politics, Blaney worked with the Homalco First Nation and served as the executive director of the Immigrant Welcome Centre of North Vancouver Island, which later became the Multicultural and Immigrant Services Association of North Vancouver Island.

Blaney's political journey began in 2014 when she sought the NDP candidacy for the North Island—Powell River riding. She campaigned vigorously and won the party's nomination, eventually triumphing in the general election against candidates from the Conservative, Liberal, and Green parties. Throughout her tenure as an MP, Blaney has been actively engaged with her constituents, hosting public meetings on various topics and collaborating with fellow MPs to address issues of importance.

In addition to her political endeavors, Blaney has faced challenges, including being named a defendant in a defamation lawsuit in 2017. Despite these hurdles, she remained steadfast in her commitment to public service and continued to work tirelessly to represent the interests of her constituents.

Her commitment to the party's values and goals has been evident in her various roles, including her position as critic for veterans affairs.

Beyond her legislative work, Blaney has made significant contributions to her community. Prior to entering politics, she served as the executive director of the Immigrant Welcome Centre of North Vancouver Island, working to support immigrants and foster multicultural understanding. Her experience in this role has enriched her understanding of diverse cultures and the importance of inclusivity.

As a Member of Parliament representing the North Island—Powell River district, Blaney has consistently demonstrated her dedication to social justice, environmental sustainability, and the well-being of her constituents. Her efforts to address housing rights, support seniors, advocate for veterans, and combat food waste reflect her commitment to creating a fairer and more equitable society.
