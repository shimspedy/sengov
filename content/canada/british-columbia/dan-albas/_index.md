Dan Albas MP (born December 1, 1976) is a Canadian politician and member of the Conservative Party. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2011 election, representing the electoral district of Central Okanagan—Similkameen—Nicola. Albas has been actively involved in politics and public service throughout his career.

Born in 1976, Albas grew up in Penticton, British Columbia, where he was raised by his father, a lawyer involved in conservative politics, and his mother, a social worker. After a brief period in Whitehorse, Yukon, the family moved to Alberta for medical treatment following a severe accident that left Dan with severe burns. They later returned to Penticton, where Albas attended Penticton Secondary School and Okanagan University College.

In the late 1990s, Albas opened his own martial arts studio, Kick City Martial Arts, which later became Premier Martial Arts. He was recognized as the 2005 young entrepreneur of the year by the Penticton and Wine Country Chamber of Commerce. Albas also served on the Chamber of Commerce and represented the region on the British Columbia Chamber of Commerce, playing a role in merging independent Chambers of Commerce in the area.

Albas has been actively involved in his community, running the regional United Way fundraising campaign in 2007 and 2010. He also advocated for affordable housing as a member of the Penticton Housing Coalition and served as a director at the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen, where he successfully reduced the Regional District's contribution to the Okanagan Film Commission by 50%.

In federal politics, Albas entered the Conservative Party nomination election in 2011 following Stockwell Day's retirement as the MP for Okanagan—Coquihalla. He won the nomination and went on to win the 2011 federal election, representing the Okanagan—Coquihalla riding. In the 41st Canadian Parliament, Albas served on the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. He introduced a private members bill, known as Bill C-311, which aimed to amend the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act to allow interprovincial importation of wine for personal use.

In the 42nd Canadian Parliament, Albas won re-election and served as the critic of interprovincial trade before being reassigned as the deputy critic of finance. He endorsed Maxime Bernier in the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. In the 43rd Canadian Parliament, Albas was appointed as the Opposition Critic for Environment and Climate Change.

Throughout his career, Dan Albas has been dedicated to serving his constituents and advocating for issues important to his community.
