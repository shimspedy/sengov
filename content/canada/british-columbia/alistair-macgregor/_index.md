Alistair Bruce MacGregor, born on May 4, 1979, is a Canadian politician and Member of Parliament (MP) known for his dedicated service to the people. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2015 Canadian federal election, representing the electoral district of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford as a member of the New Democratic Party (NDP).

Before embarking on his political career, MacGregor gained valuable experience working as a constituency assistant to Member of Parliament Jean Crowder. He also held positions as a tree-planting supervisor and a millworker, showcasing his strong work ethic and commitment to serving his community.

Alistair MacGregor was born and raised in Victoria, British Columbia. He spent his formative years in Duncan, where he attended Cowichan Secondary School. While pursuing his education, he worked as a tree planter during summers. In 2003, he graduated from the University of Victoria with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Later, in 2008, he completed his Masters of Arts in professional communication from Royal Roads University, focusing on honing his communication skills.

In 2007, MacGregor relocated to Duncan, where he joined Jean Crowder's team as a constituency assistant. He married during this time and became a proud father of twin girls. When Crowder announced her retirement, MacGregor saw an opportunity to make a difference in his community and entered the NDP nomination race for the newly formed Cowichan—Malahat—Langford riding in preparation for the 2015 federal election. Through a competitive nomination election in January 2015, he emerged as the chosen candidate, triumphing over five other contenders.

During the 2015 federal election, MacGregor faced candidates from other political parties, including the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party. Despite a surge in popularity for the Liberal Party, MacGregor's hard work and strong connection with his constituents allowed him to secure victory in his riding, aligning with the pre-election projections. However, at the national level, his party experienced a loss of seats, resulting in the NDP becoming the third-largest party while the Liberal Party formed a majority government.

Recognized for his dedication and expertise, MacGregor was appointed the NDP's critic for Agriculture and Agri-food on January 31, 2018. He also served as the vice-chair of the parliamentary standing committee on Agriculture and Agri-food, actively working to promote agricultural interests and ensure the well-being of farmers and food producers.

Throughout his tenure in the 42nd Canadian Parliament, MacGregor assumed various responsibilities within the NDP. He was appointed as the party's critic for seniors and the deputy critic for heritage by NDP leader Tom Mulcair. Additionally, he served on the Committee on Justice and Human Rights, playing a crucial role in addressing legal matters and human rights issues. MacGregor established constituency offices in Langford and Duncan, allowing him to better serve his constituents and address their concerns.

MacGregor's dedication to improving the lives of Canadians was reflected in his sponsorship of several private member bills during the 42nd Parliament. Although these bills did not progress beyond the initial stages, they demonstrated his commitment to key issues. Bill 252 aimed to add Shawnigan Lake to the list of navigable waters regulated under the Navigation Protection Act. Bill C-279 sought to limit federal election campaigns to a maximum of 46 days, addressing concerns about lengthy campaigns. Lastly, Bill C-430 aimed to establish an organic farming tax credit, encouraging sustainable agricultural practices.

In the 43rd Canadian Parliament, MacGregor sought re-election in the 2019 general election. Despite the NDP losing seats overall, he successfully secured his riding once again. As the new

 parliamentary session commenced, he assumed the role of NDP critic on agriculture and rural economic development issues, in addition to being the deputy critic for justice and human rights. MacGregor continued his legislative efforts by introducing private member bills, advocating for important causes. For instance, his Bill C-250 sought to prohibit the anchoring of freighter vessels using coastal waters along the Salish Sea to ensure compliance with Transport Canada protocols.

On April 26, 2021, during the 2nd Session of the 43rd Parliament, MacGregor introduced a significant private member bill, Bill C-290. This legislation, known as the Soil Conservation Act, aimed to prioritize soil health and conservation, highlighting his commitment to environmental sustainability.

Alistair Bruce MacGregor remains an esteemed member of the Canadian political landscape, dedicated to serving his constituents and championing important causes within the NDP. His unwavering commitment to his community and his tireless efforts to make a positive impact continue to define his political career.
