Ronald McKinnon MP, a Canadian politician, has dedicated his career to serving the people of Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam in the House of Commons of Canada. Born on August 8, 1951, in Alberta, McKinnon has established himself as a respected and committed representative, having been re-elected in the federal elections of 2015, 2019, and 2021.

In his early life, McKinnon pursued his academic aspirations at the University of Alberta, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree. Additionally, he furthered his education at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, obtaining an honours diploma in Computer Technology. This educational foundation equipped him with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle the challenges of his future endeavors.

Driven by a passion for electoral reform, McKinnon has actively advocated for the adoption of a ranked pairs voting system in Canada. Recognizing the importance of fair and inclusive representation, he has championed this cause throughout his political career.

During the 42nd Canadian Parliament, McKinnon demonstrated his commitment to addressing critical societal issues by introducing Bill C-224, known as the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act, on February 22, 2016. This groundbreaking legislation sought to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to provide immunity for possession of controlled substances when individuals call for emergency medical assistance during drug overdoses. By removing the fear of arrest, McKinnon aimed to ensure that individuals in need would not hesitate to seek vital medical care. The bill received widespread support from all parties and was successfully adopted on May 4, 2017.

Beyond his political pursuits, McKinnon finds fulfillment in his personal life. He is happily married to his wife, Christine, and together they have raised two daughters, Katherine and Sarah. These familial bonds provide him with the support and inspiration to continue his dedicated service to the community.

Ronald McKinnon MP remains a steadfast advocate for his constituents and a respected figure in Canadian politics. His unwavering commitment to electoral reform and his tireless efforts to address critical societal issues underscore his dedication to improving the lives of the people he represents. With each re-election, he reaffirms his promise to serve with integrity and compassion, leaving an indelible mark on the political landscape of Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam.
