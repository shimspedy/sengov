Randall C. Garrison MP, born on August 27, 1951, is a Canadian politician who has dedicated his career to public service and advocacy. He was elected to the House of Commons in the 2011 federal election, representing the electoral district of Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke, as a member of the New Democratic Party. Throughout his tenure, Garrison has been an influential voice for the rights and well-being of diverse communities, particularly focusing on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues as well as national defense.

Before entering politics, Garrison made significant contributions as an educator and researcher. He served as a criminology and political science instructor at Camosun College, where he shared his expertise in criminal justice, political science, and Pacific Rim studies. Additionally, he held positions as a policing researcher in Afghanistan with Amnesty International and contributed to a Christian-Muslim peace-building project in Indonesia under the International Catholic Migration Commission. Garrison's commitment to human rights activism led him to co-coordinate the International Federation for East Timor, acting as a neutral election observer during the East Timorese independence referendum in 1999. In 2010, he served as an international observer with the People's International Observers Mission (PIOM) in the Philippines for their national elections, furthering his dedication to fair and democratic processes.

Born in Nebraska, Garrison relocated to Canada in 1973 and quickly immersed himself in public service. He spent two years working for the government in Yellowknife, recording vital statistics. Subsequently, he moved to British Columbia, where he obtained a master's degree in political science from the University of British Columbia at the age of 26. In Victoria, he worked within the provincial government as a public policy researcher and director. Garrison's involvement in community organizations was notable during this time, as he served on the boards of several non-profit organizations and the Esquimalt Police Board, where he contributed his insights to enhance community safety.

Garrison's initial forays into electoral politics began in the 2004 and 2006 federal elections, as the NDP candidate in the Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca riding. Although he narrowly lost both times to the incumbent MP Keith Martin, these experiences laid the foundation for his future political career. Garrison briefly resided in Vancouver and was nominated as the NDP candidate in the Vancouver Centre riding for the 2008 federal election before withdrawing for personal and professional reasons. Returning to Esquimalt, he was elected to the Esquimalt City Council, where he served a three-year term starting in November 2008.

During his time on the Esquimalt municipal council, Garrison proved himself to be a passionate advocate for his community. He challenged police budget increases and questioned the effectiveness of the Esquimalt-Victoria police force merger, advocating for better use of resources. Garrison actively supported environmental conservation efforts, pushing for greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and championing a permanent ban on coastal drilling and tanker traffic in BC waters. Furthermore, he fought for fair wages and played a role in the adoption of a living wage policy in the municipality.

Returning to federal politics in 2011, Garrison was acclaimed as the NDP candidate in the Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca riding, capitalizing on the retirement of Liberal MP Keith Martin. Garrison's campaign prioritized the development of light rail and universal child care, earning the endorsement of the Conservation Voters of British Columbia. Despite facing a challenging race, he emerged victorious, securing the riding by a narrow margin. Garrison became a member of the official opposition caucus, with the NDP forming the second-largest party in the House of Commons.

Throughout the 41st Parliament, Garrison played a pivotal role in shaping legislative priorities and representing the interests of his constituents. He was appointed to the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security and assumed the role of the NDP critic for LGBT issues. Following the untimely death of NDP leader Jack Layton, Garrison supported Peggy Nash during the subsequent leadership election. When Thomas Mulcair emerged as the new party leader, he entrusted Garrison with the additional role of public safety critic.

Garrison's commitment to advancing LGBT rights manifested in his introduction of legislation to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, aiming to protect gender identity and gender expression from discrimination and hate crimes. He consistently advocated for the rights and well-being of the LGBTQ+ community and participated in remembrance ceremonies for victims of bullying related to sexual orientation. Garrison also held his counterparts accountable, highlighting the importance of genuine understanding and action rather than mere slogans in addressing the challenges faced by marginalized communities.

In addition to his work on LGBT issues, Garrison introduced legislation to return federal oversight to the ecologically and culturally significant Goldstream River through an amendment to the Navigable Waters Protection Act. He also championed the preservation of the endangered Southern resident killer whales, lobbying for the implementation of an action plan by the federal government.

Garrison successfully retained his seat in the 2015 election, representing the newly established electoral district of Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke. Despite the NDP falling to third party status in the 42nd Parliament, Garrison's influence and commitment to his constituents remained strong. He continued to serve as the NDP critic for national defense and LGBT issues, contributing his expertise and perspectives to important policy discussions. Garrison endorsed Jagmeet Singh during the NDP leadership election following Thomas Mulcair's resignation and maintained his critic role when Singh became the party leader.

In December 2015, Garrison reintroduced his private member bill, aiming to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code to protect gender identity and gender expression. While his bill did not progress further, similar provisions were later adopted in Bill C-16, introduced by the Minister of Justice.

Randall C. Garrison MP's dedication to public service, human rights activism, and advocacy for marginalized communities has defined his political career. As an openly gay politician, he has been a steadfast ally and champion for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. Through his legislative initiatives, community engagement, and unwavering commitment to social justice, Garrison has made a lasting impact on Canadian politics and society. He resides in Esquimalt, British Columbia, with his partner, Teddy Pardede.
