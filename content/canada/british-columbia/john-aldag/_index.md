John Aldag is a Canadian Liberal politician known for his representation of the riding of Cloverdale—Langley City in the House of Commons of Canada. Born on April 18, 1963, he embarked on a successful political career that has spanned several elections.

Aldag's early life was rooted in rural Saskatchewan, where he developed a strong work ethic and a passion for public service. After completing his education, he pursued an MBA from Royal Roads University, which equipped him with valuable skills and knowledge for his future endeavors. He then dedicated 32 years of his life to Parks Canada, serving in various locations such as Whitehorse, Lake Louise, Yoho, Waterloo, and Langley. His final role before entering politics was as the administrator of Fort Langley National Historic Site, where he demonstrated his commitment to preserving Canada's cultural heritage.

In December 2013, Aldag took an unpaid leave from Parks Canada to pursue a career in politics. His decision to run for office was fueled by a genuine desire to make a positive impact on his community. His dedication and hard work paid off when he secured victory in the 2015 federal election, earning nearly 46% of the vote. With his election confirmed by Elections Canada on October 26, 2015, he resigned from his position at Parks Canada to fully commit himself to his role as a Member of Parliament.

Aldag's personal life has also been marked by love and family. He is married to Elaine St. John, a doctor, and together they have been blessed with two daughters and one son. At the time of his election, they had already been residents of Langley for a decade, deeply rooted in the community they called home.

As a Member of Parliament, Aldag has been dedicated to serving the interests of his constituents. In the 42nd Canadian Parliament, he was appointed to two influential parliamentary committees: the Environment and Sustainable Development committee and the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying. The latter committee allowed him to consult extensively with his constituents and develop a nuanced understanding of the complex issue of physician-assisted dying. This experience deeply impacted him and inspired him to advocate for families to have open conversations about their wishes in such situations.

In addition to his committee work, Aldag was also named to the House of Commons Special Committee on Electoral Reform. Demonstrating his commitment to diversity and inclusivity, he introduced Private Member's Bill C-374. If adopted, this bill would ensure First Nations, Inuit, and Métis representation on the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada, promoting a more inclusive and accurate portrayal of Canada's rich history.

Aldag's dedication to public service, his commitment to his community, and his genuine desire to make a positive impact have shaped his political career. Through his various roles and initiatives, he has demonstrated his ability to advocate for important causes and represent the interests of his constituents effectively.
