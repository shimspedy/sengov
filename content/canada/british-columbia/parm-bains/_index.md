Parm Bains, known as Paramvir Bains, is a prominent Canadian politician hailing from Victoria, British Columbia. He rose to national prominence after defeating the incumbent Kenny Chiu in the Steveston—Richmond East riding during the 2021 Canadian federal election, representing the Liberal Party of Canada.

Before his political career, Bains made significant contributions to education as an instructor at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. His expertise and dedication in the field helped shape the minds of aspiring students. Prior to his role in academia, Bains served as a media and public relations officer with the provincial government, honing his communication skills and fostering connections within the political sphere.

In 2018, Bains pursued his civic ambitions by running for Richmond City Council in the British Columbia municipal elections. This experience allowed him to engage directly with the local community, understanding their needs and concerns firsthand.

Married and the proud father of two children, Bains finds strength and support in his personal life. These relationships inspire him to work tirelessly for the betterment of his constituents and the Canadian people as a whole.

Despite his successes, Bains has faced controversy surrounding certain events leading up to the 2021 campaign. He attended a rally that garnered significant attention for violating COVID regulations, and tragically, a political organizer was discovered deceased under suspicious circumstances. These incidents raised questions and concerns, shining a spotlight on Bains and his involvement.

Additionally, allegations have surfaced suggesting Bains benefited from misinformation efforts orchestrated by the Chinese government against his conservative opponent, Kenny Chiu. These allegations have sparked ongoing criticism, with Bains facing scrutiny over his alleged close relationship with individuals affiliated with the Chinese government.

In the face of these challenges, Parm Bains remains committed to serving his constituents and contributing positively to Canadian politics. With a background in education, experience in government, and a determination to make a difference, Bains continues to navigate the complexities of public service, striving to uphold the values and aspirations of his constituents and the Liberal Party of Canada.
