Don Davies MP, born on January 16, 1963, is a prominent Canadian federal member of Parliament (MP) representing the New Democratic Party. He has been a steadfast representative for the Vancouver Kingsway riding since his initial election in the 2008 federal election. With his unwavering commitment to public service, Davies has left an indelible mark on Canadian politics.

Davies was born in Edmonton, Alberta and pursued his education at the University of Alberta, earning a Bachelor of Arts in political science and a Bachelor of Laws. After being admitted to the Alberta Bar, he embarked on a career dedicated to public service. Davies commenced his journey as a researcher at the Alberta Legislature, followed by a role as the executive assistant for policy and communications to Ray Martin, the leader of the Official Opposition of Alberta from 1989 to 1991.

In 1991, Davies and his family relocated to Vancouver, where he assumed the position of director of Legal Services for Teamsters Canada (Local 31), a position he held until his election to the House of Commons in 2008. Throughout his tenure, Davies passionately represented workers and the union in arbitration panels and before provincial and federal labor tribunals.

Davies' dedication to improving occupational health and safety and streamlining regulatory systems in the transportation sector led him to serve on numerous public bodies. Additionally, he actively participated in various community organizations, including Tools for Peace, Vancouver Co-op Radio, Lawyers for Social Responsibility, La Quena Cooperative, and the Dickens Community Group. Davies also found time to indulge in his passions outside of politics, such as coaching local hockey and playing the violin.

Residing in the Kensington neighborhood within the Vancouver Kingsway riding, Davies shares his life with his wife, Sheryl Palm, a speech-language pathologist at Vancouver Children's Hospital. Together, they have three children and a granddaughter, forming a loving and supportive family.

Davies made his mark in federal politics with his first election victory in the 2008 federal election. He emerged victorious with 15,933 votes, securing the riding with a comfortable margin over his nearest competitor. The subsequent elections further solidified his position as a respected representative, as he was re-elected in 2011, 2015, and 2019. In the 2019 federal election, Davies obtained 49 percent of the vote, leading his nearest competitor by over 11,000 votes. This remarkable feat not only established him as the longest-serving MP in the history of the Vancouver Kingsway riding but also made him the first MP to win the riding four times.

Throughout his parliamentary career, Davies has held several notable roles and responsibilities. In the 40th Parliament, he served as the NDP critic for Public Safety and National Security, vice-chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, and deputy critic for Western Diversification. Subsequently, in the 41st Parliament, he assumed the positions of Official Opposition critic for Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism, as well as vice-chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism. He then transitioned to the roles of Official Opposition critic for International Trade and deputy critic for Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism. Davies also served as the vice-chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on International Trade.

During the 42nd Parliament, Davies gained recognition for his extensive legislative contributions as a private member. His proposed bills aimed to establish universal pharmacare, a national school nutrition program, and free tuition for students with diverse needs. In the subsequent 43rd Parliament, he was re-appointed to the Health portfolio, demonstrating his dedication to public health matters. Currently, Davies serves on the Standing Committee on Health and was appointed to the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians. Notably, he has taken a firm stance against the extradition of Meng Wanzhou since her arrest in Vancouver in 2018, expressing concerns about potential political interference by former U.S. President Donald Trump.

Don Davies MP's unwavering commitment to public service, coupled with his relentless pursuit of justice and equality, has made him a prominent figure in Canadian politics. Through his tireless efforts, he has proven himself to be a dedicated advocate for the Vancouver Kingsway riding and a passionate voice for the Canadian people.
