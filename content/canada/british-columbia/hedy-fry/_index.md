Hedy Madeleine Fry, PC MP, born on August 6, 1941, is a Trinidadian-Canadian politician and physician renowned for her long and successful career in public service. She holds the distinction of being the longest-serving female Member of Parliament, having won ten consecutive elections in the Vancouver Centre constituency. Notably, in the 1993 election, she achieved a historic victory by defeating incumbent Prime Minister Kim Campbell.

Early Life and Career:
Hedy Madeleine Fry was born in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, and boasts a diverse heritage encompassing Scottish, Spanish, Indian, and Chinese roots. Despite declining an English Literature scholarship to Oxford, she embarked on a remarkable educational journey. Fry completed her equivalent of a BA in Science within a year and pursued medical training at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, Ireland. In 1970, she immigrated to Canada and established a medical practice in Vancouver.

Fry dedicated 23 years of her career to St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver and became involved in various medical organizations. She served as the president of the British Columbia Federation of Medical Women in 1977 and held leadership positions in the Vancouver Medical Association, the BC Medical Association, and the Multiculturalism Committee of the Canadian Medical Association. Additionally, she contributed to her community by volunteering as a Tawny Owl in the Girl Guides of Canada and appeared as a host on the nationally televised CBC show, Doctor Doctor.

Federal Politics:
Fry's foray into federal politics began when she sought and secured the Liberal Party nomination for Vancouver Centre in March 1993. Her victory in the subsequent federal election was a historic milestone, as she unseated Prime Minister Kim Campbell. Fry became the fifth individual and the first to accomplish this feat in their first bid for office. Her electoral success continued, and she has been re-elected in every subsequent election since 1993, cementing her reputation as a formidable and enduring political figure.

During her early years in federal politics, Fry served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Health and Welfare. In 1996, she joined the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and Status of Women. However, she faced controversy when she made remarks in the House of Commons apologizing to the people of Prince George, B.C., for alleged incidents of cross burning. Fry did not retain her ministerial position following a cabinet shuffle in 2002.

When Paul Martin assumed the role of Prime Minister in 2003, Fry was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, focusing on Foreign Credentials. Subsequently, after the 2004 election, she became Parliamentary Secretary to both the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, with a specific focus on the Internationally Trained Workers Initiative.

In Opposition:
Fry's electoral triumphs extended to the opposition years as well. In 2006, she defeated prominent NDP activist and former MP Svend Robinson, followed by a victory over high-profile Conservative candidate Lorne Mayencourt in 2008. Notably, Fry entered the Liberal party leadership race in 2006, becoming the 11th individual, third woman, and sole Westerner to officially join the race. Emphasizing Canada's diversity as its greatest competitive advantage, she advocated for a non-ideological approach to problem-solving. Ultimately, Fry withdrew from the contest and threw her support behind Bob Rae.

Continuing her political journey, Fry won re-election for a sixth term in 2008 and was appointed Official Opposition Critic for Canadian Heritage. Additionally, Liberal leadership candidate Bob Rae selected Fry as his Campaign Co-Chair in British Columbia. In 2011, despite the Liberal Party losing its status as the Official Opposition, Fry remained active in parliamentary affairs and assumed the role of Liberal Critic for Health.

Trudeau Government:
The 2015 election marked yet another victory for Fry in her constituency, solidifying her status as the oldest Canadian MP and the longest-serving female MP. During the 42nd Parliament, she earned a position on the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, which provides oversight to Canada's security services and mandates Top Secret security clearance.

In the 2019 election, Fry secured her ninth consecutive term in Vancouver Centre. She presently serves as the Special Representative for Gender Issues at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, a role she has fulfilled since 2010. Additionally, Fry is an esteemed member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, as well as the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Family:
Beyond her illustrious career, Hedy Madeleine Fry finds joy in her personal life. She is the proud mother of three adult sons and dotes on her four beloved grandchildren. Notably, her eldest son, Pete Fry, followed in his mother's footsteps and was elected to Vancouver City Council in the 2018 municipal election, further contributing to the family's commitment to public service.
