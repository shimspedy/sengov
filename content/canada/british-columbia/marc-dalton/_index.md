Marc Dalton is a Canadian politician known for his dedication to public service and his involvement in federal and provincial politics. He currently serves as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge, a position he attained after the 2019 Canadian federal election.

Before his successful run as a Member of Parliament, Marc Dalton made significant contributions as a BC Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. He was elected following the 2009 and 2013 provincial elections, representing the riding of Maple Ridge-Mission.

Marc Dalton's political career began when he ran as a Conservative candidate in the 2006 federal election in the Burnaby—New Westminster riding. Although he lost to the incumbent MP Peter Julian, Dalton's determination remained unwavering. However, his nomination for the 2008 federal election in the same riding was declined by the Conservative Party of Canada.

Prior to his entry into elected office, Dalton worked as a dedicated teacher in the Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows School District 42, educating students at both the elementary and high school levels. During the BC teachers' strike in 2005, Dalton sparked controversy among fellow staff members when he crossed union picket lines. His decision was based on his belief in the rule of law, stating that it was essential to adhere to legal mandates despite personal opinions or disagreements.

In his first term as an MLA, Marc Dalton served as the parliamentary secretary for independent schools, a role established by former British Columbia Premier Christy Clark in 2012. Drawing from his experience as a retired public school teacher, Dalton emphasized the importance of family choice in education and highlighted the cost-saving benefits for the education ministry resulting from tuition fees paid by parents in independent schools.

Throughout his career, Dalton actively participated in various initiatives and committees. He served on the Experience the Fraser steering committee, which focused on developing trails and promoting tourism in the region. In 2012, he advocated for a name change for the BC Liberals, expressing concerns about voter confusion between the provincial and federal conservative parties.

Dalton's political journey also faced challenges and controversies. During the 2009 British Columbia general election, an email written by Dalton in 1996 resurfaced, containing remarks deemed homophobic. Dalton issued an apology, clarifying that his intention was not to offend or hurt anyone.

In 2014, Dalton faced criticism for his comments on child poverty, leading to debates in the B.C. Legislature. While discussing the issue, Dalton questioned the existence of children experiencing hunger and homelessness in British Columbia. His remarks were met with strong opposition from his colleagues and advocacy groups.

Dalton's stance on certain issues, such as transgender rights and conversion therapy, also drew scrutiny. He voted against legislation that aimed to protect LGBTQ2+ individuals from conversion therapy and opposed bills related to transparency and accountability in environmental efforts and the rights of Indigenous peoples.

Outside of politics, Dalton served in the Canadian Armed Forces Reserves and is a member of the Royal Canadian Legion. He has been actively involved in the Maple Ridge Community Church as an elder. Dalton takes pride in his Cree-Métis Indigenous heritage and has embraced his lineage throughout his career.

With a strong commitment to public service and a determined spirit, Marc Dalton continues to serve his constituents and advocate for his beliefs in the political arena.
