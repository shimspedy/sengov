Todd Doherty MP, born in 1968, is a prominent Canadian politician known for his dedicated service as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada. He represents the federal electoral district Cariboo—Prince George, having been elected during the 2015 Canadian federal election.

Beyond his political career, Todd Doherty is a devoted family man. He is married to Kelly, and together they cherish their four children, fostering a loving and supportive home environment.

For over two decades, Todd and Kelly have been successful small business owners. Prior to his political endeavors, Todd held a prominent role as an aviation executive, collaborating with various industry stakeholders and governmental bodies at the provincial and federal levels. He played a pivotal role in promoting international trade, tourism, and aviation opportunities, working tirelessly to enhance Canada's standing on the global stage.

During the initial sitting of the 42nd Parliament, Todd Doherty demonstrated his commitment to key societal issues by tabling four private members bills. One of his notable achievements is Bill C-211, the landmark legislation known as the "Act to Establish a National Framework on PTSD and Mental Health Challenges with First Responders, Veterans, and Military." This bill garnered unanimous support and was passed on June 16, 2017, paving the way for Senate review.

Another noteworthy contribution from Todd Doherty is Bill C-209, which sought to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. This bill aimed to ensure that the Correctional Service of Canada discloses relevant details of the statutory release of high-profile offenders, enabling public disclosure and informing victims of such releases.

Recognizing the invaluable contributions made by members of the Canadian Forces and emergency response professionals, including police officers, firefighters, and paramedics, Todd championed Bill C-207. This legislation designated the third day of March each year as a day for all Canadians to express their heartfelt appreciation for the heroic work undertaken by these brave individuals.

Additionally, Todd Doherty spearheaded Bill C-208, which focused on amending the Canada Evidence Act to provide clear directives to courts regarding the interpretation of disputed written all-numeric dates in Canada.

In his commitment to acknowledging the remarkable service of Search & Rescue volunteers, Todd authored Bill C-347, which called upon the Federal Government to establish a national service medal for these selfless individuals. Although he authored the bill, he graciously permitted MP Mel Arnold to table C-347, as Bill C-211 had made significant progress through Parliament.

In a significant achievement, the Government of Canada announced the creation of a national service medal for Search & Rescue volunteers in October 2017, a testament to Todd's tireless advocacy.

Demonstrating his unwavering dedication to mental health and suicide prevention, Todd Doherty tabled a motion in November 2020 to establish a single national three-digit telephone number, 988, specifically for suicide hotlines. He argued that the existing ten-digit numbers posed a barrier to access, emphasizing the need for a simpler, more intuitive system. In December, the House of Commons unanimously voted in favor of his proposal, highlighting the widespread recognition and support for this critical initiative.

Todd Doherty MP continues to be a forceful advocate for his constituents, working diligently to address societal challenges, champion mental health initiatives, and support the dedicated individuals who serve and protect Canada.
