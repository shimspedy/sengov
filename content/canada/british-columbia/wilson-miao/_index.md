Wilson Miao MP is a Canadian politician currently serving as the member of parliament for Richmond Centre. Born on April 12, 1987, he entered the political arena as a representative of the Liberal Party after winning the seat in the 2021 federal election.

Early Life and Education
Wilson Miao immigrated to Canada from Hong Kong in 1996, settling in Richmond, British Columbia. He pursued his education at Simon Fraser University, focusing on business administration. Although he attended Simon Fraser University, records indicate that he did not graduate with a degree in business administration.

Before his political career, Miao gained professional experience in corporate marketing and worked as a real estate agent in the Lower Mainland. With fluency in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English, he possesses multilingual skills that contribute to his ability to connect with diverse communities.

Political Career
As the acclaimed Liberal candidate for Richmond Centre, Miao voiced his dedication to advocating for seniors, newcomers, and youth. He identified affordable and comfortable retirement for seniors as a critical issue for Canadians and expressed his desire to listen to the concerns of his constituents and bring their voices to Ottawa.

In a closely contested election, Miao secured victory over the Conservative incumbent Alice Wong by a margin of fewer than 700 votes. This achievement propelled him into the House of Commons as the representative for Richmond Centre.

During his maiden speech in the House of Commons, Miao stressed the importance of unity in effecting genuine change and fostering meaningful progress. Currently, he holds positions on two parliamentary standing committees, namely Veteran Affairs and International Trade.

In January 2023, Miao established his constituency office in Richmond Centre after a prolonged period of 16 months without one]. However, this delay resulted in significant criticism regarding his accessibility to constituents during that time. Additionally, his office incurred the highest renovation expenses among all Members of Parliament.
