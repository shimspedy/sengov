Harjit Singh Sajjan PC OMM MSM CD MP (pronounced HAR-jeet SING SAJ-ən; born September 6, 1970) is a Canadian politician and public servant who has made significant contributions to both the military and political spheres in Canada. He currently serves as the Minister of International Development, a position he has held since October 26, 2021. Sajjan is a member of the Liberal Party and represents the Vancouver South riding in British Columbia (BC) in the House of Commons.

Sajjan's journey began in the village of Bombeli, located in the Hoshiarpur district of Punjab, India, where he was born on September 6, 1970. His father, Kundan Sajjan, served as a head constable in the Punjab Police and later became a member of the World Sikh Organization (WSO), a Sikh advocacy group. In 1976, at the age of five, Sajjan, along with his mother and older sister, immigrated to Canada to join his father, who had already moved to BC to work at a sawmill. The family settled in South Vancouver, where Sajjan spent his formative years.

After completing his education, Sajjan embarked on a remarkable military career. He joined The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own) in 1989 as a trooper and quickly rose through the ranks. In 1991, he was commissioned as an officer and eventually achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Sajjan deployed overseas four times, serving in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Afghanistan on three separate occasions. His contributions to counterinsurgency efforts and intelligence gathering during his deployments were highly regarded by his superiors.

Following his military service, Sajjan transitioned to the Vancouver Police Department in 2000, where he spent 11 years as a police officer. He specialized in investigating gang crimes and drug trafficking, earning a reputation for his expertise in organized crime investigations. Sajjan's experience in law enforcement, combined with his military background, uniquely positioned him to contribute to both sectors.

Sajjan's dedication and leadership were recognized during his deployments to Afghanistan. His exceptional work as a liaison officer with the Afghan police, coupled with his tactical counterinsurgency knowledge, played a pivotal role in the planning and execution of Operation Medusa in 2006. His efforts earned him praise from Brigadier General David Fraser, who lauded Sajjan as a valuable asset and commended his contributions to coalition efforts. Sajjan's expertise in intelligence gathering led him to establish his own consulting business, where he shared his knowledge with Canadian and American military personnel.

In 2011, Sajjan achieved another milestone by becoming the first Sikh to command a Canadian Army reserve regiment, commanding The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own). Throughout his military career, he received numerous accolades for his service, including the Meritorious Service Medal, the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal, and the Order of Military Merit. Sajjan also served as an Aide-de-Camp to the lieutenant governor of British Columbia.

Sajjan's commitment to his Sikh faith is an integral part of his identity. He was baptized as a Sikh during his teenage years as a means to distance himself from negative influences in his community. His adherence to his faith, including the requirement to maintain his facial hair, inspired him to invent a gas mask compatible with beards, which he patented in 1996.

In addition to his military achievements, Sajjan ventured into politics and successfully ran for the Vancouver South riding during the 2015 federal election, unseating the Conservative incumbent. Shortly after his election, he was appointed as the Minister of National Defence in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Cabinet on November 4, 2015. Sajjan served in this role until 2021, making history as Canada's first Sikh Minister of National Defence. He briefly assumed the responsibilities of Minister of Veterans Affairs in 2019 before transitioning to his current position as Minister of International Development.

Sajjan's political career has not been without controversy. He has faced allegations of connections with the Khalistan movement, a Sikh separatist movement, which strained diplomatic relations with Punjab's former chief minister. Additionally, he came under scrutiny for his portrayal of his role in Operation Medusa, where he described himself as "the architect" of the offensive. While his claims were met with criticism, including from military personnel, Sajjan apologized for the mischaracterization and acknowledged the collaborative efforts involved in planning the operation.

Throughout his life, Harjit Singh Sajjan has been driven by a deep sense of duty, integrity, and service. His accomplishments as a military officer, police detective, and politician exemplify his dedication to making a positive impact in Canada and beyond. With his continued involvement in public service, Sajjan remains committed to the betterment of his country and the well-being of its citizens.
