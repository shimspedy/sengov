Kerry-Lynne Donna Findlay PC KC MP, born on January 12, 1955, is a Canadian politician and member of Parliament for South Surrey—White Rock since 2019. She previously represented the electoral district of Delta—Richmond East in the House of Commons of Canada from 2011 to 2015. Findlay is a member of the Conservative Party and has held various important positions within the party during her career.

Findlay was born in Ladysmith, British Columbia, and grew up in Nanaimo and Victoria. Her brother, Greg Findlay, was a linebacker for the BC Lions Canadian football team. After completing her education at Crofton House School in Vancouver, she attended the University of British Columbia. In 1975, she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and political science, followed by a law degree in 1978.

Starting her legal career, Findlay articled at Kowarsky and Company in Vancouver and worked there as an associate for two years. She later served as in-house counsel for the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia. In 1981, she established her own practice and then joined Connell Lightbody in 1987. In 1996, she moved to Watson Goepel Maledy, where she continued her legal work. Throughout her legal career, Findlay actively participated in both the national and B.C. provincial branch of the Canadian Bar Association. She held several positions within the organization, including the national and provincial chair of the Constitutional Law Section and member of the National Task Force on Canadian Court Reform. In 1997–1998, she served as the president of the B.C. Branch. Her accomplishments led to her appointment as a Queen's Counsel in March 1999 by the Attorney General of British Columbia. Additionally, from 2006 to 2011, she served a five-year term as a Member of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, appointed by the Federal Minister of Justice.

Findlay has been recognized for her contributions beyond her legal career. She received the Vancouver YWCA Woman of Distinction Award in the category of Management, Professions, and Trades in May 2001. In 2011, she was honored with the national Cecilia I. Johnstone Award, which acknowledges women who have achieved professional excellence and have influenced other women to pursue legal careers.

Findlay's political journey began with her previous support for the federal Liberal Party. However, she later became a member of the Canadian Alliance and ran as a candidate in the 2000 federal election in the riding of Vancouver Quadra, but was unsuccessful. In March 2011, she was selected as the Conservative Party's candidate for Delta—Richmond East and won the seat in the subsequent federal election. During her time in the 41st Parliament, she served as a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. She was also involved in the selection process for a Supreme Court justice replacement. Findlay held various roles within the Conservative Party, including Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice in May 2011, Associate Minister of National Defence from February 2013, and Minister of National Revenue from July 2013 until November 2015.

In the 2015 election, Findlay ran for the Conservatives in the reconstituted riding of Delta but was defeated by Liberal candidate Carla Qualtrough. She later contested the South Surrey—White Rock by-election in 2017 but was again unsuccessful. However, in the 2019 election, Findlay defeated her Liberal opponent Gordie Hogg and became the member of Parliament for South Surrey—White Rock. She served as the shadow minister for Environment and Climate Change from November 2019 to September 2020. Notably, she faced criticism in August 2020 for retweeting a post connecting Chrystia Freeland with George Soros. Findlay apologized and removed the tweet shortly after. She also voted in support of Bill C-233, which aimed to amend the Criminal Code regarding sex-selective abortion.

Findlay was re-elected in 2021, defeating Gordie Hogg once again. She served as the shadow minister for National Defence from November 2021 to October 2022. Following the ouster of Erin O'Toole as Conservative leader in February 2022, Findlay announced her intention to run for interim party leader, although Candice Bergen was ultimately chosen for the role. On September 13, 2022, Findlay was named Chief Opposition Whip by Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, becoming the first woman to serve in this role for the Conservatives.

In addition to her political career, Findlay has actively participated in her community. She has held volunteer positions such as chair of the Vancouver City Planning Commission, board member of Science World, executive member of the Junior Leagues of Canada, president of the Delta Zeta chapter of Alpha Gamma Delta International Fraternity, and honorary counsel for the Chinese Benevolent Association of Canada. In 2016, she received the Distinguished Citizen award from Alpha Gamma Delta.

Findlay's personal life includes her marriage to lawyer A. Boyd Ferris, with whom she had two children. After Ferris passed away from a heart attack in 1989, she married actor Brent Chapman in 1993. They have two daughters together and are proud grandparents to five grandchildren.
