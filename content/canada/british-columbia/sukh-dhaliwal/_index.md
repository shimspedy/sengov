Sukhminder "Sukh" Singh Dhaliwal MP, born on October 1, 1960, is a Canadian businessman and politician who has made significant contributions to his community. Currently serving as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Surrey—Newton since 2015, Dhaliwal has had a dynamic political career. From 2006 to 2011, he represented the Newton—North Delta riding as a Member of Parliament.

Born in Sujapur, Punjab, India, Dhaliwal immigrated to Canada in 1999 and became a Canadian citizen three years later. As a successful businessman, he co-founded a prominent land surveying company and played an active role in the municipal politics of Surrey. Dhaliwal's influence was evident when he secured over 2,600 new party members, constituting more than half of the total membership of the Surrey Electors Team. Despite his efforts, Dhaliwal faced defeat in his own bid for a seat on the city council during the November 1999 municipal elections.

Dhaliwal's foray into federal politics began as the federal Liberal candidate for the Newton-North Delta riding in 2004. Although he lost to Conservative Gurmant Grewal by a slim margin of over 500 votes, Dhaliwal remained undeterred. In 2006, he confronted Conservative newcomer Phil Eidsvik and the strong presence of the New Democratic Party in the riding, with Nancy Clegg running as their candidate. Dhaliwal's determination paid off as he emerged victorious, securing the seat with a margin of precisely 1,000 votes.

During the 2006 Liberal leadership campaign, Dhaliwal initially expressed support for Joe Volpe but eventually shifted his allegiance to Michael Ignatieff. His influence within the Sikh community proved crucial in garnering support for Ignatieff's campaign. Dhaliwal played an instrumental role in Ignatieff's successful second leadership campaign in 2008, which, unfortunately, was short-lived.

In 2008, Dhaliwal found himself embroiled in controversy when he wrote a letter on official House of Commons stationery to a U.S. District Court judge in support of convicted international drug trafficker Ranjit Singh Cheema. However, despite this setback, Dhaliwal was re-elected to Parliament on October 14, 2008, with a significant margin of nearly 2,500 votes. Following his re-election, he assumed the role of Chair of the Northern and Western Caucus of the Liberal Party. Additionally, Dhaliwal served as the critic for the Asia Pacific Gateway and Western Economic Diversification Canada.

Dhaliwal's dedication to public service extended to his participation in several House of Commons Committees, including International Trade, Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities, and Access to Information, Privacy, and Ethics. Notably, the Ethics Committee garnered substantial attention when it investigated allegations surrounding Karlheinz Schreiber's interactions with former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.

Unfortunately, Dhaliwal experienced a defeat in the 2011 federal election, losing his seat to Jinny Sims of the New Democratic Party. After a review of his candidacy by the BC Liberal Party, he decided to withdraw from running in the provincial election due to his involvement in a tax evasion case. Dhaliwal, along with his wife Balwinder Kaur Dhaliwal (also known as "Roni"), who worked as a Surrey bylaw officer, faced charges of tax evasion. Ultimately, he was convicted of three counts while his wife was convicted of six counts under the Criminal Code of Canada.

However, in December 2014, Dhaliwal made a triumphant return to the political arena by winning the Liberal nomination in the newly-formed riding of Surrey—Newton ahead of the 2015 election. He went on to defeat the NDP incumbent Jinny Sims, securing the seat with an impressive 56 percent of the vote.

In 2021, Dhaliwal expressed his concern and condemned the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre in India, which claimed the lives of eight people in a vehicle-ramming attack. Troubled by the disturbing video footage of the incident, Dhaliwal likened it to a terror attack, drawing parallels to the tragic truck attack in London, Ontario.

Sukhminder "Sukh" Singh Dhaliwal MP has left an indelible mark in Canadian politics through his contributions as a businessman and a dedicated member of Parliament. His resilience, community involvement, and commitment to justice have defined his remarkable career.
