Jonathan Wilkinson PC MP, born on June 11, 1965, is a Canadian politician currently serving as the Minister of Natural Resources since 2021. As a member of the Liberal Party, Wilkinson has made significant contributions to Canadian politics. He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for North Vancouver in 2015, marking the beginning of his political career.

Before entering politics, Wilkinson had a diverse background. Born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, he spent his formative years in Saskatoon. Notably, he served as the leader of the New Democratic Party's youth wing in Saskatchewan, demonstrating his early engagement and interest in political activism.

Wilkinson pursued higher education, earning a bachelor's degree from the University of Saskatchewan. In 1988, he was honored as the Prairies Rhodes Scholar and went on to study Politics, Philosophy, and Economics at Exeter College, Oxford. During his time at Oxford and McGill, Wilkinson obtained master's degrees in international relations, politics, and economics.

His professional career began with his role as an advisor to Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow, followed by a tenure in the provincial civil service from 1991 to 1995. Subsequently, Wilkinson joined Bain & Company's Toronto branch in 1995. In 1999, he relocated to Vancouver to work for QuestAir Technologies, where he ultimately became the CEO in 2002. Demonstrating his commitment to green technology, Wilkinson served as the senior vice-president for business development in Nexterra Systems, a biomass company, in 2009. In 2011, he assumed the position of CEO at BioteQ Environmental Technologies, a water treatment company based in Vancouver.

Wilkinson's political aspirations came to fruition in 2015 when he ran for MP of North Vancouver. He secured a significant victory, defeating Conservative parliamentary secretary Andrew Saxton by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. This election marked a turning point as North Vancouver had been predominantly governed by a center-right party since 1979. In 2019, Wilkinson successfully defended his seat, albeit with a reduced margin, defeating Saxton once again by a comfortable 16 percentage points.

Recognizing his capabilities and dedication, on November 20, 2019, Wilkinson was appointed as the Minister of Environment and Climate Change in the 29th Canadian Ministry. He played a pivotal role in shaping environmental policies and tackling climate change. In 2018, he also served as the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coast Guard, showcasing his versatility and commitment to public service.

Continuing his commitment to public service, Wilkinson assumed the position of Minister of Natural Resources in 2021. In this capacity, he has been responsible for managing Canada's vast natural resources and ensuring their sustainable development.

Jonathan Wilkinson's journey from his early involvement in political activism to his successful career in both the private sector and Canadian politics exemplifies his dedication to making a positive impact on his country. His contributions to environmental issues and sustainable development have solidified his reputation as a respected politician and advocate for a greener future.
