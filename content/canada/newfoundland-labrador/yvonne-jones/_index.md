Yvonne Jean Jones MP, born on March 15, 1968, is a Canadian politician hailing from Newfoundland and Labrador. She made her mark in the political arena by being elected to the House of Commons of Canada through a by-election held on May 13, 2013. As a member of the Liberal Party caucus, she represents the district of Labrador, effectively voicing the concerns and interests of her constituents.

Before venturing into federal politics, Yvonne Jean Jones had a notable career in provincial politics. From 1996 to 2013, she served as the representative for the Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair district in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. During her tenure, she held various significant positions, including Minister of Fisheries in Premier Roger Grimes' government. Additionally, she rose to prominence within the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador, eventually becoming the party's leader and Leader of the Official Opposition.

Yvonne Jean Jones' involvement in public service can be traced back to her earlier professional experiences. Armed with a background in journalism, she worked for several community newspapers across the province. She also served as an employment counselor and field worker for the Battle Harbour Development Association in collaboration with Human Resources Development Canada.

Furthermore, Yvonne Jean Jones contributed to her local community as the mayor of Mary's Harbour, Labrador from 1991 to 1996. Her commitment to public service led her to seek the Liberal Party nomination for the provincial electoral district of Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair in 1996. Although she initially lost the nomination to the incumbent Danny Dumaresque, she persevered as an Independent candidate and emerged victorious in the general election, defeating Dumaresque himself. Her electoral success continued, as she was re-elected in subsequent elections held in 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2011.

During her provincial political career, Yvonne Jean Jones demonstrated her dedication to important causes. She served as the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture and the Minister Responsible for the Status of Women after being appointed by Premier Roger Grimes in February 2003. However, her ministerial responsibilities were cut short when the Liberal government was defeated in the provincial election later that year.

Notably, Yvonne Jean Jones took a principled stance on the Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement (Bill 44) in 2004, becoming the sole member of the House of Assembly to vote against it. She expressed concern over the agreement's potential impact on the recognition and acceptance of claims by the Labrador Metis Nation. Jones, who proudly identified as Metis, emphasized the need for inclusive settlements that acknowledged the history and heritage of all communities.

Throughout her political career, Yvonne Jean Jones emerged as a vocal critic of the Muskrat Falls hydro development project, advocating for responsible and sustainable approaches to resource management and environmental protection.

In 2007, Yvonne Jean Jones' leadership skills were recognized when she was appointed as the interim leader of the Liberal Party and subsequently became the Official Opposition Leader. This appointment made her the first woman to lead the Liberal Party in Newfoundland and Labrador. Although the party initially planned to hold a leadership convention in 2008, the vote was postponed multiple times. Yvonne Jean Jones continued to serve as the interim leader, and in December 2009, she announced her intention to run for the permanent leadership once the convention was rescheduled. Her commitment to the party and its ideals was evident when she was acclaimed as the Liberal leader on July 30, 2010, as the sole candidate who filed nomination papers for the position.

However, Yvonne Jean Jones faced personal challenges during her leadership tenure. In August 2010, she announced that she would be taking a leave of absence from her position to undergo treatment for breast cancer, which resulted in the delay of her formal swearing-in as leader. After successfully battling the illness, she returned to work in early 2011 and was officially sworn in as the Liberal leader at the party's Spring leadership convention.

Despite her resilience and commitment, Yvonne Jean Jones faced fluctuating support in public opinion polls during her leadership. While the Liberal Party's support remained in the mid-teens, Jones' personal popularity was lower. Nevertheless, there were moments when her popularity experienced an upswing, reaching its peak at 18% in a poll conducted in March 2011. Ultimately, her leadership concluded on August 9, 2011, two months before the provincial election, as she cited a slower recovery from breast cancer as the reason for her resignation. Despite stepping down as leader, she sought re-election in her district and emerged victorious with an overwhelming 71% of the popular vote.

Transitioning to federal politics, Yvonne Jean Jones resigned her seat in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly in April 2013 to contest the federal by-election in Labrador, which arose from the resignation of Peter Penashue. Her campaign proved successful, as she triumphed over Penashue and secured the seat on May 13, 2013. She was officially sworn in as a Member of Parliament on June 4, 2013.

Within the federal realm, Yvonne Jean Jones took on various roles and responsibilities, reflecting her dedication to the welfare of her constituents and the nation. She was appointed as the Liberal critic for Northern Development, the Northern Economic Development Agency, the Arctic Council, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, and Search and Rescue. Her commitment to the Liberal Party's cause was further evident when she was elected as the Chair of the Liberal Party of Canada Newfoundland and Labrador caucus in August 2013. Additionally, she assumed the position of Vice-Chair of the Public Accounts committee in February 2014.

Over the years, Yvonne Jean Jones continued to be re-elected in federal elections, securing her mandate and further solidifying her position as a representative of the people. Notably, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs on December 2, 2015, showcasing her dedication to addressing the unique needs and concerns of Indigenous and Northern communities.

In late August 2018, Yvonne Jean Jones expanded her parliamentary responsibilities when she was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Intergovernmental and Northern Affairs and Internal Trade.

Despite her political career being marked by achievements and contributions, Yvonne Jean Jones faced controversy in April 2021 when she was involved in a dispute with Nunavut NDP MP Mumilaaq Qaqqaq. The disagreement centered around issues of identity and regional representation, with Qaqqaq asserting that Jones was not an Inuk and that southern Labrador was not an Inuit region. Jones dismissed Qaqqaq's comments as "immature and na√Øve," and Qaqqaq later issued an email statement apologizing for her handling of the situation.

Undeterred by the challenges that come with political life, Yvonne Jean Jones continued to serve as a Member of Parliament, reaffirming her commitment to her constituents and the broader Canadian population. In the 2019 federal election, she was successfully re-elected, securing her mandate once again. Moreover, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Northern Affairs on December 12, 2019, further amplifying her influence and capacity to effect change.

Yvonne Jean Jones' political journey continued with her re-election in the 2021 federal election, underscoring the trust and support she has garnered from the electorate. Throughout her career, she has demonstrated resilience, dedication, and a strong sense of advocacy, making significant contributions to both provincial and federal politics.
