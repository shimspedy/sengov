Gudrid Ida "Gudie" Hutchings, born on September 1, 1959, in Corner Brook, is a Canadian politician and member of the Liberal Party. Since October 26, 2021, she has held the position of Minister of Rural Economic Development. Hutchings has been representing the Long Range Mountains constituency in the House of Commons since the 2015 election.

Growing up in the Humber Valley, Hutchings was born to Arthur Lundrigan and Ida Lundrigan (n√©e Johnson). She pursued her education at Acadia University before embarking on a successful career in business. With a career spanning nearly three decades, she primarily worked in the tourism and outfitting industries.

Before entering politics, Hutchings established herself as a prominent figure in her local community. She owned fly fishing lodges in Labrador and dedicated over ten years to the Newfoundland and Labrador Outfitters Association, eventually becoming its president. Additionally, Hutchings served on the inaugural national board of the Canadian Federation of Outfitting Associations. Her contributions extended to the Corner Brook Chamber of Commerce, where she held the position of president. She also chaired the Battle Harbour Historic Trust at the time of her election. Hutchings's commitment to community involvement was evident in her more than 15 years of volunteer work with Girl Guides of Canada, where she served as a leader and had been a member during her own childhood.

Hutchings embarked on her political career in November 2014 when she sought the Liberal Party nomination for the riding of Long Range Mountains, following the decision of Gerry Byrne not to run in the 2015 federal election. Supported by Byrne, Hutchings secured the nomination in March 2015 and went on to win the election. On December 2, 2015, she was appointed parliamentary secretary to the minister of small business and tourism. Her dedication and competence led to her appointment to the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians on November 6, 2017.

Re-elected in the 2019 federal election, Hutchings continued to make significant contributions. On December 12, 2019, she assumed the role of parliamentary secretary to the minister for women and gender equality and rural economic development, Maryam Monsef. After the 2021 federal election, where Hutchings was re-elected, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau entrusted her with the Rural Economic Development portfolio, recognizing her capabilities and commitment to fostering economic growth in rural communities.
