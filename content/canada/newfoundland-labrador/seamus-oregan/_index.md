Over the years, he has made significant contributions to the Canadian government, earning him a position in the Cabinet in 2017.

O'Regan's career in politics has been marked by his commitment to various ministerial roles. From 2017 to 2019, he served as the Minister of Veterans Affairs and the Associate Minister of National Defence, focusing on supporting and advocating for the welfare of veterans. In 2019, he assumed the responsibilities of the Minister of Indigenous Services, working towards improving the lives of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Subsequently, O'Regan took on the crucial role of Minister of Natural Resources, demonstrating his dedication to environmental stewardship and sustainable development from 2019 to 2021.

Before embarking on his political career, O'Regan had a successful stint in the media industry. He served as a correspondent for CTV National News and co-hosted Canada AM alongside Beverly Thomson from 2003 to 2011. Throughout his time in journalism, O'Regan displayed his journalistic prowess and ability to engage viewers with his insightful reporting and analysis. Additionally, he worked on independent television productions and served as a media innovator in residence at Ryerson University. O'Regan's expertise and experiences in the media industry have undoubtedly shaped his approach to public service and communication.

Born in St. John's, Newfoundland, O'Regan spent a significant portion of his upbringing in Goose Bay, where he attended Goose High School. He comes from a background of Irish heritage and is the son of Seamus O'Regan, a respected judge of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. Even from a young age, O'Regan exhibited a passion for storytelling and community engagement. At the age of 10, he became a regional correspondent for CBC Radio's Anybody Home?, showcasing his early aptitude for sharing compelling stories.

O'Regan pursued his academic aspirations by studying politics at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia and at University College Dublin in Ireland. Additionally, he honed his skills in marketing strategies at INSEAD, an esteemed international business school near Paris, France. His pursuit of knowledge led him to the University of Cambridge, where he obtained a Masters of Philosophy in Politics, studying at Darwin College in Cambridge, England.

Throughout his career, O'Regan has demonstrated his commitment to public service and making a positive impact on society.

Beyond his political and professional endeavors, O'Regan is devoted to various causes and organizations.

In his personal life, O'Regan has been in a long-term relationship with his partner, Steve Doussis, whom he married on July 9, 2010, in Newfoundland. However, O'Regan has faced personal challenges as well. In January 2016, he openly addressed his struggle with alcoholism and sought treatment through a rehabilitation program. Additionally, he faced health concerns, including hospitalization in Ottawa for a major gastrointestinal obstruction in November 2017.

Tragedy struck O'Regan's life in November 2020 with the passing of his father, Seamus Bernard O'Regan. Following this event, Natural Resources Canada announcements began referring to him as Seamus O'Regan Jr., adding the suffix "Jr." to his name.
