Salma Zahid MP is a renowned Canadian politician known for her dedication to public service and her tireless efforts in representing the people of Scarborough Centre. She was elected as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada during the 2015 Canadian federal election, succeeding the Conservative Roxanne James. Her remarkable journey in politics and her commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of her constituents have made her a respected figure in Canadian politics.

Born in Coventry, Zahid's early life experiences shaped her passion for community engagement and public service. She holds a master's degree in educational management and administration from the University of London's Institute of Education, as well as an MBA from Quaid e Azam University in Pakistan. Zahid's diverse educational background equipped her with the necessary knowledge and skills to make a meaningful impact in her chosen career path.

Zahid is proud of her Pakistani Canadian heritage and has been a resident of Scarborough since 2000. As a mother of two, she understands the importance of building a prosperous and inclusive society for future generations. Zahid's unwavering dedication to her community and her outstanding contributions have earned her recognition, including the prestigious Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.

Before entering politics, Zahid worked as a community organizer and held various positions within the Government of Ontario. Her experience in grassroots organizing and her deep understanding of public administration laid a solid foundation for her political career. With a firm belief in the power of collective action, Zahid embarked on a journey to serve her community in a larger capacity.

In the 2015 Canadian federal election, Zahid emerged victorious, earning the trust and support of the people of Scarborough Centre. She became a Member of Parliament, representing the constituency with passion and dedication. During her time in the 42nd Parliament, Zahid served as the Vice-Chair for the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, where she effectively advocated for the rights and interests of racialized women.

In February 2018, Zahid faced a personal health challenge when she was diagnosed with Stage 4 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Despite the difficulties, Zahid approached her battle with resilience and courage. Her medical leave became a source of controversy when the Scarborough Centre Conservative Party of Canada Riding Association Vice President used it to sell memberships through robocalls. Nevertheless, Zahid persevered, undergoing chemotherapy treatments and finding solace in her Islamic faith. As a testament to her strength and determination, Zahid became the first Member of Parliament to wear a hijab in the House of Commons in May 2018, receiving both admiration and criticism. She responded to the negative reactions by emphasizing the personal nature of her decision and the importance of religious freedom.

Following her successful recovery and completion of six rounds of chemotherapy, Zahid triumphantly returned to her role as a Member of Parliament, cancer-free and more motivated than ever to serve her constituents. Her unwavering resilience and dedication to public service inspired many across the nation.

In the 2019 Canadian federal election, Zahid was re-nominated by the Liberal Party to represent Scarborough Centre. Her commitment to fighting for social justice, advocating for marginalized communities, and advancing women's rights resonated with the electorate, further cementing her position as a respected political figure.

Her dedication to representing Scarborough Centre and her unwavering advocacy for inclusivity and equality have earned her the admiration and support of many.
