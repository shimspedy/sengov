Ryan Williams, a Canadian politician, was born on January 23, 1979. He gained prominence in the political landscape when he was elected to represent the riding of Bay of Quinte in the House of Commons of Canada during the 2021 Canadian federal election.[1]

Before his political career, Williams established himself as a successful entrepreneur in the hospitality industry. He currently holds the position of President at Williams Hotels, a company that manages several regional hotels. With his astute business acumen, Williams has contributed to the growth and development of the hospitality sector.

Prior to his venture into federal politics, Williams served as a dedicated member of Belleville City Council. However, driven by a strong desire to effect change at a larger scale, he chose to run in the federal election, leading to his resignation from the city council before completing his term.

In addition to his professional achievements, Ryan Williams cherishes his role as a devoted family man. He is happily married and takes great pride in raising his three children, providing them with love, support, and guidance.

With a firm commitment to public service and a wealth of experience in both business and local governance, Ryan Williams continues to serve the people of Bay of Quinte diligently in the House of Commons, striving to address their concerns and contribute to the betterment of his constituency and the nation as a whole.
