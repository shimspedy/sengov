Currently serving as the Member of Parliament for the riding of Perth—Wellington in the House of Commons of Canada, Nater has made significant contributions to his community and the nation at large.

Education and Early Life:

Nater was born in Logan Township, which is now part of the Township of West Perth. He grew up on a family pig farm, where he learned the values of hard work, responsibility, and community engagement. While pursuing his education at Carleton University, Nater seized the opportunity to gain practical experience in politics by working as a volunteer intern for MP Gary Schellenberger. This experience ignited his passion for public service, and he subsequently became Schellenberger's special assistant. Nater also served as an executive assistant to MPP Randy Pettapiece. Alongside his political endeavors, Nater worked as a grievance analyst with the Correctional Service of Canada and as a policy analyst at the Treasury Board of Canada.

He obtained a Bachelor of Public Affairs and Policy Management from Carleton University in 2007, followed by a Master of Public Administration from Queen's University in 2008. During this period, he also served as a lecturer at King's University College from 2012 to 2014. As an aspiring scholar, Nater pursued a Ph.D. in political science at Western University before deciding to run for Member of Parliament.

Municipal Politics:

In the 2010 Ontario municipal election, Nater successfully ran for the West Perth council as a representative for the Mitchell Ward.

Under his guidance, the committee embarked on a project to construct a new water tower in Mitchell, contributing to the improvement of the local infrastructure.

Federal Politics:

Nater's entrance into federal politics marked a new chapter in his public service journey. After securing the Conservative nomination for Perth—Wellington, previously held by the esteemed MP Gary Schellenberger, Nater emerged victorious in the 2015 Canadian federal election with 22,255 votes, garnering substantial support from his constituents.

During the 42nd Canadian Parliament, from February 17, 2016, to September 18, 2017, Nater held the position of Vice Chair of the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Official Languages. Notably, he voiced his concerns regarding the Liberal Government's appointment of Madeleine Meilleur as Official Languages Commissioner, deeming it a partisan decision and questioning the government's appointments process. Nater's expertise in parliamentary procedure earned him a reputation as an authority in the field.

On January 28, 2019, Nater introduced a bill to amend the Criminal Code of Canada, inspired by a criminal incident in Stratford. The bill aimed to enhance the protection of young people and individuals with disabilities against sexual exploitation, emphasizing Nater's commitment to safeguarding vulnerable members of society.

In the 2019 Canadian federal election, Nater was re-elected with an overwhelming majority, securing 25,622 votes and surpassing the runner-up Liberal candidate by more than 10,000 votes.

Throughout the 43rd Canadian Parliament, from November 28, 2019, to September 2, 2020, Nater served as the Deputy House Leader of the Official Opposition under the leadership of Andrew Scheer and later Erin O'Toole. He exhibited a keen focus on rural economic development, holding the role of Shadow Minister for Rural Economic Development starting September 8, 2020. Nater actively advocated for

 improved rural internet service, highlighting the need to address the digital divide that affects rural communities.

Nater secured his second re-election in the 2021 Canadian federal election, further solidifying his position as a trusted representative of his constituents. In the 44th Canadian Parliament, he assumed the role of Shadow Minister for Canadian Heritage on November 9, 2021. Nater vocally criticized the Liberal Government's Online Streaming Act and actively participated in the Heritage Committee's investigation of the Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal.

Beyond his legislative work, Nater actively engaged in party matters during the 2022 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. He endorsed Jean Charest and joined three other Conservative MPs in signing an open letter urging Charest to run for the leadership position. Although Charest ultimately came in second, Nater's support demonstrated his commitment to the Conservative cause.

In October 2022, Nater returned to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs as Vice Chair. His involvement in the committee's hearings on the Allegations of Chinese interference in the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections and the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution showcased his dedication to upholding the integrity of the electoral process.

From March 2022 to May 2023, Nater collaborated with Ontario Senator Robert Black to successfully pass Bill S-227, the Food Day Canada Act. This legislation pays tribute to Wellington County food activist Anita Stewart, a renowned culinary author, and aims to promote the celebration of Canadian food.

John Nater MP's inspiring journey in politics is characterized by a deep-rooted commitment to public service, diligent representation of his constituents, and a strong focus on parliamentary excellence. As he continues to serve as the Member of Parliament for Perth—Wellington, Nater remains dedicated to shaping a better future for his community and the nation as a whole.
