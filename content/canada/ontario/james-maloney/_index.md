James V. Maloney, a Canadian lawyer and politician, was born on July 16, 1964. He is widely known for his contributions in the legal and political arenas. Maloney's career took off after his successful election to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2015 election, where he represents the electoral district of Etobicoke—Lakeshore as a member of the Liberal Party caucus.

Education and Early Career

Maloney pursued his academic interests and earned law degrees from the University of Windsor and the University of Wales. Additionally, he holds a B.A. from Bishop's University. Before his entry into politics, Maloney built a solid foundation as a litigation lawyer, having been called to the Ontario Bar in 1996. He gained valuable experience working with Hughes Amys LLP, a reputable law firm.

Municipal Politics

In 2014, Maloney's dedication to public service led to his appointment as interim councillor representing Ward 5 (Etobicoke—Lakeshore) on the Toronto City Council. This opportunity arose after the resignation of Peter Milczyn from the council. Through his role, Maloney demonstrated his commitment to the betterment of his community.

Federal Politics

Building upon his success in municipal politics, Maloney became the Liberal Party candidate in Etobicoke—Lakeshore. Before his candidacy, he served as the president of the electoral district association. Maloney's dedication to public service resonated with the residents, and he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Etobicoke—Lakeshore in the 2015 election, aligning with the Liberal Party's near-sweep of the Greater Toronto Area.

Throughout his tenure, Maloney has actively contributed to various parliamentary committees. Since February 2016, he has held the position of Chair of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and has been a member of the Liaison Committee. Following the 2019 general election, Maloney was appointed as a member of the standing committee on Justice and Human Rights.

Furthermore, Maloney has assumed leadership roles within the political landscape. Since 2016, he has served as the Chair of the Toronto Government Caucus. Additionally, he holds the position of Chair of the Canada/Ireland Parliamentary Group and vice-chair of the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association. Moreover, he is a member of the Canada/United Kingdom Parliamentary Association and the Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association.

In 2016, Maloney faced criticism from community groups in south Etobicoke. They accused him of favoring the interests of his political allies, Mark Grimes and Justin Di Ciano, over those of local residents, following his encouragement for Metrolinx to drop an appeal of a rezoning decision made by the city council. However, Maloney successfully navigated these challenges and was re-elected in the 2019 Canadian federal election.

Maloney's dedication to promoting cultural heritage is evident in his work. In January 2020, he introduced a Private Member's motion proposing to declare March as Irish Heritage Month. This motion received widespread support and was adopted by the House of Commons on March 10, 2021, highlighting his commitment to celebrating and preserving cultural diversity.

In November 2020, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion released an investigative report, which found that Maloney had violated the Conflict of Interest Code for Members of the House of Commons by missing the deadline to disclose his private interests and those of his family members. Despite the report's recommendations for an apology, the House of Commons declined to accept the report in a vote by all Members of Parliament. Maloney subsequently issued an apology in the House of Commons on December 11, 2020, citing the COVID-

19 pandemic and miscommunication with the Ethics Commissioner as contributing factors.

Maloney's commitment to public service and his constituents was once again recognized in the 2021 Canadian federal election, where he was re-elected, solidifying his position as a dedicated representative.

Personal Life

Born and raised in Etobicoke, Maloney has maintained strong ties to the community throughout his life. He attended Michael Power High School, further deepening his roots in the area. Currently, he resides in south Etobicoke with his partner and their dog. Maloney comes from a family with a strong history of public service. His father, William Maloney, was appointed to the Supreme Court of Ontario in July 1975, while his mother, Marian Maloney, was appointed by Prime Minister Chretien to serve in the Canadian Senate in 1999. These familial influences have undoubtedly shaped his dedication to public service and community engagement.
