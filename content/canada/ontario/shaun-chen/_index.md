Shaun Chen MP, a Canadian politician, has dedicated his career to public service and making a positive impact on his community. Born on September 18, 1980, in Toronto, Chen's parents were of Hakka Chinese descent, originally from India. Growing up in Scarborough, Ontario, he developed a deep connection to his hometown and its residents.

Chen's educational journey began at Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute, where he laid the foundation for his future endeavors. He later pursued higher education at the University of Toronto, equipping himself with knowledge and skills to effect change in his chosen path.

Passionate about education and youth development, Chen became a trustee representing ward 21 in the Toronto District School Board. Recognized for his dedication and leadership, he was appointed as the Board Chair, demonstrating his commitment to improving the educational experiences of students in his community.

In 2015, driven by his desire to contribute on a broader scale, Chen made the decision to run as the federal Liberal candidate for the newly established Scarborough North riding. His bid for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada proved successful, and he was elected in the 2015 Canadian federal election.

Chen's political career gained momentum as he continued to serve his constituents diligently. He secured re-election in both the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, with an increasing share of the vote each time. This demonstrated the trust and support he garnered from the people he represented.

In addition to his political achievements, Chen has been recognized for his outstanding contributions to society. In 1999, he was awarded the Ontario Medal for Young Volunteers, highlighting his dedication to making a difference in the lives of others. In 2013, he received the esteemed Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, a testament to his exceptional service and commitment to public service.

Shaun Chen's life and career exemplify his unwavering dedication to public service and his community. Through his role as a Member of Parliament, he continues to advocate for the interests of Scarborough North and work towards a better future for all Canadians.
