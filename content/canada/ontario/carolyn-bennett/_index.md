A member of the Liberal Party, Bennett has represented Toronto—St. Paul's in the House of Commons since 1997. Throughout her career, she has held several ministerial positions, including Minister of State for Public Health from 2003 to 2006 and Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations from 2015 to 2021. Prior to her political career, Bennett worked as a physician for 20 years.

Early Life and Education:
Carolyn Ann Bennett was born on December 20, 1950, in Toronto, Canada. She attended Havergal College for her education. Bennett earned a degree in medicine from the University of Toronto in 1974 and became certified in family medicine in 1976. Her contributions to medicine, particularly in the field of women's health, were recognized when she received an honorary fellowship from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada in 2004.

Professional Career:
Before entering politics, Bennett dedicated two decades to her profession as a family physician. She practiced at Wellesley Hospital and Women's College Hospital in Toronto from 1977 to 1997. Additionally, Bennett was a founding partner in Bedford Medical Associates. She held leadership positions such as the president of the medical staff association of Women's College Hospital and served as an assistant professor in the department of family and community medicine at the University of Toronto. Bennett also actively participated on the boards of Havergal College, Women's College Hospital, the Ontario Medical Association, and the Medico-Legal Society of Toronto.

Bennett's expertise in healthcare was further demonstrated when she co-authored the book "Kill or Cure? How Canadians Can Remake their Health Care System" with Rick Archbold, which was published in October 2000.

Political Career:
Carolyn Ann Bennett embarked on her political journey by running for public office in the 1995 Ontario provincial election as a candidate of the Ontario Liberal Party. Although she did not secure a victory in that election, she successfully ran for a seat in the House of Commons in the 1997 federal election, representing the riding of St. Paul's. Bennett has been re-elected in subsequent elections, increasing her margins of victory in 2000 and 2004.

Following the appointment of Paul Martin as Prime Minister in 2003, Bennett assumed the role of Minister of State for Public Health on December 12, 2003. During her tenure, she played a crucial role in establishing the Public Health Agency of Canada, appointing the first chief public health officer, and establishing the Public Health Network.

Bennett has been an active member of various parliamentary groups, including the Canada-Israel Friendship Group from 1999 to 2003 and Liberal Parliamentarians for Israel. Throughout her career, she has served as the Official Opposition critic for social development, social economy, seniors, persons with disabilities, public health, Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development, and the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency.

On November 4, 2015, Bennett was appointed as the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, later renamed the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations. In this capacity, she became one of the most senior members of Justin Trudeau's cabinet. She was re-elected in 2019.

On June 24, 2021, Bennett issued an apology to Jody Wilson-Raybould for her response to a tweet regarding the government's handling of the discovery of unmarked graves at Marieval Indian Residential School. Wilson-Raybould criticized

 Bennett's response as "racist and misogynistic."
