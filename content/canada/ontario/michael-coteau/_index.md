Michael Joseph Coteau is a Canadian politician who has dedicated his career to public service. He currently serves as the Member of Parliament for Don Valley East in the House of Commons of Canada. Born in Huddersfield, England, Coteau's family moved to Canada in 1976 when he was a child, settling in Flemingdon Park, a low-income neighborhood in North York.

Coteau's upbringing in social housing shaped his perspective and fueled his commitment to improving the lives of marginalized communities. Despite financial challenges, he pursued higher education and attended Carleton University, where he earned a degree in history and political science. Following his studies, Coteau ventured abroad and taught English in South Korea, gaining valuable international experience.

Upon his return to Canada, Coteau embarked on a career in public service, starting as a Toronto District School Board Trustee for Ward 17. He successfully ran for this position in 2003, 2006, and 2010, advocating for important causes such as student nutrition, community use of educational spaces, and the integration of educational technology. Coteau spearheaded the 'Community Use of Schools' initiative, reducing user fees and promoting accessibility to school facilities for organizations working with children. He also championed nutritional changes in schools, combating student hunger and fostering healthier food programs.

Coteau's dedication to community service extended beyond his role as a trustee. He served as the executive director and CEO of a national adult literacy organization, focusing on empowering individuals through education. Additionally, he worked as a community organizer in the Malvern area of Scarborough, Ontario, collaborating with the United Way to address local needs. Coteau's entrepreneurial spirit led him to establish his own small business.

In 2011, Coteau transitioned to provincial politics, running for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the riding of Don Valley East. He secured a victory in the election, defeating his Progressive Conservative opponent by a significant margin. Coteau continued to represent his constituents in subsequent elections, winning re-election in 2014.

Coteau's commitment and leadership caught the attention of Premier Kathleen Wynne, who appointed him to her cabinet in 2013. Over the course of his tenure, Coteau held various ministerial positions, including Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport, and Minister of Community and Social Services. He played a pivotal role in the successful execution of the 2015 Pan and Parapan American Games and advocated for initiatives such as street hockey for children and anti-racism programs.

In 2018, Coteau secured his third election victory, defeating the deputy mayor of Toronto, Denzil Minnan Wong, in the North Toronto constituency. Determined to contribute to positive change, Coteau decided to run for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party in 2019. With a vision centered around restoring decency to politics, he campaigned passionately but ultimately placed second in the leadership convention, with Steven Del Duca emerging as the winner.

Following this setback, Coteau set his sights on federal politics. He resigned from the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in August 2021 to pursue the federal seat of Don Valley East, previously held by Yasmin Ratansi. Coteau's efforts paid off as he won the seat in the 44th Canadian general election, receiving a significant mandate from his constituents.

Michael Joseph Coteau's biography is a testament to his unwavering dedication to public service and his commitment to advocating for the rights and well-being of his constituents. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated his ability to effect meaningful change and continues to serve as a strong voice for his community in the House of Commons of Canada.
