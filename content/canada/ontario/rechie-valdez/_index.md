Rechie Valdez, a Canadian entrepreneur, television personality, and politician, was born around 1980. Her journey in the world of politics began when she was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2021 federal election, representing Mississaugaâ€”Streetsville as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. With this achievement, she became the first Filipino Canadian woman to hold a seat in the Canadian Parliament, following in the footsteps of former Manitoba Liberal MP Rey Pagtakhan.

Prior to her political career, Valdez gained experience in the financial sector for several years. However, her true passion led her to venture into the business world. She established her own baking business and showcased her skills on the popular television show The Big Bake, which aired on Food Network Canada. Valdez also demonstrated her talents as a host and producer of Fearlessly Creative, a television program broadcasted on Filipino TV.

Beyond her professional endeavors, Valdez cherishes her personal life. She is happily married to Christopher Valdez, and together they are proud parents of two children. In her leisure time, Valdez enjoys playing basketball, considering it more than just a hobby. She once organized a basketball fundraising event for the Montreal Children's Hospital and SickKids in Toronto, demonstrating her commitment to philanthropy and giving back to the community.
