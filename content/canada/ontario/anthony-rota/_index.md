Anthony Michael Gerard Rota MP was born on May 15, 1961, in North Bay, Ontario. He is a prominent Canadian politician and currently serves as the 37th and incumbent Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada since 2019. Rota is a member of the Liberal Party and represents the riding of Nipissing—Timiskaming as a Member of Parliament (MP).

Rota's political journey began at the municipal level, where he served as a city councillor for the North Bay City Council. During his time on the council, he chaired the city's planning and economic development committee, demonstrating his commitment to community growth and prosperity. With a strong desire to make a difference on a broader scale, Rota sought the federal Liberal nomination for Nipissing—Timiskaming in early 2004.

In the ensuing general election of June 2004, Rota emerged victorious, narrowly defeating Conservative candidate Al McDonald. This victory marked the start of his tenure as MP for Nipissing—Timiskaming. Rota was re-elected in both the 2006 and 2008 elections, solidifying his position as a representative of his constituents and gaining valuable experience within the Liberal Party.

Although he faced a setback in the 2011 election, losing by a mere 14 votes to Jay Aspin of the Conservative Party, Rota's dedication to public service remained unwavering. Following his defeat, he embarked on a teaching career at Nipissing University, where he shared his knowledge and passion for political science.

In 2015, Rota made a successful comeback as the Liberal candidate for Nipissing—Timiskaming, defeating Aspin and regaining his position as MP in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. He was further appointed Assistant Deputy Chair of Committees of the Whole on December 9, 2015, highlighting his commitment to parliamentary duties.

The year 2019 proved to be a significant turning point in Rota's political career. He was re-elected as the MP for Nipissing—Timiskaming and also emerged as the 37th Speaker of the House of Commons. His election as Speaker came after winning a ranked ballot, competing against notable candidates such as Joël Godin, Carol Hughes, Geoff Regan (the previous Speaker), and Bruce Stanton.

As Speaker, Rota has displayed a firm commitment to maintaining decorum and order in the House of Commons. On June 17, 2020, he made the decision to remove NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh from the House of Commons after Singh referred to Bloc Québécois MP Alain Therrien as a racist, demonstrating his impartiality and dedication to upholding parliamentary standards.

Rota's exceptional leadership and contributions were recognized by his re-election as Speaker of the House of Commons on November 22, 2021, for the 44th Parliament. His continued service in this esteemed position reflects his dedication to democracy, fairness, and effective governance in Canada.

Outside of politics, Rota has pursued academic achievements. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Wilfrid Laurier University, a diploma in finance from Algonquin College, and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Ottawa. Rota's linguistic abilities are commendable, as he is fluent in English, French, Italian, and Spanish. He also imparts his expertise as a political science sessional lecturer at Nipissing University.

Anthony Michael Gerard Rota MP's unwavering commitment to public service, strong leadership, and dedication to parliamentary excellence make him an influential figure in Canadian politics. As Speaker of the House of Commons, he continues to play a vital role in upholding the democratic principles and fostering effective governance in Canada.
