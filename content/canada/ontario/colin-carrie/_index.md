Colin Carrie, born on April 11, 1962, in Hamilton, Ontario, is a Canadian politician and a prominent figure in the Conservative Party of Canada. He currently serves as a Member of Parliament representing the riding of Oshawa in Ontario, Canada.

Carrie's early life was marked by a series of moves across different Canadian cities until he finally settled in Oshawa at the age of fifteen. He pursued his education at the University of Waterloo, where he obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Kinesiology. In 1989, he earned a Doctor of Chiropractic from the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, embarking on a successful career as a chiropractor before entering politics. Throughout his professional journey, Carrie has demonstrated his commitment to the well-being of his community and held various leadership positions, including executive member of the Durham Chiropractic Society, Chair of Spinal Health Week in Durham Region, and Financial Secretary of the Oshawa Knights of Columbus.

Carrie's political career began in 2004 when he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Oshawa in a closely contested three-way race, triumphing over the NDP candidate Sid Ryan and Liberal candidate Louise Parkes. During his tenure in the 38th Parliament, he served as a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health, showcasing his dedication to public health matters.

As a proponent of natural health products, Carrie reintroduced Private Member's Bill C-420, which aimed to amend the Food and Drugs Act to redefine the regulation of vitamins, minerals, and related products. While the bill garnered both support and criticism, Carrie remained steadfast in advocating for the interests of small producers within the health industry.

Carrie's electoral success continued in subsequent elections. He secured his seat in the 2006 and 2008 federal elections, facing strong competition from the NDP candidate Sid Ryan. Prime Minister Stephen Harper recognized Carrie's abilities and appointed him to the role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry in February 2006. Later, in November 2008, Carrie was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, further cementing his dedication to public service.

Throughout his career, Carrie has been a tireless advocate for his constituents, consistently winning their support. In the 2011 federal election, he achieved a historic victory, securing the largest margin of victory in Oshawa since the 1980 federal election. Carrie's commitment to his community led to his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment in September 2013.

In the 2015 federal election, Carrie once again emerged victorious, marking his fifth consecutive win in Oshawa. As part of the Official Opposition, he assumed the role of Deputy Critic for Health, later transitioning to the position of Official Opposition Critic for Health under interim Leader Rona Ambrose. When Andrew Scheer became the party leader, Carrie took on the international relations file, showcasing his versatility and breadth of knowledge.

Carrie's dedication to advancing meaningful legislation was evident in June 2019 when he presented Bill C-461, an act aimed at amending the Criminal Code and the Judges Act to combat trafficking in persons. Additionally, he collaborated with Lisa Freeman, an Oshawa resident, to draft Bill C-466, which sought to provide transparency to victims of violent crime and their families during the parole hearing process. Although both bills passed first reading, they did not become law due to the subsequent 2019 election.

Currently, Carrie serves as a member on the House of Commons Standing Committee for Veterans Affairs, further solidifying his commitment to supporting Canadian veterans.

In response to the introduction of a vaccine mandate in the House of Commons, Carrie claimed a medical exemption, participating in House meetings virtually to fulfill his

 parliamentary duties.

In February 2023, Carrie faced criticism for having dinner with Christine Anderson, a Member of the European Parliament representing Alternative for Germany, who holds Islamophobic and antisemitic positions. The meeting drew condemnation from various organizations and political figures, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Carrie, along with fellow Conservative MPs Leslyn Lewis and Dean Allison, released a joint statement expressing their lack of awareness regarding Anderson's views and unequivocally condemning racist and hateful ideologies.

Throughout his career, Colin Carrie has remained dedicated to his constituents, advocating for their interests and striving to make a positive impact in the political landscape of Canada.
