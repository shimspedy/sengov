Patricia A. Hajdu PC MP, born on November 3, 1966, is a Canadian politician who has made significant contributions to public service. She currently serves as the Minister of Indigenous Services, a role she assumed on October 26, 2021. Hajdu is an active member of the Liberal Party and represents the Thunder Bayâ€”Superior North electoral district in the Parliament of Canada. Throughout her career, she has held various ministerial positions, including Minister of Status of Women, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, and Minister of Health.

Hajdu's early life was marked by unique circumstances. Although born in Montreal, she spent her formative years in Chisholm, Minnesota, USA, under the care of her aunt and uncle. Alongside her brother, Sean Patrick Hajdu, she navigated a challenging upbringing. Her Hungarian surname originates from her stepfather.

At the age of 12, Hajdu relocated to Thunder Bay, Ontario, to live with her mother. However, due to a strained relationship, she found herself living independently by the age of 16 while striving to complete her high school education. Following her graduation, she secured employment through an employment insurance initiative in Thunder Bay, where she joined a non-profit adult-literacy organization and underwent graphic design training.

Hajdu pursued her higher education at Lakehead University, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. Her commitment to learning and public service led her to the University of Victoria, where she obtained a Master of Public Administration in 2015.

Throughout her professional career, Hajdu has actively engaged in areas related to harm prevention, homelessness, and substance misuse prevention. She notably served as the head of the drug awareness committee at the Thunder Bay District Health Unit for a span of nine years. Additionally, she worked as a creative director and graphic designer in the marketing field. Prior to her entry into politics, she held the position of executive director at Shelter House, the largest homeless shelter in Thunder Bay.

Hajdu's political journey began on November 4, 2015, when she was appointed as the Minister of Status of Women in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's federal Cabinet. In this role, she spearheaded initiatives such as convening an advisory council to develop Canada's strategy against gender-based violence. Subsequently, on January 10, 2017, she assumed the role of Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour.

On October 29, 2018, alongside Status of Women Minister Maryam Monsef and President of the Treasury Board and Minister for Digital Government Scott Brison, Minister Hajdu introduced pay equity legislation for federally regulated workplaces, demonstrating her commitment to promoting fairness and equality.

Following the 2019 federal election, Hajdu was appointed Minister of Health in the Trudeau government. From 2020 to 2021, she played a pivotal role in overseeing the Department of Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. These key agencies coordinated the Canadian government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which Hajdu implemented significant measures to safeguard public health. Notably, she invoked the Quarantine Act on March 25, 2020, mandating self-isolation for all returning travelers (excluding essential workers) and implementing necessary restrictions to protect vulnerable populations.

In the wake of the 2021 federal election, Hajdu transitioned from her role as Minister of Health to assume the position of Minister of Indigenous Services, where she continues to advocate for the rights and well-being of Indigenous communities.

Beyond her political career, Hajdu embraces her role as a mother and cherishes her two adult sons. Her personal life informs her dedication to building a better future for all Canadians.
