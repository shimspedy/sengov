Peter Fragiskatos MP, born on April 30, 1981, is a Canadian academic and politician affiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada. He has been serving as the Member of Parliament for the riding of London North Centre since his election in the 2015 federal election.

Coming from a family of Greek heritage, Fragiskatos draws inspiration from his grandmother, Panagiota, who immigrated to Canada from Greece after World War II. She actively engaged in politics and worked as an organizer for prominent leaders of the New Democratic Party, namely Tommy Douglas and Stephen Lewis. Fragiskatos credits his passion for politics and commitment to social justice to her influence. He pursued his education at the University of Western Ontario, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree. He then went on to complete a Master of Arts at Queen's University before earning his Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge, focusing his research on Kurdish human rights issues.

Fragiskatos successfully secured re-election as the Member of Parliament for London North Centre in the 2019 federal election, which took place on October 21, 2019. Since his initial election in 2015, he has held various significant committee appointments, contributing to the Canadian political landscape. Notable among these appointments are his roles in the Foreign Affairs and International Development committee from January 29, 2016, to September 18, 2017, and the Public Safety and National Security committee from September 18, 2017, to September 19, 2018. Fragiskatos also served on the Subcommittee on International Human Rights of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development from January 31, 2017, to September 11, 2019, and the Finance committee from September 19, 2018, to September 11, 2019, as well as from January 27 to August 18, 2020, and October 6, 2020, to August 15, 2021. His involvement also extended to the Canadaâ€“China Relations committee from January 15 to August 18, 2020, and October 6, 2020, to August 15, 2021, and the Public Accounts committee from December 9, 2021, to the present.

Recognizing his expertise and dedication to public service, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Fragiskatos to the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians on June 15, 2021. This appointment followed Fragiskatos obtaining a top-secret security clearance, a prerequisite for the position. The committee, chaired by the Honourable David J. McGuinty since its establishment in 2017, comprises representatives from both the House of Commons and the Senate. It operates with a non-partisan approach to review national security and intelligence activities undertaken by the Government of Canada. The committee was established under the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Act, which received Royal Assent on June 22, 2017.

During the 2021 federal election, held on September 20, Fragiskatos triumphed in his bid for re-election, securing a third term as the Member of Parliament for London North Centre. Subsequently, on December 3, 2021, Prime Minister Trudeau appointed him as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue.

Prior to his political career, Fragiskatos served as a professor of political science at Huron University College and King's University College, both part of the University of Western Ontario. He gained recognition as a knowledgeable commentator on international affairs and contributed to esteemed publications such as Maclean's, The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star, BBC News, and CNN.

Fragiskatos resides in the London North Centre riding with his wife, Katy, and their daughter

, Ava.
