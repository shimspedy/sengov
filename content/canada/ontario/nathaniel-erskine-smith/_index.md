He is affiliated with the Liberal Party and was elected to the House of Commons following the 2015 federal election. Prior to his political career, Erskine-Smith worked as a commercial litigation lawyer. On May 8, 2023, he announced his intention to run for the 2023 Ontario Liberal Party Leadership Election.

Early Life and Education:
Erskine-Smith was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. He attended Bowmore Elementary School and Malvern Collegiate. His parents, Sara Erskine and Lawrence Smith, were public school teachers. Erskine-Smith pursued his higher education at Queen's University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in politics in 2007. He then went on to complete his law degree in 2010. During his time at Queen's, Erskine-Smith ran as a candidate for city council in the 2006 municipal elections but was unsuccessful. He furthered his studies in political philosophy and constitutional law at the University of Oxford, earning a Master of Laws (BCL) degree in 2013.

Legal Career:
Following his studies, Erskine-Smith worked as an associate at Kramer Simaan Dhillon, specializing in commercial litigation. He had previously gained experience as a law student at Aird & Berlis LLP. Additionally, Erskine-Smith devoted his time to pro bono work, including a civil liberties case advocating for religious freedom in Ontario's school system. In a notable case, he successfully argued against compulsory religious studies in publicly funded high schools in Ontario.

Political Career - 42nd Parliament (2015-2019):
Erskine-Smith served as a member of the Public Safety and National Security Committee during his tenure in the 42nd Parliament. He also held the position of Vice-Chair of the Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics committee. In 2016, he served as the president of the Canadian group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, where he delivered a speech on youth in politics at a meeting in Zambia. Erskine-Smith gained recognition for his independence as a parliamentarian, often challenging party lines and advocating for free votes in the House of Commons.

Animal Welfare Advocacy:
Erskine-Smith has been a strong advocate for animal welfare throughout his career. In 2015, he seconded Bill S-203, the Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act, which became law in June 2019, prohibiting the captivity of cetaceans. He introduced Bill C-246, the Modernizing Animal Protections Act, in 2016, aiming to ban the import of shark fins and strengthen animal cruelty laws. Although the bill was defeated, it paved the way for subsequent government legislation. Erskine-Smith's efforts led to the establishment of the Liberal Animal Welfare Caucus in 2017. He has received several awards for his dedication to animal welfare, including the Humane Legislator Award from Animal Justice and the Fur-Bearers’ Clements Award.

Climate Action:
Recognizing the urgency of addressing climate change, Erskine-Smith called for an emergency debate on climate change in Parliament in response to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's special report in 2018. He introduced Bill C-454, the Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions Act, in 2019, advocating for Canada to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Drug Policy Reform:
Erskine-Smith has been a vocal supporter of drug policy reform, particularly advocating for the decriminalization of drug possession and treating drug

 use as a health issue. He has championed cannabis legalization and regulation and called for alternatives to incarceration for individuals possessing drugs solely for personal use. Erskine-Smith's efforts led to the creation of a Liberal caucus policy resolution addressing the opioid crisis through a public health approach.

Privacy Advocacy:
Erskine-Smith has been actively involved in privacy advocacy. He participated in various international committees and hearings to address privacy breaches by major tech companies. He introduced Bill C-413 to amend the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, granting more powers to the Privacy Commissioner to protect individuals' privacy rights. He has been a strong proponent of the right to be forgotten in the digital age.
