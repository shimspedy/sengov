Brian S. Masse MP, born on July 9, 1968, is a distinguished Canadian politician who has dedicated his career to public service. As a member of the New Democratic Party, he has made significant contributions in the House of Commons of Canada since his election in 2002, representing the esteemed riding of Windsor West.

Masse hails from Windsor, Ontario, where he was born and raised. He pursued higher education and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from Wilfrid Laurier University in 1991. His thirst for knowledge led him to further his studies at the University of Windsor, where he completed course work for a Master of Arts degree.

Before entering politics, Masse made a positive impact in his community through his involvement in various organizations. During the 1990s, he served as a job developer for the Association for Persons with Physical Disabilities, where he worked tirelessly to improve the lives of individuals with physical challenges. Additionally, he held the position of program coordinator for the Multicultural Council of Windsor and Essex County, promoting diversity and inclusivity in the region.

Masse's commitment to his community became evident when he gained local prominence in 1996 by actively opposing the establishment of a dance bar in a residential neighborhood. His advocacy demonstrated his dedication to protecting the well-being and interests of his constituents. In recognition of his efforts, Masse was elected to Ward 2 of the Windsor city council in 1997 and subsequently re-elected in 2000. In 1998, he played a vital role in preventing the opening of a rock-crushing operation in the Wellington Avenue area, safeguarding the local environment and quality of life.

In May 2001, Masse's influence extended to the Windsor city council, where his motion to prevent school boards from selling vacant property lots at the highest market value was unanimously approved. With this motion, he aimed to discourage school closures, although some critics argued that it conflicted with taxpayer interests. Masse's dedication to democratic decision-making was further evident when he called for a referendum on a proposed new arena project, demonstrating his belief in engaging the public in matters of significance.

On the personal front, Masse is married to Terry Chow, and together they have been blessed with a daughter named Alexandria, born on September 26, 2000, and a son named Wade, born on December 8, 2003. The support and love of his family have undoubtedly been instrumental in his political journey.

Masse's political career took a momentous turn in 1997 when he joined the federal New Democratic Party. In 2002, he secured his place in the Canadian parliament through a by-election held on May 13. The by-election was necessitated by the resignation of Herb Gray, a long-standing Liberal cabinet minister who had served as a Member of Parliament (MP) since 1962. Masse's victory was resounding, as he won the NDP nomination uncontested and defeated Liberal candidate Richard Pollock by a significant margin of 2,477 votes, earning the trust and support of the people.

Masse's commitment to his constituents and his remarkable performance led to his re-election by an even larger margin in the 2004 general election. His achievements can be partially attributed to the support he received from Joe Comartin, a fellow Windsor New Democrat who had been elected to the House of Commons in the 2000 federal election. In fact, Masse actively supported Comartin's bid for the NDP leadership during 2002-03, showcasing his loyalty and dedication to the party.

Throughout his parliamentary career, Masse assumed various roles, including serving as the NDP critic for Auto Policy, Canada Border Services, and Customs in the 38th Canadian

 parliament. He was also a member of the esteemed all-party "Border Caucus," which focused on examining different aspects of Canada-U.S. trade relations. Masse displayed his commitment to social justice by introducing a motion in 2004 to restrict large pharmaceutical companies from renewing their patent protection, working diligently to ensure affordable AIDS drugs were accessible in Africa, alongside Stephen Lewis's efforts.

Masse's political trajectory was not without challenges. During his initial campaign for the House of Commons, the Windsor Star newspaper criticized him as a "bench-warmer, a yes-man, a political careerist." However, Masse quickly dispelled these notions, surpassing expectations and rapidly establishing himself as a competent and hard-working representative who stayed attuned to the needs of his constituents. A leading columnist from the Windsor Star acknowledged Masse's exemplary performance, highlighting his dedication to serving the community.

In the 2006 federal election, Masse was re-elected with an increased majority over Liberal Werner Keller. He assumed the role of NDP Deputy Industry Critic, leveraging his expertise to contribute meaningfully to policy discussions. Furthermore, Masse and Comartin expressed their concerns when the provincial NDP removed Canadian Auto Workers leader Buzz Hargrove from the party, demonstrating their commitment to upholding principles and advocating for the interests of workers.

Masse has consistently demonstrated his commitment to safeguarding Canadian industries and ensuring their prosperity. He openly criticized Industry Minister Maxime Bernier's plans to deregulate Canada's telecommunications market and relax restrictions on foreign ownership, warning about potential monopolistic control and the adverse effects on the industry.

In recognition of his valuable contributions and expertise, Masse was appointed to the NDP frontbench as the critic for Innovation, Science, and Economic Development in 2015. This prestigious position reflects his deep understanding of the crucial intersection between innovation, scientific progress, and economic growth.

Masse's unwavering dedication to public service and his tireless efforts to advocate for his constituents earned him another re-election in the 2019 Canadian federal election. His triumph over former Liberal MPP Sandra Pupatello further solidified his position as a respected representative and an influential voice within the New Democratic Party.

Brian S. Masse MP's exceptional career has been marked by his commitment to social justice, his relentless pursuit of fairness and equality, and his unwavering dedication to the well-being of his community and the nation at large. As a seasoned politician, he continues to shape policy, contribute to parliamentary discussions, and strive for a better future for all Canadians.
