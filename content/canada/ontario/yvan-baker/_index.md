Yvan Baker MP, born on December 8, 1977, is a Canadian politician renowned for his dedication and commitment to public service. He represents the federal riding of Etobicoke Centre, having been elected in the 2019 federal election. Baker is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada and has made significant contributions to both federal and provincial politics.

Growing up in the West End Toronto neighborhood of Etobicoke, Baker's early years shaped his passion for community engagement and public service. He received his education at the prestigious Toronto French School and later earned a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) from the Schulich School of Business at York University. With a keen interest in finance and economics, Baker embarked on a career with Scotiabank before taking on the role of Executive Assistant to Borys Wrzesnewskyj, the Member of Parliament for Etobicoke Centre at the time. During this period, he recognized the value of higher education and pursued a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the renowned Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.

Baker's professional journey continued as he joined the Boston Consulting Group, a prestigious management consulting firm, where he worked out of their New York and Toronto offices. Leveraging his expertise and knowledge, he later established his own consultancy based in Toronto. Additionally, Baker contributed to academia by teaching Master of Business Administration students at the Schulich School of Business, York University.

In addition to his professional endeavors, Baker has been deeply committed to charitable initiatives and community projects. He served as a board director for organizations such as Leave out Violence, the Emerging Leaders Network, and Global Grassroots. Notably, his work with Global Grassroots involved supporting emerging female leaders in Rwanda, addressing critical issues such as access to water, domestic violence, and health education. Baker's remarkable efforts in these areas were recognized when he was awarded the prestigious Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.

In his personal life, Yvan Baker is in a relationship with Amanda Simard, a former Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for the provincial riding of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.

Baker's political career began at the provincial level when he was elected as the Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for the riding of Etobicoke Centre in 2014. During his tenure, he served as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance, Charles Sousa, and also held the position of parliamentary assistant to Deb Matthews, president of the Treasury Board. Baker played an instrumental role in various legislative roles, including serving as the parliamentary assistant to the Minister Responsible for Digital Government, a commissioner on the Board of Internal Economy, and the vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs.

Known for his proactive approach to public policy, Baker introduced several private members' public bills in the Ontario Legislature. One notable bill was the Ontario Flag Day Act, 2015, which successfully proclaimed May 21 of each year as Ontario Flag Day, garnering unanimous support from all three parties. Another significant contribution was the Pathways to Post-secondary Excellence Act, aimed at facilitating high school students' research into post-secondary educational institutions by centralizing data on admissions, student experience, and outcomes. While this bill received endorsements from prominent organizations such as the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance and the Canadian Federation of Students, it did not advance beyond the first reading. Baker also proposed the Phones Down, Heads Up Act in 2017, which sought to penalize pedestrians for texting while crossing the street. Although this bill generated debates and criticism, it sparked essential conversations about road safety.

Deeply invested in his local community, Baker initiated and hosted the annual Community Recognition Awards in Etobicoke Centre, which

 celebrated individuals and organizations making a positive impact. These awards encompassed various categories, including Outstanding Volunteer Service to the Community, Outstanding Volunteer Service to Seniors, Outstanding Volunteer Service to the Community by Youth, and Outstanding Service by Professional Staff. Furthermore, Baker co-hosted the Government and Community Services Fair each year, providing a platform for over 110 exhibitors from the provincial government, agencies, and community organizations to connect with the public. He also conducted monthly Seniors Advisory Group meetings to address topics of importance to seniors in Etobicoke Centre.

Building upon his success in provincial politics, Yvan Baker set his sights on federal politics. On October 30, 2018, he announced his intention to seek the Liberal Party of Canada nomination for the federal riding of Etobicoke Centre, continuing his dedication to serving the community and making a positive impact at the national level.
