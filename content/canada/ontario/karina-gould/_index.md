Early Life and Career
Karina Gould was raised in Burlington, Ontario, in a family with three brothers. Her paternal grandparents were Czech Jews who survived the Holocaust, while her mother is German and met her father while on a kibbutz in Israel. Growing up, Gould developed an early interest in politics and governance. At the age of sixteen, she participated in the Forum for Young Canadians, an experience that ignited her passion for a career in Parliament. After graduating from M.M. Robinson High School in 2005, she devoted a year to volunteering at an orphanage in Mexico, where she met her future husband, Alberto Gerones.

Gould went on to attend McGill University, where she earned a joint honors degree in Political Science and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. During her undergraduate years, she excelled academically and served as the president of the Arts Undergraduate Society (AUS). Additionally, she played an active role in organizing fundraising efforts for humanitarian aid in Haiti following the devastating 2010 earthquake. Gould's commitment to social causes and her academic achievements laid a strong foundation for her future endeavors.

Following her graduation, Gould embarked on a career in international relations, starting as a consultant in the Migration and Development Program at the Organization of American States in Washington, D.C. She contributed to the 2011 report titled "International Migration in the Americas: First Report of the Continuous Reporting System on International Migration in the Americas (SICREMI)," showcasing her expertise and dedication to promoting international cooperation.

Driven by her passion for global affairs, Gould pursued a master's degree in International Relations at Oxford University. Upon completing her graduate studies, she decided to return to her hometown of Burlington, Ontario. Gould took on a role as a Trade and Investment Specialist for the Mexican Trade Commission "ProMexico" in Toronto, gaining valuable experience in the field.

Political Career
In 2015, at the age of twenty-eight, Karina Gould made her foray into Canadian politics by announcing her candidacy in the federal election. Her campaign garnered attention when a three-year-old tweet expressing her opposition to the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines and the development of the Alberta tar sands resurfaced. Despite this controversy, Gould emerged victorious, defeating the Conservative incumbent Mike Wallace with 46% of the vote.

Gould's dedication and commitment to public service quickly became apparent. Shortly after her election, she was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development and La Francophonie on December 2, 2015. In this role, she championed important causes such as empowering women and girls through a feminist approach to foreign aid.

On January 10, 2017, Gould achieved a significant milestone in her career when she was named the Minister of Democratic Institutions, making her the youngest female Cabinet minister in Canadian history. In this capacity, she took on the responsibility of strengthening Canada's democratic institutions, addressing cyber threats, and combating foreign interference. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in the passage and defense of Bill C-76, the Elections Modernization Act, which introduced crucial amendments to the Canadian Elections Act.

The 2019 Canadian federal election saw Gould successfully re

elected, further solidifying her position as a respected representative of her constituents. Her growing support in Burlington contributed to her party's achievement of a minority government. Following the election, Gould assumed the role of Minister for International Development, where she continued to contribute to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's foreign policy objectives. Her responsibilities included overseeing Canada's sponsorship of the World Health Organization and engaging in discussions with Dr. Tedros Adhanom, WHO's director-general.

Gould's dedication to public service led to her appointment as the Minister of Families, Children, and Social Development on October 26, 2021. In this capacity, she has been entrusted with shaping policies and programs that directly impact the lives of Canadians, with a particular focus on families, children, and social development.

Personal Life
Karina Gould married her husband, Alberto Gerones, in 2011. Their union has been a source of support and strength throughout her political journey. On March 8, 2018, Gould made history as the first sitting federal Cabinet minister to give birth while in office when she welcomed her son Oliver into the world. Her commitment to balancing her personal and professional life has inspired many and highlighted the importance of gender equality and family-friendly policies in the political arena.
