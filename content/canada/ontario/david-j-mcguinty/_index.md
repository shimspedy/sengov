David Joseph McGuinty PC MP, born on February 25, 1960, is a Canadian lawyer and politician. He has dedicated his career to public service and currently serves as the Member of Parliament for Ottawa South, a position he has held since 2004. McGuinty is affiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada and has been elected or reelected seven times, with his most recent victory in the 2021 federal elections.

Growing up in Ottawa, Ontario, David McGuinty was born into a family of twelve. His parents, Dalton McGuinty Sr., a politician and professor, and Elizabeth McGuinty (née Pexton), a full-time nurse, instilled in him the values of public service from a young age. Being raised in a bilingual household with a Francophone mother and an Anglophone father, McGuinty is fluent in both English and French.

McGuinty pursued his education diligently, acquiring a diverse range of qualifications. He began with a Diploma in Agriculture from the Kemptville College of Agriculture and went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from the University of Ottawa. Furthering his studies, he specialized in Civil and Comparative Law at Université de Sherbrooke in Quebec, obtained a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Ottawa, and finally achieved a Master of Laws from the London School of Economics and Political Science.

With a strong background in environmental law, McGuinty has always been actively engaged in Liberal politics. He was appointed as the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Prime Minister's National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, a government think-tank focused on sustainable development.

In his personal life, McGuinty is part of a distinguished political family. His brother is Dalton McGuinty, a former Ontario Premier, and his father was Dalton McGuinty Sr., a former Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in Ontario. David McGuinty is married to Brigitte Bélanger, and together they have four children.

Throughout his political career, McGuinty has made significant contributions in various capacities. During his initial tenure in government from 2004 to 2006, he served on the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development. Additionally, he held the role of chairman of the Liberal Party's National Capital Region Caucus.

Transitioning to the opposition from 2006 to 2015, McGuinty took on significant responsibilities. He became the Official Opposition critic for Transport in 2006, endorsed Michael Ignatieff in the 2006 Liberal leadership contest, and assumed the role of critic for Environment with the election of Stéphane Dion as the Liberal Party leader in January 2007. Following the appointment of Michael Ignatieff as the leader, McGuinty served as the critic for Environment and Energy. In September 2010, he was promoted to the position of Opposition House Leader. After Michael Ignatieff's resignation, Bob Rae, the Interim leader, named McGuinty as the Liberal Party's Critic for Natural Resources in June 2011.

Despite rumors of his leadership aspirations, including during the 2008 and 2011 Liberal leadership contests, McGuinty decided not to seek the party's leadership. He expressed his consideration of a bid for the leadership at the Liberal Party's biennial convention in January 2012 but ultimately confirmed in November 2012 that he would not pursue it.

McGuinty's contributions extend beyond Canada's borders as well. In 2012, he was elected to lead the Canadian chapter of Globe International, an international alliance of lawmakers focused on addressing global environment and economy challenges. He also participated in the National Democratic Institute's Pre-Election Assessment Mission to Ukraine in the same year.



Throughout his career, McGuinty has faced some controversies. In 2012, he made anti-Alberta comments following a meeting of the Natural Resources Committee, causing criticism from the Conservative party. McGuinty later apologized for his remarks and resigned as Natural Resources critic. Another controversy arose in 2014 when the Conservative Riding Association accused him of being a "part-time" Member of Parliament, although they were unable to provide evidence due to the House of Commons not keeping attendance records.

David McGuinty's unwavering dedication to public service, his expertise in environmental law, and his contributions to Liberal politics have shaped his successful career as a lawyer and politician. As the Member of Parliament for Ottawa South, he continues to serve his constituents and advocate for their interests at the national level.
