Judy A. Sgro PC MP, born on December 16, 1944, is a Canadian politician known for her extensive career in public service. She is a prominent member of the Liberal Party of Canada and currently represents the electoral district of Humber River—Black Creek in the House of Commons of Canada. Sgro holds significant positions within the Canadian government, serving as the chair of the Standing Committee on International Trade and as a Chair on the Canadian House of Commons Liaison Committee since 2016.

Sgro's journey in politics began in 1987 when she was elected to the North York City Council. Her dedication and commitment to public service led to her acclaimed position as a Metro Councillor for North York in 1994. Later in 1998, she became a Toronto City Councillor after the amalgamation of cities, where she served as the vice-chair of the Toronto Police Services Board.

In the realm of federal politics, Sgro initially faced a setback in 1997 when she narrowly lost the election for the riding of York South—Weston to John Nunziata, who ran as an independent candidate. However, she emerged victorious in a by-election held in 1999 for the riding of York West, filling the seat left vacant by Sergio Marchi, who had accepted an ambassadorial position to the World Trade Organization. Sgro has since been re-elected multiple times with significant pluralities.

During her political career, Sgro has held several notable roles. In 2001, she was appointed as the chairperson of the Prime Minister's "Caucus Task Force on Urban Issues," showcasing her expertise in urban affairs. In 2003, her task force released an interim report recommending increased federal support to recognize the economic and social value of urban areas. From December 12, 2003, to January 13, 2005, Sgro served as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in the government of Paul Martin, contributing to important policies and decisions in that domain.

Sgro faced a challenging period marked by controversy in 2004. The media spotlight focused on her during the "Strippergate" scandal, which raised questions about her activities during the June election of that year. Opposition MPs accused Sgro of granting a special immigration permit to a campaign supporter, which generated significant public and media attention. Despite the controversy, an investigation conducted by the Federal ethics commissioner, Bernard Shapiro, cleared Sgro of any wrongdoing, emphasizing her lack of knowledge regarding the actions of her staff. The commissioner concluded that she had acted appropriately in the given circumstances. Sgro's resilience and commitment to serving her constituents prevailed, and she continued her political career.

In 2010, Sgro faced another challenge when it was revealed that she had been claiming expenses for rent on an Ottawa luxury condominium owned by her adult children, violating rules set by the Board of Internal Economy of the House of Commons. Despite this controversy, Sgro addressed the issue promptly and emphasized the need for similar accountability from other politicians.

After the Liberal Party transitioned to the opposition in 2006, Sgro served as the Opposition Critic for Industry, contributing to the formulation of retirement income security recommendations and the Pension Income Bill of Rights. In 2014, she was re-nominated as the Liberal candidate for the newly renamed riding of Humber River—Black Creek, and subsequently won election to represent the constituency.

Sgro's dedication to public service and her constituents has earned her recognition and support. She currently holds the position of chair of the Standing Committee on International Trade, where she continues to contribute to crucial trade discussions and decisions. Sgro was re-elected in the 2019 federal

 election, reaffirming her commitment to serving the people of Humber River—Black Creek.

In her personal life, Sgro is married to Sam Sgro, and together they have three children. Her daughter, Deanna Sgro, has followed in her footsteps and pursued a career in politics, running as a candidate for the Ontario Liberal Party during the 2018 Ontario general election and the 2018 Toronto municipal election for Humber River-Black Creek.
