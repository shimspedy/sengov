Eric Duncan MP, born on October 7, 1983, is a prominent Canadian Liberal politician who has made a significant impact in the political landscape. His dedication and commitment to public service have earned him a respected position as a Member of Parliament representing the Glengarry—Prescott—Russell riding in the House of Commons of Canada since the 2015 federal election.

Growing up in Hawkesbury, Ontario, Drouin developed a strong sense of community and a passion for making a difference. After completing his diploma in business administration from La Cité collégiale, he furthered his education at the University of Ottawa, where he earned a bachelor's degree in commerce. His academic achievements laid a solid foundation for his future endeavors in politics.

Drouin's political journey began at a young age when he joined the Liberal Party at 17. Demonstrating his natural leadership skills, he served as the president of the Young Liberals in Glengarry—Prescott—Russell for two years. During this time, he played a pivotal role in managing the Liberal campaigns for the 2011 federal and 2014 provincial elections, showcasing his strategic abilities and dedication to the party's values.

In January 2015, Drouin emerged as the federal Liberal nomination for the 2015 federal election, setting the stage for a significant milestone in his political career. With unwavering determination and strong support from the community, he secured a resounding victory, unseating the three-term Conservative incumbent Pierre Lemieux by an impressive margin of over 10,000 votes.

Throughout his tenure in the House of Commons, Drouin has been a vocal advocate for the interests and concerns of his constituents. His tireless efforts and unwavering commitment to public service have earned him recognition and respect from both his colleagues and the Canadian public.

Recognizing his exemplary leadership qualities and expertise, Drouin was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food on December 3, 2021. In this role, he continues to champion agricultural issues and play a crucial role in shaping policies that impact Canada's vital agricultural sector.

While Drouin has achieved significant success in his political career, he has also faced challenges along the way. In April 2018, he was involved in a controversy when allegations arose accusing him of groping a woman at a Halifax bar during the Liberal Party policy convention. Drouin vehemently denied the allegations, asserting that he was misidentified. After a thorough investigation, the police did not lay any charges, and the matter eventually subsided.

Eric Duncan MP remains steadfast in his dedication to serving the people of Glengarry—Prescott—Russell and making a positive impact on the Canadian political landscape. His journey is a testament to his unwavering commitment to public service and his ability to overcome challenges while working tirelessly to create a better future for his constituents and the nation as a whole.
