Alex Ruff MSC CD MP, born in 1974, is a distinguished Canadian politician and retired military officer. He currently serves as the Member of Parliament for the riding of Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound in the House of Commons of Canada, having been elected in both the 2019 and 2021 federal elections.

Ruff's early years were spent on a farm just outside of Tara, Ontario, where he grew up as the eldest of five boys. He received his education at Arran-Tara Elementary School and Chesley District High School. In 1997, he graduated with honors from the Royal Military College of Canada, majoring in space science.

During his impressive 25-year military career, Ruff served as an infantry officer in The Royal Canadian Regiment. He was stationed at various locations, including Garrison Petawawa, Kingston, CFB Gagetown, Canadian Forces College in Toronto, and the headquarters of Canadian Special Operations Forces Command and Canadian Joint Operations Command in Ottawa. Throughout his service, Ruff participated in six operational deployments. These included Operation Recuperation, providing aid during the ice storm in eastern Ontario and western Quebec in 1998, as well as two missions as part of the Stabilization Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Operation Palladium) in 1998–99 and 2001. Additionally, he served twice on Operation Athena in Kandahar and Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. His most recent deployment was as part of Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve in Baghdad, Iraq, from 2018 to 2019. Ruff retired from the Canadian Armed Forces in early 2019, leaving behind a legacy of dedicated service and exemplary leadership.

In April 2019, Ruff embarked on a new path in politics and secured the Conservative nomination for the riding of Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound in the 2019 federal election, following the retirement of Larry Miller. Subsequently, on October 21, 2019, he was elected as a Member of Parliament. From February to August 2020, Ruff served as a member of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs. Recognizing his capabilities, Erin O’Toole appointed him to the Conservative Party House Leadership team as the Deputy Opposition Whip on September 2, 2020, a role in which he dutifully served until November 2021. Demonstrating the trust and support of his constituents, Ruff was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound on September 20, 2021.

Ruff's commitment to public service is evident in his active involvement in parliamentary committees. Since December 9, 2021, he has been an esteemed member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities (HUMA). Additionally, since December 13, 2021, Ruff has served as a member on the Special Committee on Afghanistan (AFGH), highlighting his dedication to addressing critical matters of national importance.

Through his distinguished military career and dedicated service as a Member of Parliament, Alex Ruff has proven himself to be a tireless advocate for his constituents and a trusted leader in both the military and political realms. His unwavering commitment to serving his country and community has earned him the respect and admiration of colleagues and constituents alike.
