He also contributed to his community through his involvement in the municipal council of West Nipissing and the Conseil scolaire de district catholique du Nouvel-Ontario. In 2010, he even sought the mayoral position in Greater Sudbury during the municipal election. However, he withdrew his candidacy before election day.

Within the House of Commons, Serré has fulfilled various roles and responsibilities. He has served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Official Languages, working to promote linguistic diversity and inclusivity in Canada. He has also held the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources, contributing to the sustainable development and management of the country's natural resources. Furthermore, Serré served as the co-chair of the Indigenous Caucus alongside MP Robert-Falcon Ouellette, a historic caucus formed in 2015, representing the interests and concerns of Indigenous communities across Canada.

Marc G. Serré MP has dedicated himself to public service and has played an active role in advancing important issues within the Canadian political landscape. Through his positions in Parliament, he has worked to promote linguistic rights, foster responsible resource management, and advocate for the rights and well-being of Indigenous communities.
