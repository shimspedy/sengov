Terry Sheehan MP, born in 1970, is a Canadian politician currently serving as the Member of Parliament for Sault Ste. Marie in the House of Commons of Canada. He was first elected in the 2015 federal election and subsequently re-elected in the 2019 and 2021 federal elections.

Before his career in federal politics, Sheehan dedicated his service to the Sault Ste. Marie community in various capacities. From 2003 to 2015, he represented Ward 2 on the Sault Ste. Marie City Council. Prior to that, he served as a Trustee on the Huron-Superior Catholic District School Board for two terms.

During the 42nd Parliament, Sheehan made significant contributions as a member of several parliamentary committees. He served on the International Trade Committee and the Industry, Science, and Technology Committee. Additionally, Sheehan held the esteemed position of co-chair of the Canada-Japan Interparliamentary Group. He also served as the Chair of the Northern Ontario Liberal Caucus and was a member of the All-Party Steel Caucus. Sheehan's commitment extended to international relations, as he held positions on the Executive Committees of the Canada-Ireland and Canada-Italy Interparliamentary Groups.

In the 43rd Parliament, Sheehan's talents and dedication were recognized as he was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages. In this role, he assumed responsibility for the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario.

Continuing his political journey, Sheehan secured re-election to the 44th Parliament of Canada in the 2021 federal election. With his ongoing commitment to public service, Sheehan strives to represent the interests and concerns of his constituents in Sault Ste. Marie at the national level.
