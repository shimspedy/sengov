Iqra Khalid MP, born on November 20, 1985, is a prominent Canadian politician who has made significant contributions to public service. She was elected to represent the riding of Mississaugaâ€”Erin Mills in the House of Commons of Canada in the 2015 federal election, marking the beginning of her impactful political career.

Born in Pakistan, Khalid's family relocated to England in 1993, where her father pursued his PhD. In 1998, they immigrated to Canada, settling in Mississauga, where her parents established a small family business. Iqra, along with her three brothers, actively assisted in the store's operations while attending school, fostering a strong work ethic and an understanding of entrepreneurship from an early age. She pursued higher education at York University, where she earned a degree in criminology and professional writing in 2007. During her time as a student, Khalid served as the media ambassador for the York University Student Alumni Program.

After graduating, Khalid gained valuable experience working at an immigration firm before deciding to pursue a Juris Doctor degree at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School. For her final thesis, she conducted a comparative analysis on the impact of culture on the governance and regulation of nations, using business law in the USA, Canada, India, and China as case studies. Khalid graduated with honors distinction in 2012 and returned to Canada to serve as an articled clerk for the city of Mississauga, further expanding her knowledge and expertise in the legal field.

Khalid's political journey began in December 2014 when she secured the nomination to become the Liberal Party of Canada's candidate for the Mississauga-Erin Mills riding. In the subsequent 2015 federal election, she emerged victorious, defeating the two-term Conservative MP Bob Dechert. Her success marked a significant milestone as one of two Pakistani-Canadian women elected to the House of Commons in that election, alongside fellow Liberal Salma Zahid. Khalid's dedication and commitment to serving her constituents were recognized again when she was re-elected in both the 2019 and 2021 elections.

Throughout her political career, Khalid has held various significant roles and responsibilities. Presently, she serves as the Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy, and Ethics (ETHI) and as a member of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP). She has previously chaired the Standing Committee of Justice and Human Rights and served on the Foreign Affairs and International Development Subcommittee on International Human Rights (SDIR). Additionally, she has served as Chair of the Liberal Women's Caucus and the All-Party Women's Caucus, exemplifying her commitment to promoting gender equality and women's rights.

Khalid's passion for justice is evident in her work as a member of the Standing Committee of Justice and Human Rights. She has actively engaged in debates and studies concerning crucial topics such as Access to Justice, Physician Assisted Dying legislation, Transgender Rights legislation, Genetic Discrimination, and Online Hate in Canada, among others. Notably, in 2017, Khalid tabled a successful motion to undertake a study on human trafficking. The committee's subsequent report, titled "Moving Forward in the Fight Against Human Trafficking in Canada," contained recommendations aimed at supporting victims and bringing traffickers to justice.

Demonstrating a strong commitment to human rights, Khalid has been a vital member of the Subcommittee for International Human Rights. She has participated in major studies addressing human rights violations in countries such as Peru, Vietnam, Syria, Iraq, Burundi, Mauritania, China, and Venezuela, as well as the issue of sex trafficking in South Asia. Her 201

6 motion to study the plight of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar resulted in Canada becoming one of the first countries to recognize the genocide committed against them. Additionally, Khalid has sponsored petitions, including E609, which urged the Canadian government to assist the residents of Aleppo affected by the Syrian crisis.

In December 2016, Khalid introduced a private members motion that called for the development of a strategy to tackle systemic racism and religious discrimination. This motion, in response to a petition condemning Islamophobia in Canada, received two-thirds majority approval and led to a commissioned study by the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. The resulting report paved the way for a $23 million investment in anti-racism and anti-discrimination initiatives. Khalid's efforts to combat Islamophobia were further highlighted when she testified before the Senate of Canada's Standing Committee on Human Rights in 2023, sharing her personal experiences and shedding light on its impact on Canadians.

For her outstanding work in the field of human rights, Khalid was recognized as one of Chatelaine's Women of the Year in 2017, further solidifying her reputation as a dedicated advocate for equality and justice. In recent years, Khalid, along with members of the International Human Rights Subcommittee, conducted a study on the Uyghur community's plight, ultimately concluding that the actions against them amounted to genocide.

Iqra Khalid MP continues to be a strong and influential voice in Canadian politics, striving to address critical issues, promote human rights, and create a more inclusive and equitable society for all. Her unwavering dedication and commitment to public service make her a respected figure both within her community and on the national stage.
