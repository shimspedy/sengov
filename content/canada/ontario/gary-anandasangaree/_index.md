Sathiyasangaree "Gary" Anandasangaree MP, known as a Sri Lankan Tamil Canadian lawyer, human rights activist, and politician, has dedicated his life to advocating for justice and equality. Born into a prominent political family, he has made significant contributions to the Tamil community and beyond.

Anandasangaree's journey began with his upbringing in a politically active household. His father, V. Anandasangaree, was a respected Sri Lankan Tamil politician. However, when his parents separated in 1980, Anandasangaree and his mother decided to leave Sri Lanka and seek a new life elsewhere. Unfortunately, their plans to return were disrupted by the devastating Black July anti-Tamil riots in 1983. They changed their course and eventually settled in Canada on August 31, 1983. Since then, Anandasangaree has had limited contact with his father, having met him only twice since their departure.

Education played a vital role in shaping Anandasangaree's career. After completing high school, he pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science at Carleton University, graduating with honors in 1996. Anandasangaree went on to study law at the prestigious Osgoode Hall Law School, part of York University. He obtained his LL.B. degree in 2005 and was called to the bar in 2006. With his legal expertise, he established Gary Anandasangaree and Associates, a distinguished law firm in Toronto specializing in business, real estate, and international human rights law.

Throughout his career, Anandasangaree has been actively involved in various community organizations and initiatives. He has served as the president of the Canadian Tamils' Chamber of Commerce and provided legal counsel to the Canadian Tamil Congress. He also held leadership positions in organizations such as the Canadian Tamil Youth Development Centre, the Newcomer Grants for the United Way of Greater Toronto, and the Toronto Board of Trade. Anandasangaree's commitment to fostering entrepreneurship and small business growth led him to lecture at the Centennial College Centre for Small Business and Entrepreneurship.

Anandasangaree's unwavering dedication to human rights has been a driving force behind his activism. He has been a prominent campaigner against human rights abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War and has actively participated in sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council. Sadly, his advocacy has led to unfounded accusations from Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists, who have labeled him as a member of the militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). However, during the 2015 federal election campaign, even LTTE supporters openly endorsed Anandasangaree's conservative opponent, highlighting his commitment to a peaceful and inclusive approach.

Anandasangaree's passion for justice eventually propelled him into the political arena. He joined the Liberal Party and, in October 2013, announced his intention to seek the Liberal Party nomination for the Scarboroughâ€”Rouge Park riding in the 2015 federal election. After winning the nomination election in August 2014, he emerged victorious in the general election held on October 19, 2015, garnering an impressive 60.1% of the votes.

As a Member of Parliament, Anandasangaree has continued his tireless advocacy for human rights. He has actively participated in parliamentary discussions, using his platform to address pressing issues such as the welcoming of Syrian refugees and the protection of an Iranian scholar, Dr. Hossein Raessi, through a joint program between Carleton University and the University of Ottawa. Additionally, Anandasangaree has served on the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development committee in the 42nd Canadian Parliament, further showcasing his commitment to justice and inclus

ivity.

Recognizing his unwavering dedication and expertise, Anandasangaree was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada on December 3, 2021. This prestigious position reflects his significant contributions and further empowers him to make a meaningful impact on legal and justice matters in Canada.

Sathiyasangaree "Gary" Anandasangaree MP's remarkable journey from his early life as the son of a prominent politician to his current role as a leading advocate for human rights and justice exemplifies his unwavering commitment to making a positive change in the world. His dedication, expertise, and relentless pursuit of justice have established him as a notable figure in both the legal and political arenas, making him a source of inspiration for many.
