Krystina Helena Jaczek, PC MP is a Canadian physician and Liberal politician. She currently serves as the Member of Parliament for Markham—Stouffville in the House of Commons of Canada and holds the position of Minister of Public Services and Procurement and Receiver General for Canada.

Krystina Jaczek was born in England to a Polish father and an English mother. She immigrated to Canada in 1963 at the age of 12. She pursued her education in the field of medicine, obtaining a medical degree and Masters of Health Science from the University of Toronto. Later, she earned a Masters of Business Administration from York University. Jaczek worked as a general practitioner at Women's College Hospital in Toronto and served as the chief medical officer of health in York Region for 18 years. Throughout her career, she has been involved with various community agencies, serving on their boards.

Jaczek's political career began in provincial politics. In 2007, she was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing Oak Ridges—Markham. She continued to serve in this position until 2018. During her tenure, she held several important roles, including Minister of Community and Social Services from 2014 to 2018 and Minister of Health and Long-Term Care in 2018, under the leadership of Kathleen Wynne.

In 2019, Jaczek entered federal politics and ran as a Liberal Party of Canada candidate in the riding of Markham—Stouffville in the 2019 Canadian federal election. She won the election and became a Member of Parliament. During her time in the 43rd Canadian Parliament, Jaczek introduced a private member's bill focused on establishing a national strategy for health data collection.

As a member of the Standing Committee on Health, Jaczek made significant contributions to Canada's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her expertise in medicine and public health proved valuable in advocating for funding transparency, improved safety measures, and better public health standards.

In October 2021, Jaczek was appointed as the Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario) in the Cabinet of Canada. She also serves as the Vice-Chair of the Treasury Board and holds positions in various Cabinet Committees.

On August 31, 2022, Jaczek swapped portfolios with Filomena Tassi, taking on the role of Minister of Public Services and Procurement and Receiver General for Canada. This cabinet shuffle occurred at Tassi's request, as she wished to have a lighter workload to attend to a family health matter.
