Scott Aitchison MP, born on January 14, 1973, is a Canadian politician known for his contributions in both municipal and federal politics. He currently represents the riding of Parry Soundâ€”Muskoka in the House of Commons of Canada, having been elected in the 2019 Canadian federal election. Aitchison began his political career as the mayor of Huntsville, a position he held from 2014 to 2019.

Before entering politics, Aitchison worked in sales at Coldwell Banker Thompson Real Estate and Fowler Construction. He also served as a consultant with Enterprise Canada Group from 1998 to 2004. Aitchison's commitment to public service extended beyond politics, as he co-chaired the organizing committee for the 2012 Ontario Para Winter Games in Huntsville.

Aitchison's involvement in municipal politics began in 1994 when he was elected to the Huntsville Town Council at the age of 21. He served three terms as a Councilor and became the youngest individual ever elected to both the Huntsville Town Council and the Muskoka District Council at the time. In 2010, he was re-elected as a District and Town Councilor and later served as the Deputy Mayor for four years. Aitchison's successful political career continued as he was elected mayor in 2014 and re-elected in 2018, serving the office until October 28, 2019.

In the federal political arena, Aitchison secured the Conservative nomination in 2019, defeating three other candidates. Subsequently, he emerged victorious in the general election held later that year. His re-election in 2021 led to his appointment to the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet as the Shadow Minister for Labour.

A notable achievement in Aitchison's federal career came in December 2021 when he collaborated with Liberal Minister Seamus O'Regan to incorporate an extension of bereavement leave for grieving parents who work in federally regulated industries into Government Bill C-3. This partnership showcased rare cross-party support, as Aitchison's previously tabled private member's bill was integrated into the government's legislation.

Aitchison's leadership aspirations became evident when, on March 3, 2022, it was reported that he was preparing a bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada. Focusing his campaign on character and tone, he officially launched his bid on March 20 at a rally in Huntsville. Despite his efforts, Aitchison placed last with 1% of the vote in the leadership election held on September 10, with Pierre Poilievre emerging as the winner.

Aitchison has been vocal about various political issues throughout his career. He expressed concern about the growing polarization in Canada during the Canada convoy protest, urging politicians to find compromise and avoid fostering hatred. In his leadership campaign, Aitchison presented a comprehensive plan, titled "YIMBY: A Plan to Build More Homes for Canadians," to address the housing crisis in Canada. His plan aimed to end exclusionary zoning, increase tradespeople through education and immigration, boost affordable and social housing, and combat money laundering in the real estate sector.

He has also taken a stand against Bill 21, the 2019 Quebec Act respecting the laicity of the State, asserting that it violates freedom of religion. Aitchison believes that every Canadian should have the right to express their religious beliefs, including wearing religious symbols at work.

Aitchison has shown support for CANZUK, an alliance proposal between Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, aimed at enhancing trade, foreign policy, and military cooperation. He has led cross-party working groups to facilitate discussions on freer movement and trade among these partner countries.

Address

ing issues pertinent to his constituents, Aitchison has raised concerns about rural broadband and advocated for increased competition in the market and federal investment in underserved areas. Regarding the environment, he advocates for a credible federal climate change plan that encourages industry innovation in reducing emissions, while opposing a carbon tax that he believes disproportionately affects lower-income Canadians in rural areas.

In a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ2S+ community, Aitchison joined fellow MPs from various political parties in releasing a statement on the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia. Through a tweet, he affirmed the belonging and importance of individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Scott Aitchison MP continues to be an influential figure in Canadian politics, actively working towards addressing pressing issues and promoting inclusivity and cooperation.
