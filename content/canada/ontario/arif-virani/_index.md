Within the House of Commons, Virani represents his riding as a member of the Liberal Party. Over the years, he has held several parliamentary secretary portfolios, including his current role as the parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice and attorney general since 2018. Previously, he served as the parliamentary secretary to the minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship from 2015 to 2017, and to the minister of Canadian heritage (multiculturalism) from 2017 to 2018.

Background
Arif Virani's roots can be traced back to Ahmedabad, Gujarat, although he was born in Kampala.[1] He is a multilingual Ismaili Muslim who arrived in Canada as a refugee from Uganda.[2] In 1972, Virani and his family found refuge at the Stanley Street YMCA in Montreal before eventually settling more permanently in Toronto.[2] He spent his childhood growing up in the Flemingdon Park and Willowdale neighborhoods.[3]

Education
Virani completed his joint honours Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and history at McGill University in 1994.[4] Subsequently, he pursued his legal studies at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law, where he obtained his law degree.[5] Even after graduation, Virani maintained his connection with the University of Toronto Faculty of Law by staying involved with its alumni committee.[6]

Legal Career
Arif Virani embarked on his legal career by articling for Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP in 1999.[4] Following this experience, he spent a year in London, United Kingdom, supported by the prestigious Harold G. Fox scholarship.[4] This scholarship, awarded to recent graduates of the Bar Admission Course, offered him the opportunity to undergo pupilage with leading Barristers at the Inns of Court in London, United Kingdom.[7][8] In 2003, he joined the constitutional law branch of the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, where he worked as a lawyer.[4][9] While currently serving as a Member of Parliament, Virani no longer practices law. However, he remains a licensed lawyer of the L1 class, recognized by the Law Society of Ontario, which entitles him to practice law in Ontario as a barrister and solicitor.[10][11]

Personal Life
Arif Virani resides in Toronto's Roncesvalles Village with his wife, Suchita Jain, originally from London, Ontario, and their two sons.
