Michael Morrice MP, born on July 22, 1984, is a Canadian politician who has been serving as the member of Parliament (MP) for Kitchener Centre since 2021. He is affiliated with the Green Party and made history by becoming their first MP elected in Ontario and the second MP elected outside of British Columbia.

Early Life and Career

Morrice spent his early years on Montreal's West Island until his family relocated to Newmarket, Ontario in 1997. He pursued higher education at Wilfrid Laurier University, where he successfully earned a dual degree in business and computer electronics in 2003. Recognizing the importance of sustainable economics and green initiatives, Morrice ventured into creating positive change. In 2008, he founded Sustainable Waterloo Region, followed by Green Economy Canada in 2013, focusing on promoting environmentally friendly practices and sustainable growth.

Political Journey

In the 2019 federal election, Morrice emerged as the Green Party's candidate for Kitchener Centre. Despite facing tough competition from incumbent Liberal MP Raj Saini, Morrice managed to significantly increase the Green Party's vote share from 3 percent to an impressive 26 percent. It was during this campaign that Morrice revealed his battle with cancer, demonstrating his resilience and dedication to public service.

2021 Election

While serving as a social entrepreneur in residence at Wilfrid Laurier University, Morrice decided to participate in the 2021 federal election. Once again, he went head-to-head against Raj Saini, who later faced serious allegations of sexual harassment from his staffers. Saini eventually suspended his campaign, although he remained on the ballot due to the candidate nomination deadline. Notably, influential members of the Liberal Party in the region expressed their support for Morrice. On election day, Morrice emerged victorious, securing his place in Parliament with an impressive 34 percent of the vote.

Michael Morrice MP's political journey has been defined by his commitment to sustainability, economic growth, and public service. His achievements in promoting green initiatives and his ability to connect with constituents have established him as a prominent figure in Canadian politics. As the representative for Kitchener Centre, Morrice continues to work towards a greener and more sustainable future for his constituents and the entire country.
