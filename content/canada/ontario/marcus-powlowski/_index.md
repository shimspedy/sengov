Powlowski's expertise was further recognized by the World Health Organization, where he served as a health legislation consultant. He generously shared his knowledge as an educator, teaching Global Health at Lakehead University and the University of San Francisco, and Global Health Law at Lakehead University Faculty of Law [4].
