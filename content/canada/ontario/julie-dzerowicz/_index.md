Juliana Roma "Julie" Dzerowicz MP, widely known as Julie Dzerowicz, is a Canadian politician and prominent member of the Liberal Party. She has been diligently serving as the Member of Parliament for the Toronto riding of Davenport since her initial election in 2015. Demonstrating her unwavering support and commitment to her constituents, she was reelected in both 2019 and 2021, securing a strong mandate to continue representing her community's interests.

Dzerowicz embarked on her academic journey by earning a bachelor's degree in commerce from McGill University, where she displayed exceptional leadership skills and actively engaged in various leadership positions. Her passion for learning and broadening her horizons led her to Institut Commercial de Nancy in France, where she completed her final term. Recognized for her outstanding contributions to the McGill community, she was honored with the esteemed Scarlet Key Award, a prestigious accolade reserved for individuals who exhibit exceptional qualities of leadership, perseverance, and selflessness.

Fueling her intellectual pursuits, Dzerowicz pursued a Master of Business Administration degree at the University of British Columbia (UBC), where she also contributed to the UBC Senate. She further expanded her knowledge and expertise by completing her degree at the prestigious London Business School, solidifying her aptitude in the realm of business.

Before assuming her parliamentary role, Dzerowicz made significant strides in various sectors. In 2007, she co-founded Project Neutral, an environment charity committed to promoting sustainable practices. She also played a pivotal role as a founding board member of JUMP Math, a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing numeracy skills among students.

Dzerowicz's professional experience encompasses diverse roles that have shaped her well-rounded approach to politics. Notably, she served as the director of strategic planning and communication at the Bank of Montreal, contributing her expertise in navigating complex challenges and communicating effectively. Additionally, she worked as a senior political staffer to former provincial cabinet minister Gerry Phillips, gaining valuable insights into the political landscape. Her involvement as the vice-chair of the Platform Committee for the Ontario Liberal Party and her contributions to the field of biotechnology further exemplify her commitment to public service.

As a Member of Parliament, Dzerowicz has been steadfast in championing various causes close to her heart. After a rigorous nomination process, she secured the Liberal Party of Canada's nomination for the riding of Davenport, making history as the first female Member of Parliament representing the area.

Throughout her tenure, Dzerowicz has demonstrated her dedication to promoting equality and social progress. In February 2021, she introduced a private member's bill, Bill C-273, urging the Minister of Finance to develop a comprehensive national strategy for a guaranteed basic income. This bold initiative reflects her unwavering belief in creating a fair and just society for all Canadians.

In her pursuit of transparency and engagement with constituents, Dzerowicz reached out to the public through the popular discussion website Reddit in June 2021. While this endeavor earned her praise for her advocacy of increased funding for affordable housing and universal basic income, she faced criticism for inaccurately stating the duration of the 2020 Port of Montreal strike on Twitter. However, her commitment to addressing pertinent issues, such as the government's legal battle with survivors of Canada's residential school system, was acknowledged and appreciated.

In the aftermath of the 2021 Canadian Federal Election, Dzerowicz emerged victorious once again, securing her position as the representative for Davenport. Despite a recount requested by her opponent, she triumphed by a narrow margin of 76 votes, cementing her strong connection with her constituents and their trust in her leadership.

In her role as the chair of the Liberal Immigration caucus, Dzerowicz demonstrated her dedication to the well-being

 of newcomers to Canada. Responding to internal criticism about delays in processing immigration claims, she acknowledged the need for improvement and pledged to work diligently towards rectifying the situation, reinforcing her commitment to fostering an inclusive and welcoming society.

Julie Dzerowicz's biography showcases her remarkable journey as a passionate and dedicated politician. With her steadfast determination and commitment to public service, she continues to be a prominent voice for her constituents, advocating for meaningful change and striving to create a better future for all Canadians.
