Mark Holland PC MP, born on October 16, 1974, in Pickering, Ontario, is a Canadian politician and Government House Leader. He is a member of the Liberal Party and represents the riding of Ajax in the House of Commons. Known for his dedication and political acumen, Holland has served his constituents with distinction, holding various positions throughout his career.

Holland's political journey began when he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2004 federal election, representing the riding of Ajax—Pickering. He was subsequently re-elected in the 2006 and 2008 elections, but faced defeat in 2011. Undeterred, Holland briefly pursued work with the Heart and Stroke Foundation before making a triumphant return to politics in the 2015 election, winning the seat for Ajax.

With a strong educational background, Holland majored in political science and history at the University of Toronto, where he graduated in 1996. He gained valuable experience working as an assistant to Member of Parliament Dan McTeague and at the Ontario Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration. Additionally, he contributed to the financial sector, working for the Royal Bank of Canada and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

Having deep roots in west Durham, Holland resides in Ajax, a place he has called home for his entire life. His commitment to public service extends beyond the federal level, as he previously served as a city councillor for the city of Pickering from 1997 to 2004. Furthermore, he played a vital role as a councillor for the Regional Municipality of Durham from 2000 to 2004.

During his tenure as a city councillor, Holland spearheaded several initiatives, leaving a lasting impact on his community. Notably, he established the Millennium Waterfront Committee in Pickering, leading the successful redevelopment of Pickering's waterfront. He also founded the Region of Durham's Youth Partnership Initiative, championed the City of Pickering's Winterfest, and served as a board member for Veridian Corporation. Additionally, Holland contributed to various organizations, including the Durham Region Police Services Board, Ajax-Pickering Social Development Council, Ajax-Pickering Block Parent program, and Durham Region's finance and administration committee. He remains an active member of the Durham West Arts Centre, having been one of its founding members.

Within federal politics, Holland has been an integral part of the Liberal Party of Canada and the House of Commons. His commitment to public service is evident through his roles as vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Safety and National Security Committee. He has also taken on several critic positions, advocating for Natural Resources, Public Works and Procurement, and the Canada Border Services Agency. Holland has been actively involved in key committees, including the Finance Committee, Industry Committee, Public Accounts Committee, Government Operations Committee, and the Cities and Communities Caucus.

Noteworthy among his accomplishments is Holland's efforts to promote the cause of lowering the voting age in Canada. He introduced a private members bill advocating for 16- to 18-year-olds to be allowed to vote in federal elections, encouraging similar changes at the provincial and municipal levels. Holland also emphasized the importance of educating high school students about elections and current events, believing that informed choices could result in increased voter turnout.

Throughout his political career, Holland has earned recognition for his sharp wit and effectiveness in question period. The Globe and Mail referred to him as a member of the new 'Rat Pack,' and the Hill Times voted him as the most effective Opposition MP in Question Period. He has engaged in spirited exchanges with Conservative Minister Stockwell Day, earning nicknames like 'Perry Mason on Steroids' and 'the Caped Crusader.' Media outlets, including CTV and Maclean's, have commended

 Holland's dedication and labeled him as a force for change.

Holland has actively supported leadership campaigns within the Liberal Party, serving as the Ontario campaign chair for Gerard Kennedy and Ontario co-chair for Michael Ignatieff. He has held significant critic positions, including Natural Resources in Stéphane Dion's shadow cabinet and Public Safety and National Security. In the latter role, he led the opposition's criticism of the government's handling of the G8 Summit, efforts to save the gun registry, and the Conservative Party's crime agenda.

Despite a temporary setback in 2011 when he lost his seat, Holland emerged stronger, openly discussing the personal challenges he faced during that time. Following his defeat, he dealt with personal struggles, including an attempted suicide, acknowledging the toll it took on him. Nevertheless, he found resilience and went on to become the director of health promotion and public affairs with the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. Holland later served as the executive director for the Ontario Mission and national director of children and youth before his return to federal politics in 2015.

In the 2015 election, Holland secured the Liberal nomination for the newly formed riding of Ajax. Riding the wave of the Liberal surge in southern Ontario, he won back his seat with an impressive 56 percent of the vote, defeating the incumbent MP, Chris Alexander.

Recognizing his talents and dedication, Holland was appointed as the parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Democratic Institutions in December 2015. In January 2017, he transitioned to the role of parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. His remarkable work ethic and commitment were rewarded in August 2018 when he was promoted to the position of chief government whip, succeeding the previous whip, Pablo Rodriguez.

Throughout his political career, Mark Holland has shown unwavering dedication to his constituents and the Canadian people. His resilience and commitment to public service have been commendable, as he strives to make a positive difference in the lives of those he represents.
