Kevin Vuong MP (born c. 1989) is a Canadian politician who has been serving as the member of Parliament (MP) for Spadina窶認ort York since the 2021 federal election, sitting as an Independent. Despite initially being nominated as a Liberal Party candidate, Vuong was disavowed by the party just days before the election due to ongoing legal issues. The reports included a lawsuit against him and a dropped sexual assault charge from 2019, which he had failed to disclose during the party's vetting process. However, as nominations had already closed, Vuong remained on the ballot as a Liberal candidate and was subsequently elected.

Before entering politics, Vuong had a background in the business and finance industry and also served as a reserve officer in the Royal Canadian Navy. He comes from a family of Vietnamese refugees and grew up in Brampton, Ontario.

Vuong's involvement in public service started when he was selected as a member of the Canadian Y20 delegation to the 2013 G20 Summit. In this role, he led negotiations for two working groups and presented a final report on combating global tax havens to world leaders, including Vladimir Putin.

In 2015, Vuong joined the Canadian Forces Naval Reserve as an intelligence officer and later transferred to the public affairs branch. He was promoted to the rank of Sub-Lieutenant in 2021 and served as a public affairs officer at HMCS York. In recognition of his potential, he was named a NATO 2030 Young Leader for Canada, becoming the only Canadian representative among 13 other leaders advising on the future of the NATO alliance.

Vuong's political career began in municipal politics, where he advocated for various issues such as congestion pricing, youth equity, and police governance reform. He fought for the empowerment of young people in decision-making processes and organized events focused on sustainability and inclusivity in Toronto.

During the 2018 Toronto City Council campaign, Vuong ran for Ward 10 Spadina窶認ort York, emphasizing the need for services and infrastructure in downtown areas, as well as climate adaptation and action for vertical communities. Despite facing pressure to withdraw from the race, he continued his campaign and received an endorsement from the Toronto Sun.

In the 2021 Canadian federal election, Vuong was expected to be the Liberal Party candidate for Spadina窶認ort York following the retirement announcement of the incumbent MP. However, his candidacy was overshadowed by reports of an ongoing lawsuit and a previously dropped sexual assault charge. Despite the controversy, Vuong chose to stay in the race and was elected to Parliament. He decided to sit as an Independent following his victory, as the Liberal Party had disallowed him from sitting as a Liberal MP.

Vuong's victory was met with significant controversy due to the timing of the scandal becoming public knowledge after advance polls and mail-in ballots had already begun. Various party leaders, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, expressed concerns and called for investigations into the allegations. The Department of National Defence also reviewed Vuong's file, resulting in charges for failing to disclose the initial sexual assault charge to his chain of command.

As an MP, Vuong has been an advocate for combating racism, particularly anti-Asian hate, and has called for stronger government actions in this regard. He has also been involved in addressing the Russian invasion of Ukraine and was among the Canadian officials and parliamentarians sanctioned and banned by Russia.

Throughout his political career, Kevin Vuong has faced significant challenges and controversies, but he remains committed to serving his constituents as an Independent MP and addressing the important issues facing his community and the country as a whole.
