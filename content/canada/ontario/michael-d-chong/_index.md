Michael David Chong PC MP was born on November 22, 1971, in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. He has dedicated his career to serving the people of Canada as a politician and has been a Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Ontario riding of Wellington—Halton Hills since 2004. Chong is a member of the Conservative Party of Canada and has held various positions of influence within the party and the government.

Chong's political journey began in 2000 when he ran for parliament as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the federal election. Although he finished third in his first attempt, he remained dedicated to his political aspirations. When the Progressive Conservatives merged with the Canadian Alliance to form the Conservative Party of Canada in 2004, Chong joined the newly formed party and won the nomination for Wellington—Halton Hills.

Known for his Red Tory views, Chong quickly made his mark within the Conservative Party. In 2006, he was appointed to the cabinet of Prime Minister Stephen Harper as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Minister of Sport, and President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. During his time in cabinet, Chong worked on important issues such as Canada's equalization formula, health promotion, and amateur sports.

Chong's dedication to public service and his commitment to his constituents have been evident throughout his career. He has been a strong advocate for rural Ontario, expressing concerns about depopulation and supporting initiatives such as door-to-door rural mail service. Chong has also been actively involved in his local community, serving on various boards and organizations, including The Dominion Institute, the Groves Memorial Hospital, and the Elora Festival.

In addition to his political career, Chong has a diverse educational and professional background. He studied philosophy, history, and politics at Trinity College, University of Toronto. Before entering politics, he worked in information technology for Barclays Bank and Research Capital Corporation. Chong also worked as a senior technology consultant for the Greater Toronto Airports Authority and the National Hockey League Players' Association.

Chong is married to Carrie Davidson, and they have three sons. His wife has a rich family history in Canadian politics, with ancestors who were prominent figures in Newfoundland and Quebec. The couple resides on a farm in Fergus, Ontario, where they enjoy the peaceful rural lifestyle.

In 2017, Chong sought the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada. Although he finished in fifth place out of fourteen candidates, his campaign was notable for his support of a revenue-neutral carbon tax and his endorsement of Motion 103, which aimed to condemn Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination.

Throughout his parliamentary career, Chong has remained dedicated to his principles and has not been afraid to take a stand on issues that align with his beliefs. His commitment to a united and undivided Canada was evident when he resigned from cabinet in 2006 due to his opposition to recognizing "the Québécois as a nation within a united Canada."

Chong's contributions to Canadian politics have not gone unnoticed, as he has been recognized both domestically and internationally. However, his dedication to serving the Canadian people and advocating for their interests remains his primary focus. Despite facing personal challenges, such as being targeted by sanctions in response to his stance on human rights issues, Chong continues to work tirelessly for his constituents and for a better Canada.
