Yasir Abbas Naqvi MP, born on January 25, 1973, is a Canadian politician known for his significant contributions to public service. He has been serving as the member of Parliament (MP) for Ottawa Centre since the 2021 federal election, representing the Liberal Party. Naqvi's political journey began in Ontario provincial politics, where he held several key positions, including Attorney General of Ontario (2016–2018), Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services (2014–2016), and Minister of Labour (2013–2014). During this time, he also represented Ottawa Centre in the Legislative Assembly.

Born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan, Yasir Naqvi moved to Canada with his family in 1988 at the age of 15, seeking a new beginning. They settled in the Niagara Falls area of Ontario, where Naqvi pursued his education at McMaster University and the University of Ottawa Law School. In 2001, he was called to the Bar in Ontario and began practicing law, specializing in international trade, at Lang Michener LLP. His dedication and expertise in his field led to his eventual partnership at the firm. In 2007, Naqvi joined the Centre for Trade Policy and Law at Carleton University, broadening his impact and influence in matters of trade.

Naqvi's commitment to public service and community welfare has been evident throughout his career. Before entering politics, he volunteered with various community associations, including the Centretown Community Health Centre and the Ottawa Food Bank, demonstrating his genuine concern for the well-being of others.

Recognized as a rising star in Canadian politics, Yasir Naqvi has received numerous accolades and acknowledgments. The Ottawa Citizen named him as one of its "People to Watch in 2010," emphasizing his dynamic and impactful presence. Ottawa Life magazine also included him in its Tenth Annual "Top 50 People in the Capital" list for 2010. Known for his exceptional work ethic, Naqvi earned the reputation of being one of the hardest-working constituency Members of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in the province, as noted by Adam Radwanski in a September 2011 column in The Globe and Mail.

In 2007, Naqvi ventured into provincial politics as the Liberal candidate for the riding of Ottawa Centre in the provincial election. He secured victory against the New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate, becoming the representative for the constituency. Naqvi's success continued as he was re-elected in 2011 and 2014, solidifying his position as a trusted representative of Ottawa Centre.

Throughout his tenure in provincial politics, Naqvi served in various capacities, holding important positions within the government. Notably, he was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, Minister of Revenue, and Minister of Education. As an MPP, Naqvi actively introduced several significant bills, including the "Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act," the "Escaping Domestic Violence Act," and the "Protection of Public Participation Act," showcasing his dedication to social progress and community well-being.

While Naqvi faced some controversy in 2013 when a Toronto Sun article suggested his endorsement of an Islamist book on domestic violence, he firmly denied having endorsed the book and stated his condemnation of violence against women. He made it clear that he did not share the views expressed in the book and that his support was solely for the author's achievement in publishing a book.

In February 2013, when Kathleen Wynne assumed the role of Premier, she appointed Naqvi as Minister of Labour, further highlighting his leadership capabilities. Following the June 2014 election, Naqvi took on additional responsibilities as Minister of Community Safety and Correction

al Services and Government House Leader. His tenure as Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services attracted some criticism regarding the conditions and human rights violations in provincial prisons.

On June 13, 2016, Naqvi took on the role of Attorney General following a cabinet shuffle, demonstrating his extensive legal expertise and commitment to justice.

In the June 2018 Ontario general election, Naqvi sought re-election but was unsuccessful, finishing second behind New Democrat Joel Harden.

Undeterred by this setback, Naqvi transitioned to federal politics and successfully ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in Ottawa Centre in the September 2021 federal election. With 45.5% of the popular vote, he won his seat comfortably and became an MP. In his federal role, he was chosen to serve as Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness.

Driven by his passion for public service, Naqvi made the decision to resign from his role as a Parliamentary Secretary in March 2023 to explore the possibility of running in the 2023 Ontario Liberal Party leadership election. On June 3, 2023, he officially announced his candidacy for the leadership and has yet to indicate whether he will resign from his federal seat. Naqvi's dedication to serving the public and advocating for positive change continues to shape his career and impact Canadian politics.
