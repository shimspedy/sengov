Pamela Damoff, a Canadian Liberal politician, was born on March 13. She embarked on a remarkable political career, ultimately representing the riding of Oakville North—Burlington in the House of Commons of Canada after being elected in the 2015 federal election.

Born in London, Ontario, Pamela's upbringing was shaped by her father's role as vice-president of a manufacturing company and her mother's dedication as a homemaker. She pursued higher education at the University of Western Ontario, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1980. Following her studies, she delved into a successful 27-year career in financial and investment banking. In the last 11 years of her professional journey, she transitioned into a self-employed consultant, devoting herself to community work. Since 1992, Pamela has made Oakville her home.

Pamela's political journey began in 2010 when she was elected to the Oakville Town Council, representing Ward 2. Her dedication and accomplishments led to her re-election in 2014. During her tenure on the council, she served on the Oakville Public Library Board, the budget committee, and the Oakville Tourism Partnership. Pamela's commitment to active transportation and the improvement of cycling infrastructure in Oakville earned her recognition as a passionate advocate. Additionally, she served as the chair of Oakville's Terry Fox Run and the Oakville Santa Claus Parade.

The path to federal politics opened up unexpectedly for Pamela when Max Khan, the initial Liberal Party candidate for Oakville North—Burlington, passed away suddenly in March 2015. With a need to find a new candidate, Pamela announced her candidacy for the nomination on April 29, 2015, with the support of Khan's father. Through her determined efforts, she secured the nomination and subsequently won a closely contested general election.

In December 2015, Pamela's dedication and competence earned her the role of vice-chair of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women. However, her commitment to public service did not come without personal challenges. In April 2019, she fainted at her desk in the House of Commons during question period, highlighting the demanding nature of her role.

Pamela's political journey continued with her re-election in the 2019 election, which solidified her position as a trusted representative of her constituents. Shortly after her re-election, she was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indigenous Services, Marc Miller. This appointment exemplifies Pamela's dedication to addressing the needs and concerns of Indigenous communities.

Throughout her career, Pamela Damoff has shown a deep commitment to public service and community development. With her unwavering passion and dedication, she continues to serve as an influential figure in Canadian politics, working diligently to bring about positive change for her constituents and the country as a whole.
