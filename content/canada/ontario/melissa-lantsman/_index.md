Melissa Lantsman is a Canadian politician and public relations executive who has made significant contributions to the political landscape of Canada. She currently serves as the Member of Parliament for Thornhill in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the Conservative Party of Canada. Melissa's political career took off when she was elected in the 2021 Canadian federal election, marking a new chapter in her journey.

Melissa Lantsman holds the distinction of being the first openly gay and first Jewish woman ever elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament. Her groundbreaking achievements have paved the way for greater diversity and representation within the party.

Prior to her political career, Melissa worked as a communications advisor to several cabinet members in the 28th Canadian Ministry under Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Her expertise and strategic thinking made her an invaluable asset to the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario during the 2018 Ontario provincial election, where she served as a senior advisor and chief spokesperson.

Throughout her career, Melissa has honed her skills in public relations and strategic communications. She held positions such as the National Vice President of Public Affairs at Enterprise Canada, a renowned strategic communications firm. Her ability to navigate the complexities of public affairs has earned her recognition and respect in the field.

Melissa's decision to pursue a career in politics was driven by a deep passion for public service. In 2020, she announced her intention to seek the federal Conservative nomination in Thornhill, ultimately winning the candidacy after defeating the incumbent Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament, Gila Martow.

On September 20, 2021, Melissa Lantsman emerged victorious in the federal election, securing her seat in Parliament. Shortly after, she was sworn into office on October 28, ready to represent the interests of her constituents. Since November of that year, she has taken on the role of Shadow Minister of Transport in the Opposition Shadow Cabinet led by Erin O'Toole.

Melissa's commitment to public service extends beyond her role as a Member of Parliament. She was elected as the vice-chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport and Infrastructure, allowing her to contribute her expertise to critical discussions on transportation matters.

Melissa Lantsman's early life and education provided a solid foundation for her successful career. Born in Toronto in 1984 to a Russian Jewish family, Melissa was raised in Thornhill, the community she now represents. She attended Langstaff Secondary School in York Region, where she participated in a French-immersion program, enabling her to become fluent in French, English, and Russian. Her educational journey led her to the University of Toronto, where she earned an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree. She later pursued graduate studies at the University of Ottawa and the Rotman School of Management, further expanding her knowledge and skillset.

In addition to her political and professional endeavors, Melissa is actively involved in various organizations. She has served on the boards of the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee, the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, Jewish Addiction Community Services (JACS), and the Michael Garron Hospital in Toronto. These commitments reflect her dedication to making a positive impact on her community and the lives of others.

Melissa Lantsman's contributions to Canadian politics have not gone unnoticed. Her unwavering commitment to public service, coupled with her exceptional communication skills, has earned her respect and admiration from colleagues and constituents alike. With her appointment as co-Deputy Leader by Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre, Melissa's influence and impact continue to grow, promising a bright future for her political career and the causes she champions.

Melissa Lantsman's dedication to her role as a Member of Parliament has been evident in her actions and advocacy within the 44th Canadian Parliament. Upon being sworn in on October 26, 2021, she wasted no time in making her mark. On November 9, she was appointed by Erin O'Toole, the leader of the Conservative Party, to serve as the Shadow Minister of Transport. In this capacity, Melissa has been instrumental in scrutinizing government policies related to transportation and advocating for solutions that benefit Canadians.

One notable moment that showcased Melissa's resilience and determination occurred on February 16, 2022, during a parliamentary session. Melissa raised an important question regarding the usage of the Emergencies Act, to which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded with an inappropriate remark, accusing Conservative Party members of standing with people who wave swastikas. Melissa, a strong Jewish woman and the descendant of Holocaust survivors, stood up and demanded an apology from the Prime Minister, emphasizing that she had never felt less than she did in that moment. Although Trudeau did not respond to her request, Melissa's powerful response resonated with many and highlighted her ability to fearlessly confront adversity.

Recognizing Melissa's exceptional leadership and dedication, Candice Bergen, Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party, appointed her as the Chair of Outreach in the Conservative Party's leadership team on February 27. This additional role showcases Melissa's skills in connecting with diverse communities and expanding the party's reach across Canada.

Following the Conservative Party of Canada's leadership election in September 2022, Pierre Poilievre, the newly elected Opposition Leader, named Melissa Lantsman as one of two co-Deputy Leaders, alongside Tim Uppal, an MP from Alberta. This appointment solidifies Melissa's position as a trusted and influential figure within the party, with her expertise and insights being sought after at the highest levels of leadership.

Melissa Lantsman's journey from a communications advisor to a Member of Parliament has been marked by determination, resilience, and a commitment to public service. Her ability to effectively communicate, her dedication to her constituents, and her passion for making a positive impact on the lives of Canadians have solidified her reputation as a formidable political figure.

As Melissa continues to serve her constituents in Thornhill and contribute to the Conservative Party's efforts in the Canadian Parliament, there is no doubt that she will play a vital role in shaping the political landscape and championing the causes she holds dear. Her story serves as an inspiration to aspiring politicians and advocates for greater diversity and representation within the political sphere. With her strong leadership, unwavering values, and remarkable achievements, Melissa Lantsman is poised to leave an indelible mark on Canadian politics for years to come.
