Marie-France Lalonde MP, a prominent Franco-Ontarian politician from Canada, was born around 1971 and has made significant contributions in both provincial and federal politics. She is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada and has been serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Orléans riding since 2019. Prior to her federal career, Lalonde held the position of Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the provincial riding of Orléans from 2014 to 2019, when she decided to pursue federal politics by resigning her seat. She garnered considerable support and secured her victory in the riding with an impressive 54 percent of the vote.

In January 2017, Lalonde was appointed as the Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, followed by her appointment as the first Minister of Francophone Affairs in July 2017. She served in these roles throughout the tenure of the Kathleen Wynne government. Lalonde had previously held positions as the Minister of Government and Consumer Services and as the Minister Responsible for Francophone Affairs in Kathleen Wynne's cabinet.

Lalonde's journey began in Ottawa, Ontario, where she was born, and she grew up in Gatineau, Quebec. She pursued her education at Collège de l'Outaouais, the University of Ottawa, and the Université du Québec à Hull. Before entering politics, Lalonde worked at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario and the Ottawa Hospital. Additionally, she is a co-owner of Portobello Manor, a senior's residence. Lalonde currently resides in Orleans, Ontario, along with her husband Alvaro and their daughter, Monica Granados, who holds the position of Director of Communications at the office of the President of the Treasury Board, Mona Fortier.

Lalonde's political career gained momentum when she ran as the Liberal candidate in the 2014 provincial election for the Ottawa—Orléans riding. She emerged victorious, defeating her Progressive Conservative opponent by a substantial margin of 11,472 votes. Lalonde assumed various roles during her provincial tenure, including Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure, with a focus on economic development issues. She also served as the Parliamentary Assistant to Madeleine Meilleur, who was responsible for francophone affairs. Notably, Lalonde was appointed as Chief Government Whip on September 2, 2015, and served in this position until her appointment to the cabinet.

In June 2016, Lalonde joined the cabinet as the Minister of Government and Consumer Services and the Minister Responsible for Francophone Affairs. Subsequently, in January 2017, she transitioned to the role of Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, replacing David Orazietti. Lalonde was also designated the Minister of Francophone Affairs in July 2017. Throughout her tenure, she introduced significant legislation, such as Bill 75, which aimed to ban the production and addition of microbeads to cosmetic products in Ontario, making it the first provincial jurisdiction to address this concern. She also introduced a motion to erect a monument honoring the first two female Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) on the grounds of the Ontario Legislature, which received unanimous support from all three parties.

One of Lalonde's notable accomplishments as Minister of Government and Consumer Services was the introduction of Bill 59, known as the Putting Consumers First Act. This legislation brought about regulations for door-to-door sales, home inspectors, and further regulations for alternative financial services. In November 2017, she introduced legislation leading to a comprehensive reform of the Police Services Act, incorporating public consultation and recommendations from Justice Tulloch's report. These reforms aimed to enhance police oversight and implement significant changes to law enforcement operations within

 the province. Additionally, Lalonde introduced Bill 6, the Correctional Services Transformation Act, 2018, which sought to improve conditions, increase transparency, and apply evidence-based approaches to rehabilitation and reintegration in Ontario's adult correctional system.

Lalonde's dedication to public service extended beyond her provincial career. In May 2019, she announced her candidacy for the federal Liberal Party's nomination in the 2019 federal election, aiming to succeed the retiring MP Andrew Leslie in Orléans. After winning the nomination on September 19, she promptly resigned her provincial seat. Lalonde emerged victorious in the federal election held on October 21, securing the Orléans riding with an impressive 54 percent of the vote. On March 19, 2021, in a Cabinet Shuffle by Prime Minister Trudeau, Lalonde was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages. Currently, she serves as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, actively contributing to important initiatives in the federal government.
