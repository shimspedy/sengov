Tim Louis MP, born in 1969, is a Canadian Liberal politician and musician. He made his mark in the political arena by being elected as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the federal riding Kitchenerâ€”Conestoga, during the 2019 Canadian federal election. In a noteworthy victory, he defeated the incumbent Harold Albrecht.[3]

But Tim Louis is not just a politician; he is also a talented musician with a passion for jazz. Born in New Jersey, he discovered his love for music at a young age and began playing the piano at the tender age of five. His dedication to music led him to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree in music from Rutgers University, where he had the privilege of studying under the renowned jazz pianist Kenny Barron, graduating in 1991.[1]

Following his graduation, Tim Louis embarked on a diverse musical journey. He explored various genres and musical avenues, including playing with an Italian wedding band and joining a touring rock and roll band called Soul Engines. As a member of Soul Engines, he had the opportunity to open for bands such as Hootie and the Blowfish. The band even had a debut album produced by Teo Macero, but unfortunately, it never saw the light of day due to the folding of their independent label.[4]

In 1994, Tim Louis made a significant move to Kitchener, his future spouse's hometown, where he eventually settled down and got married on September 21, 1995. Throughout his career, he collaborated with prominent Canadian country music artists like Lace and Jamie Warren. Their collaboration on the single "Sunny Day in the Park" earned them the prestigious 2002 SOCAN Songwriter of the Year award.[5]

As a jazz artist, Tim Louis has released several albums, showcasing his remarkable talent and versatility. Some of his notable works include "Til it be Tomorrow" (2006), "Untrue" (2009), "Snowflakes in Bloom" (2010), "Snapshots" (2012), and "Bittersweet" (2019).[6][7] His dedication to jazz also led him to host a jazz radio program called "Tim's Jazz Sessions" on Centre Wellington station CICW-FM from 2012 to 2019. This program served as the inspiration for two pilot television episodes he developed.[8][9]

Despite his success in the world of music, Tim Louis felt a calling to contribute to his community in a different way. In 2015, he made his first foray into politics by running against the Conservative incumbent Harold Albrecht, who had held the seat since 2006. Although he was unsuccessful in that election, it did not deter him from pursuing his political aspirations. In the subsequent 2019 election, Tim Louis's perseverance paid off, as he managed to unseat Harold Albrecht. However, due to clerical errors in five polls, the confirmation of his victory in the electoral district was delayed by over 12 hours.[10]

Tim Louis attributes his victory in 2019 to his increased understanding of the specific needs of his riding, particularly the townships within it. He focused on addressing issues such as affordability, climate change, and healthcare, which resonated with the constituents.[11] His commitment to public service was reaffirmed when he was re-elected for a second term in 2021, further solidifying his dedication to serving the people he represents.[12]

Throughout his tenure as an MP, Tim Louis has actively participated in various parliamentary committees, including the COVID-19 Pandemic, Canadian Heritage, and Agriculture and Afri-Food committees. His contributions to these committees demonstrate his commitment to making a

 positive impact on important issues affecting the nation.

With his passion for both music and politics, Tim Louis continues to be a notable figure in Canada's cultural and political landscape, striving to make a difference in the lives of his constituents and the country as a whole.
