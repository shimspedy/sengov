Education and Early Career
Bradford's pursuit of knowledge began with a Diploma in Travel and Tourism from Humber College. She further honed her skills by obtaining a certification in Economic Development from the University of Waterloo. To enhance her managerial expertise, Bradford completed the Ontario Management Development and Supervisory Studies program at Mohawk College. This diverse educational background laid a strong foundation for her future endeavors.

Bradford initially showcased her talents as a volunteer Producer and on-air personality for TV Hamilton, Cable 14. Her passion for serving others led her to become an Imperial Service Financial Advisor and Small Business Advisor at CIBC, where she assisted numerous individuals and entrepreneurs in achieving their financial goals.

Career in Economic Development
Recognizing her knack for fostering economic growth, Bradford embarked on a career in economic development. From 2005 to 2020, she served as a Business Development Officer for the City of Kitchener, where she played a crucial role in attracting investments and promoting local businesses. In addition to her municipal role, Bradford also chaired the Workforce Planning Board of Waterloo Wellington Dufferin from 2016 to 2020, demonstrating her commitment to addressing workforce challenges and ensuring economic prosperity for her community.

Entry into Federal Politics
In the 2021 Canadian federal election, Bradford's dedication and passion for public service led her to enter the federal political arena. Building on the foundations laid by her predecessor, Marwan Tabbara, Bradford successfully campaigned and secured her position as the representative for Kitchener South—Hespeler.

Active Role in Parliament
Within the 44th Parliament, Bradford has taken on various important responsibilities. She serves as a member of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Standing Committee on Science and Research, and the Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure of the Standing Committee on Science and Research. In addition to these committee memberships, Bradford is the Director of the Canada-Africa Parliamentary Association and actively participates in numerous parliamentary associations and interparliamentary groups, further amplifying her influence and ability to enact positive change.

Policy Focus and Achievements
Bradford has been a vocal advocate for disability support, affordability, and addressing the labor crisis within her constituency. She recognizes the importance of these issues in improving the lives of her constituents and is committed to finding effective solutions.

One notable accomplishment of Bradford's tenure is her joint seconding of Bill C-224, the National Framework on Cancers Linked to Firefighting Act. This crucial legislation aims to raise awareness of the cancers linked to firefighting and enhance accessibility to prevention and treatment for firefighters. The bill is currently in its report stage, reflecting Bradford's dedication to public health and safety.

Furthermore, Bradford jointly seconded motion M-44, which focuses on granting permanent residency to temporary foreign workers. This motion aims to develop a comprehensive plan that expands the economic immigration stream, allowing workers of all skill levels to meet the criteria for permanent residency in Canada. With amendments, the motion was agreed upon in May of 2022, underscoring Bradford's commitment to inclusivity and recognizing the valuable contributions of temporary foreign workers.
