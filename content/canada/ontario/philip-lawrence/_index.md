Philip Lawrence is a prominent Canadian politician known for his role as a Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Northumberland—Peterborough South riding. Born and raised in Canada, Lawrence embarked on a political career that has spanned several years, making a significant impact on the nation's legislative landscape.

Lawrence's academic journey commenced at Brock University, where he pursued a degree in Political Science, cultivating his passion for public service and governance. Eager to broaden his expertise, he then pursued legal studies at Osgoode Hall Law School and concurrently pursued a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree at the Schulich School of Business. His determination and hard work led to the successful acquisition of a law degree and an MBA, setting the stage for his future endeavors.

After completing his education, Lawrence embarked on a legal career, specializing in taxation and corporations. He honed his legal skills and deepened his understanding of financial matters by joining one of Canada's largest financial institutions in 2008. Notably, Lawrence's entrance into the financial services industry marked the continuation of a proud family tradition, as he became the third generation of his family to contribute to this field.

Driven by a desire to make a positive impact beyond his professional pursuits, Lawrence volunteered his time and expertise at the Financial Planning Standards Council. He actively participated in the development of examination questions, showcasing his commitment to advancing the standards of the profession. Recognizing his dedication, Lawrence was eventually appointed to the disciplinary committee, where he continues to serve and uphold the integrity of the financial planning industry.

Lawrence's passion for public service led him to enter the realm of politics. In the 2019 Canadian federal election, he secured a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, proudly representing the Northumberland—Peterborough South riding. A testament to his capabilities and commitment, Lawrence was appointed as the Shadow Minister of National Revenue in the Conservative Party's shadow cabinet on September 8, 2020.

Throughout his political career, Lawrence has been an advocate for various causes and initiatives. In February 2020, he presented a private member's bill, Bill C-206, aiming to amend the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act to exempt natural gas and propane used by farmers from carbon taxes. Demonstrating his dedication to the agricultural community, Lawrence sought to alleviate the financial burden on farmers and support their sustainability efforts.

Additionally, Lawrence sponsored an e-petition in April 2021, which aimed to revise Bill-6—a proposed legislation that sought to ban conversion therapy nationwide. While his involvement stirred debate, it showcased Lawrence's commitment to open dialogue and a thorough examination of legislation that impacts the lives of Canadians.

In May 2021, Lawrence addressed concerns related to border security and the spread of COVID-19 variants in a letter to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. His firm stance highlighted the need for robust measures to protect the lives and livelihoods of Canadians.

Outside of his political commitments, Lawrence cherishes his personal life. He is the son of James and Leslie Lawrence, who instilled in him a sense of dedication and strong work ethic. James, who worked in insurance and financial services, introduced Philip to the industry during his university years. Prior to settling in Pelham, Ontario, Lawrence and his family resided in Regina, Saskatchewan, and the Durham area. In 2004, he married Natasha, an Occupational Therapist, and together they have two children, James and Margaret.

Lawrence's dedication to public service extends beyond his political role. He actively participates in the Newcastle Lions Club and serves as a Director in the Northumberland-Peterborough South Conservative Party riding association, exemplifying his commitment to community engagement and political involvement.

Philip Lawrence MP's unwavering dedication to public

 service, coupled with his extensive legal and financial background, positions him as a prominent figure within Canadian politics. His contributions continue to shape the nation's legislative landscape, fostering dialogue, and striving for positive change.
