Additionally, he holds the role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion.

Chiang's early life saw him being born in Karachi, Pakistan to Chinese parents. He spent his formative years in Pakistan until his family decided to immigrate to Canada in 1976 to reunite with his father's side of the family. It's worth noting that his grandparents had already been residing in Pakistan since 1927.

With a career spanning nearly three decades, Chiang served as a police officer in the York Regional Police. Climbing the ranks, he retired in 2020 as a Sergeant. Notably, in 2013, he took on the role of a diversity officer at the Diversity and Cultural Resources Unit, showcasing his commitment to promoting inclusivity. Prior to joining the York Regional Police in 1999, Chiang had worked with the London Police Service starting in 1992 and the Durham Regional Police.

In his personal life, Chiang is married to Monica, who shares his Chinese heritage and was born in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Together, they have three children. Chiang's linguistic abilities are diverse, as he is fluent in Hakka Chinese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hubei, and English. Additionally, he possesses fluency in Urdu, Punjabi, and has knowledge of Pashto from his early years in Pakistan.
