Arielle Kayabaga is a distinguished Canadian politician who made her mark in the political landscape by being elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the 2021 Canadian federal election. She proudly represents the electoral district of London West as a prominent member of the Liberal Party of Canada. With her dedication and commitment to public service, Kayabaga has become a leading voice for her constituents and an advocate for positive change.

Kayabaga's journey began in Bujumbura, Burundi, where she was born. However, due to the turbulent conditions brought about by the Burundian Civil War, her family sought refuge in Canada when she was just 11 years old. They initially settled in Montreal for a year before eventually finding their home in London, Ontario. Kayabaga's experiences as a refugee shaped her perspective and ignited her passion for social justice and community engagement.

To further her knowledge and understanding of political systems, Kayabaga pursued a bachelor's degree in political science from Carleton University in Ottawa, which she successfully obtained in 2013. Armed with her education and a deep sense of purpose, she embarked on a career dedicated to helping newcomers settle into their new lives in London and nearby Sarnia, Ontario. As a settlement worker, she provided invaluable support and guidance to individuals and families adjusting to a different culture and society.

In 2018, at the young age of 27, Kayabaga achieved another milestone in her career by winning a seat on the London City Council. Her election marked a historic moment, as she became the first black woman to hold such a position in the city's history. Throughout her term, Kayabaga served her constituents with distinction and passion, chairing the Corporate Services Committee and contributing to the Standing Committee on Municipal Finance. Her dedication to public service was unwavering, despite facing challenges along the way.

In September 2020, Kayabaga demonstrated her resilience and courage when she reported her office receiving harassing phone calls, prompting an investigation by the London police. Her unwavering commitment to her responsibilities as a city councillor and her determination to stand up against harassment showcased her leadership qualities and unwavering dedication to serving her community.

As the 2021 Canadian federal election approached, Kayabaga announced her intention to run for the federal House of Commons. Just three days before the start of the electoral campaign, she won the Liberal Party of Canada nomination for the riding of London West, solidifying her position as a formidable candidate. Through her tireless campaign efforts and steadfast commitment to the values of the Liberal Party, Kayabaga emerged victorious, securing the seat with an impressive 36.8% of the vote. Her election was a momentous occasion as she became the first Franco-Ontarian to serve as a Member of Parliament for London West.

Arielle Kayabaga's story is one of resilience, determination, and a deep-seated passion for public service. She continues to inspire others with her leadership, advocating for the needs of her constituents, and working towards a better and more inclusive future for all Canadians. Her journey serves as a testament to the power of perseverance and the ability to effect meaningful change in the face of adversity.
