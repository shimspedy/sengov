Mark Gerretsen MP, born on June 5, 1975, is a Canadian politician and member of the Liberal Party of Canada. He currently serves as the Member of Parliament for Kingston and the Islands. Gerretsen was first elected in the 2015 federal election and has been re-elected in 2019 and 2021. His political career has been marked by his dedication to public service and his active involvement in both municipal and federal politics.

Born in Kingston, Ontario, Gerretsen holds a bachelor's degree in economics from Queen's University and has studied computers at St. Lawrence College. His political journey began in 2006 when he was elected to Kingston City Council, representing the Portsmouth District. After completing his four-year term as a City Councillor, Gerretsen served as the Mayor of Kingston from 2010 to 2014.

During his tenure as Mayor, Gerretsen worked tirelessly to advance various issues important to the city. He collaborated with municipal leaders across Ontario on matters such as payments in lieu of taxes, the integration of social services, and increased investment in local infrastructure and affordable housing. Gerretsen also played a crucial role in the creation of the Mayor's Task Force on Development, which aimed to enhance customer service for residents, and the development of an Age-Friendly Plan focused on making Kingston more senior-friendly.

Gerretsen's dedication to public service extended beyond Kingston. In 2012, he was elected to represent the City of Kingston on the Board of Directors of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO). As a member of the Large Urban Mayor's Caucus of Ontario (LUMCO), Gerretsen collaborated with municipal leaders across the province, advocating for increased investments in local infrastructure and affordable housing.

In 2013, Gerretsen gained attention when he expressed his concerns about the rowdy behavior and costs associated with Queen's University's Homecoming street parties. His remarks during that time became a subject of memes, reflecting the public's reaction to his statement.

In the 2015 federal election, Gerretsen successfully transitioned to federal politics, replacing the retiring Liberal MP Ted Hsu. He won the election with a significant majority, securing 55.37% of the votes and defeating Conservative candidate Andy Brooke by over 21,000 votes. During his first term in the House of Commons, Gerretsen served on the Standing Committee for National Defense and was elected as Chair of the Ontario Liberal Caucus. Additionally, he was a member of the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development for two and a half years.

Throughout his initial term, Gerretsen worked diligently to secure federal funding for numerous initiatives in Kingston and the Islands. Notable investments included $1 million for Breakwater Park and Gord Downie Pier, $42 million for public transit, $31 million for new ferry vessels, and $60 million for the Third Crossing.

Gerretsen's commitment to addressing important social issues was evident through his Private Members Bill, Bill C-243, The National Maternity Assistance Program Strategy. The bill aimed to introduce amendments to the Employment Insurance Act, establishing a national maternity assistance program for pregnant women unable to work. Inspired by the experiences of a constituent in his riding, Gerretsen's bill passed second and third readings in Parliament and was brought to the Senate for consideration.

While Gerretsen supports many Liberal policies, he is not hesitant to voice his concerns when he disagrees with the government's approach. As a strong advocate for the environment, he openly opposed the expansion of the Kinder Morgan pipeline. In a notable instance, Gerretsen was one of three Liberal MPs who voted in favor of a motion proposed by the New Democratic Party to halt the project.

In the 2019

 federal election, Gerretsen was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Kingston and the Islands. He currently serves as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, while also being a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.

Outside of politics, Gerretsen enjoys a fulfilling personal life. He resides in Kingston's east end with his wife Vanessa and their three children, Mason, Francesco, and Vivian. Gerretsen comes from a family with a strong political background, as his father, John Gerretsen, served as the Mayor of Kingston and Member of Provincial Parliament for Kingston and the Islands, holding several positions in the cabinets of Premier Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne.

Throughout his career, Gerretsen has demonstrated a commitment to sustainable development and environmental initiatives. During his mayoralty, he launched Sustainable Kingston, a non-profit organization aimed at making Kingston Canada's most sustainable city. He also oversaw the conversion of all street lights in the city to LED. On a personal level, Gerretsen and his wife have been driving electric vehicles since 2012 and participated in Ontario's Microfit program, installing solar panels to contribute electricity back to the grid.

Mark Gerretsen MP continues to serve his constituents and contribute to Canadian politics with his passion for public service, dedication to sustainable development, and commitment to addressing critical issues affecting his community and the country as a whole.
