She represents the federal electoral district of Brampton South, a role she was elected to during the 2015 Canadian federal election.

Sonia Sidhu was born in India and immigrated to Canada in 1992, seeking new opportunities and a better life for herself and her family.

Her political journey began with her election as the Member of Parliament for Brampton South on October 19, 2015, as a candidate for the Liberal Party. Before entering politics, she dedicated over 18 years of her professional life to the healthcare field, working as a diabetes educator and research coordinator. Sonia's passion for public service was evident even before her political career, as she actively volunteered for political campaigns at all levels of government and served numerous organizations.

Within the Parliament, Sonia Sidhu holds key positions and responsibilities. She is a member of the House of Commons' Standing Committee on Health, where she actively contributes to discussions and initiatives concerning healthcare policies. Additionally, she was appointed as a member of the Special Committee on Pay Equity, demonstrating her commitment to advancing gender equality in Canada. Sonia also serves as the Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women and is the Chair and Liberal caucus champion for the All-Party Diabetes Caucus, emphasizing her dedication to improving diabetes awareness and support.

Furthermore, Sonia Sidhu holds prominent roles in several parliamentary friendship groups, reflecting her commitment to fostering international relations. She serves as the General-Secretary of the Canada-India Parliamentary Friendship Group and holds executive positions in both the Canada-Poland and Canada-Portugal Parliamentary Friendship Groups. She is also an active member of the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association, the Canada-U.S. Inter-Parliamentary Group, and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, contributing to collaborative efforts between Canada and other nations.

During her tenure in the 43rd Canadian Parliament, Sonia Sidhu achieved a significant milestone with the adoption of her private member bill, known as Bill C-237, which established a national framework for diabetes. This legislation required the Minister of Health to develop a framework within a year, focusing on improving access to information on diabetes prevention and treatment. The framework was subsequently tabled in the House of Commons on October 5, 2022, presenting a unified policy direction for addressing diabetes throughout the country.

In the 44th Canadian Parliament, Sonia Sidhu continued her dedication to public health and well-being by proposing a motion on active living in Canada, designated as M-82. Through this motion, she sought to promote healthier lifestyles and encourage physical activity among Canadians.

Beyond her political endeavors, Sonia Sidhu cherishes her personal life. She resides in Brampton South, her electoral district, alongside her husband, Gurjit. Together, they have been blessed with twin daughters and a son, enriching her life with love and joy.
