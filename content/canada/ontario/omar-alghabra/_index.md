Biography of Omar Alghabra

Omar Alghabra PC MP  is a Saudi-born Syrian-Canadian politician who has made significant contributions to public service in Canada. He currently serves as the Minister of Transport, a position he has held since January 2021. Alghabra is a member of the Liberal Party and represents the riding of Mississauga Centre in the House of Commons, having been elected in the 2015 election. He previously served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Mississauga—Erindale from 2006 to 2008.

Early Life and Education
Born on October 24, 1969, in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia, to a Syrian family, Alghabra's father, an architect, relocated the family to Saudi Arabia in 1968. Alghabra recalls his early years in Saudi Arabia, where he enjoyed a sheltered life, attending private school and spending summers in Syria. After completing his high school education at the Dhahran Ahliyya School in Alkhobar, he decided to pursue his engineering degree at Damascus University in Syria. However, he eventually chose to continue his education in Canada.

At the age of 19, Alghabra moved to Toronto, Ontario, to pursue his studies. He attended grade 13 to obtain his Ontario high school diploma and later earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute. Seeking further education, he attended York University, where he graduated with a Master of Business Administration.

Professional Career
Alghabra's professional career began at Ainsworth Inc., where he served as a quality assurance supervisor. He later transitioned to sales and worked as the predictive maintenance supervisor. His expertise in industrial services led him to join General Electric (GE) as a Six Sigma Black Belt, specializing in the industrial service business. At GE, he eventually became the global business leader for the company's industrial refurbished parts business.

Following his temporary exit from politics after the 2008 general election, Alghabra joined ENBALA Power Networks as the Vice President for Corporate Development. He later worked as an advisor to the Chief Operating Officer of the Ontario Energy Board, focusing on innovation in the utility sector. Alghabra also returned to the Faculty of Engineering and Architectural Science, assuming the role of a distinguished visiting professor. Additionally, he became the executive-in-residence at Ryerson's start-up incubator DMZ.

In 2004–2005, Alghabra served as the President of the Canadian Arab Federation (CAF). Although he left the organization before it made controversial statements, he publicly denounced those statements.

Political Career
Alghabra first entered political office following the 2006 federal election, becoming a Member of Parliament (MP) in the 39th Parliament of Canada. He was subsequently reelected in 2015 to the 42nd Parliament of Canada. When a fellow MP retired, Alghabra decided to run as the Liberal candidate in the 2006 federal election in the riding of Mississauga—Erindale. He emerged victorious, defeating the Conservative candidate Bob Dechert by 3,328 votes. However, his tenure was cut short as he was defeated in the 2008 election. Undeterred, he successfully ran again in 2015 and was reelected in 2019.

During his time in Parliament, Alghabra served as the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Consular Affairs) from 2015 to 2018 and the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of International Trade Diversification from 2018 to 2019. His dedication to

 public service and his constituents was evident as he advocated for their interests and addressed pressing issues.

In the 2019 federal election, Alghabra was reelected once again. He was appointed as the parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister (Public Service Renewal) and the parliamentary secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. Recognizing his contributions, Alghabra was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council in February 2020. On January 12, 2021, he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, succeeding Marc Garneau, in a Cabinet reshuffle.

Throughout his political career, Alghabra has been dedicated to tackling important matters, including advocating for the rights of Muslim Canadians and addressing issues related to consular affairs, international trade, and the tragic Ukrainian International Airlines Flight PS752.

As Minister of Transport, Alghabra continues to serve the Canadian public, overseeing the transportation portfolio and contributing to the development and implementation of transportation policies and initiatives.

Alghabra's commitment to public service, combined with his diverse professional experience, has shaped him into a prominent figure in Canadian politics, dedicated to making a positive impact in the lives of Canadians.
