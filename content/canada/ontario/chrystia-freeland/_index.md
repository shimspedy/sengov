Christina Alexandra Freeland PC MP, born on August 2, 1968, is a Canadian politician who currently serves as the tenth and current Deputy Prime Minister of Canada since 2019 and the Minister of Finance since 2020. As a member of the Liberal Party, she represents the Toronto riding of University—Rosedale in the House of Commons. Freeland made history as the first woman to hold the finance portfolio.

Freeland was born in Peace River, Alberta, and had a diverse educational background. She earned a bachelor's degree in Russian history and literature from Harvard University and a master's degree in Slavonic studies from Oxford University. Before entering politics, she built a successful career in journalism. She worked in various editorial positions at renowned publications such as the Financial Times, The Globe and Mail, and Reuters, eventually becoming the managing director of Reuters. Freeland is also an accomplished author, with notable works including "Sale of the Century" (2000) and "Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else" (2012).

Freeland entered politics in 2013 and won the nomination for the Liberal Party in Toronto Centre. She went on to win the by-election and became a member of the House of Commons. After the 2015 federal election, she was appointed to the Cabinet of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, serving as the Minister of International Trade. In this role, she played a key part in negotiating significant trade agreements such as the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union.

In 2017, Freeland was appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, replacing Stéphane Dion. During her tenure, she addressed important international issues, including the crisis in Ukraine and the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. She also advocated for human rights and criticized authoritarian regimes.

Following the 2019 federal election, Freeland took on the role of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. In these positions, she focused on strengthening Canada's domestic policies, such as healthcare, climate strategy, childcare, and interprovincial trade. She also played a vital role in Canada-US relations, including the ratification of the CUSMA trade agreement.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Freeland chaired the Cabinet committee on the federal response to the crisis. She worked closely with provincial leaders, including Ontario Premier Doug Ford, to navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic.

In 2020, Freeland was appointed as the Minister of Finance, assuming responsibility for managing Canada's economic and financial affairs. She presented her first federal budget in 2021, which introduced significant measures such as a national childcare program.

Throughout her political career, Freeland has been recognized for her influence and expertise. She has been dubbed the "Minister of Everything" by political commentators, highlighting her broad range of responsibilities and contributions. She is regarded as one of the most influential Cabinet ministers of Trudeau's premiership.

Beyond her political endeavors, Freeland's early life and activism played a formative role in shaping her worldview. From a young age, she demonstrated a passion for social justice and international affairs. Her experiences in Ukraine, where she documented Soviet-era atrocities and supported Ukrainian activists, caught the attention of the KGB and Soviet newspapers. These experiences further fueled her commitment to championing human rights and democracy.

Christina Alexandra Freeland's remarkable journey from journalism to politics has positioned her as a prominent figure in Canadian politics. Her accomplishments as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance reflect her dedication to public service and her commitment to making a positive impact on the country's economic, social, and international landscape.
