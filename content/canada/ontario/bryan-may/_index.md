Bryan J. May, born on September 19, 1974, is a Canadian politician renowned for his contributions to public service. He successfully ran in both the 2015 and 2019 Canadian federal elections, securing a position as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the electoral district of Cambridge. May's political affiliation lies with the Liberal Party, a choice that aligns with his progressive ideals and dedication to fostering positive change in his community. His political journey reflects a deep commitment to public service and the pursuit of a better future for all Canadians.

May's involvement in politics commenced during the 2011 federal election when he first ran as a candidate for the Liberal Party, finishing in third place. Undeterred by the outcome, he remained devoted to public service and was subsequently acclaimed as the Liberal Party's candidate for Cambridge in the 2015 federal election, a testament to his unwavering dedication and the trust he garnered from his constituents.

On December 3, 2021, May's exceptional abilities and commitment to serving his nation were recognized by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. May was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, Anita Anand, assuming a crucial role in shaping and implementing national defense policies.

During the 42nd Parliament of Canada, May took the floor in the House of Commons for the first time on December 11, 2015, to pay tribute to a high-profile constituent who had passed away. Since then, he has actively participated in parliamentary debates, offering his insights and expertise on a range of subjects. Notably, on January 25, 2016, May introduced his first Private Member's Bill, Bill C-240, which aimed to amend the Income Tax Act by introducing a non-refundable tax credit for individuals who undergo first aid, CPR, and AED training. Although the bill faced opposition from the Liberal government during its second reading due to concerns about fairness, effectiveness, tax code complexity, and fiscal responsibility, it was referred to the standing committee on finance. Unfortunately, the bill did not progress further.

Continuing his dedicated service, May embarked on the 43rd Parliament of Canada. During this period, he assumed pivotal roles, including serving as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs (ACVA), Chair of the Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs, and as a member of the Liaison Committee. Through these positions, he displayed an unwavering commitment to the well-being and rights of veterans, contributing to the advancement of policies and initiatives that addressed their unique needs and concerns.

In 2021, May introduced a notable private member bill, Bill C-272, An Act to Amend the Copyright Act (diagnosis, maintenance or repair). This bill sought to legalize the circumvention of digital rights management programs for the sole purpose of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of a product. It gained widespread support from all parties, advancing to the committee stage on June 2, 2021. Unfortunately, with the conclusion of the 43rd Parliament in August, the bill remained in committee and could not progress further.

Bryan J. May's political journey reflects his unwavering dedication to public service and his desire to effect positive change. Through his parliamentary contributions and advocacy, he has left a significant impact on the lives of his constituents and all Canadians. With his ongoing commitment and passion, May continues to champion causes that uphold the values and aspirations of his community, leaving an indelible mark on Canadian politics.
