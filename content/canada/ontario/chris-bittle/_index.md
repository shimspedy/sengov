He is a Canadian Liberal politician who gained prominence as the Member of Parliament representing the riding of St. Catharines in the House of Commons of Canada. His political career took off after he was elected in the 2015 federal election, securing victory over incumbent Rick Dykstra with 24,870 votes.

Bittle's dedication to public service is evident through his various roles and responsibilities within the government. He currently holds the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, where he actively contributes to shaping policies related to these critical areas. As part of his role, he serves on the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, further highlighting his commitment to fostering sustainable practices and environmental protection.

Throughout his political journey, Bittle has demonstrated remarkable leadership skills and has taken on significant roles within the government. He previously served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, where he collaborated closely with Minister Marc Garneau and Minister Omar Alghabra. Together, they focused on investing in public transit and ensuring safe travel during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Notably, Bittle achieved a notable milestone as the youngest Member of Parliament to hold the position of Deputy House Leader in the House of Commons. This role showcased his exceptional abilities to coordinate and manage government proceedings effectively.

Before embarking on his political career, Bittle pursued his education with dedication. He completed his secondary education at St. Paul Catholic Secondary School and went on to earn an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen's University. Later, he pursued a Bachelor of Laws degree at the University of Windsor, establishing a strong foundation in the field of law.

Prior to his entry into politics, Bittle gained valuable experience working at Lancaster, Brooks and Welch LLP as a civil litigator. He focused on a range of legal matters, including commercial disputes, real estate litigation, defamation, and landlord-tenant issues. Additionally, Bittle served as the Chair of Quest Community Health Centre, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to community health in St. Catharines.

Bittle's passion for education and sharing knowledge is evident through his involvement as an instructor in the Department of Continuing Education at Niagara College and as a seminar leader at Brock University.

In August 2022, Bittle faced controversy when he issued an apology to University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist for wrongly accusing him of racism during a dispute on Twitter. This incident highlights the complexities of navigating public discourse and the importance of accountability in political interactions.

Despite facing challenges, Bittle has continued to serve as a Member of Parliament, working diligently to represent the interests of the people of St. Catharines. In the 2021 Canadian federal election, he secured re-election, although with a decreased share of the vote.
