Jenna Sudds, born on February 8, 1979, is a prominent Canadian politician who has made significant contributions to public service. Currently serving as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Women, Gender Equality, and Youth, as well as the Member of Parliament for Kanata—Carleton in the House of Commons of Canada, she has proven herself to be a dynamic and dedicated leader. Affiliated with the Liberal Party, Sudds secured her position through her election in the 2021 Canadian federal election.

Before her political career, Sudds held notable positions within the public sector. Having grown up in Niagara Falls, Ontario, she pursued her education at Brock University in St. Catharines. In 2001, she relocated to the National Capital Region to complete her master's degree in economics at Carleton University. Following her studies, Sudds worked as an economist in the federal government for twelve years, honing her expertise in economic matters.

Sudds' passion for community development led her to become the inaugural President and executive director of the Kanata North Business Association. Her appointment to this role came after a rigorous selection process, which involved a hiring committee consisting of her predecessor on the City Council, Marianne Wilkinson. Additionally, from November 2017 to November 2018, Sudds served as the inaugural executive director at the CIO Strategy Council, a national technology council.

In March 2018, Sudds made the pivotal decision to enter the political arena and announced her candidacy for Ottawa City Council, specifically representing Kanata North. This marked the beginning of her public service at the municipal level. She was successfully elected to Ottawa City Council on October 22, 2018, and assumed office on December 1, 2018. During her tenure, Sudds proved to be an active and engaged representative, working tirelessly to address the needs and concerns of her constituents.

Sudds' commitment to community involvement extends beyond her political career. She has dedicated her time as a volunteer with organizations such as the Kanata Food Cupboard and the Ottawa Network for Education. In recognition of her outstanding leadership and service to those in need, Sudds received a Special Recognition Award from the Kanata Food Cupboard. Furthermore, her contributions to the field of economics and community development have been acknowledged through various accolades, including the Forty Under 40 Award presented by the Ottawa Business Journal and the Ottawa Chamber of Commerce in 2015. In 2017, Development Counsellors International recognized her as one of their Top 40 under 40 professionals working in economic development.

Transitioning from municipal politics to the federal level, Sudds emerged as a formidable candidate and was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Kanata—Carleton in the 2021 Canadian federal election. This victory marked a new chapter in her political career, enabling her to amplify her advocacy and influence on a national scale.

In the 44th Parliament, Sudds was appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to serve as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Women, Gender Equality, and Youth, a testament to her expertise and dedication. As a voting member of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, she actively contributes to discussions and decision-making processes on critical issues. Throughout her tenure, Sudds has championed women's rights, affordable housing, and worker's rights through her support, voting, and promotion of relevant legislation.

Notably, she played an instrumental role in the unanimous passing of legislation to ban the harmful practice of conversion therapy in the House of Commons. Recognizing the importance of economic reform, Sudds has also been a vocal advocate for strengthening Canada's technology sector, with a

 particular focus on semiconductor fabrication and critical mineral development.

On matters of foreign policy, Sudds has shown a commitment to upholding human rights and international justice. In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, she supported the imposition of sanctions against Russian political leaders and oligarchs. Similarly, she advocated for sanctions against Iran following the Mahsa Amini protests. In alignment with the recommendations of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, Sudds called for constructive dialogue between the Tibetan people and the government of the People's Republic of China, emphasizing the importance of enabling Tibet to exercise genuine autonomy within the framework of the Chinese constitution.

Sudds' unwavering dedication to public service has not come without challenges. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, she was among the Canadian officials who were sanctioned by the Russian Federation in response to the Canadian government's sanctions against Russian officials close to Vladimir Putin.

In addition to her political achievements, Sudds has received recognition for her contributions to her community and profession. She was honored as the Kanata North Citizen of the Year for the period of 2012-2013, and in 2016, she was bestowed with the 40 Under 40 International Economic Development Professional Award.

Jenna Sudds continues to make a lasting impact through her political career, unwavering dedication to the betterment of her community, and tireless efforts to advance important causes both domestically and internationally. Her commitment to serving the public and advocating for social progress embodies the values of an exemplary Canadian leader.
