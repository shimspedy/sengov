Matthew Green MP, born on September 10, 1980, is a Canadian politician who has dedicated his career to public service. He currently represents the riding of Hamilton Centre in the House of Commons of Canada, having been elected in both the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections.

Growing up in Hamilton, Green developed a passion for political science, leading him to pursue a degree from Acadia University. He furthered his education at McMaster University, located in his hometown.

Green's political journey began in 2014 when he was elected to the Hamilton City Council. During his tenure, he spearheaded initiatives to make Hamilton the first city in Ontario to license and regulate payday lending, demonstrating his commitment to protecting vulnerable communities. In 2018, he assumed the role of executive director at the Hamilton Centre for Civic Inclusion (HCCI), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting racial equality.

Inspired by the legacy of Lincoln Alexander, the first Black Canadian MP and a former Hamilton politician, Green was motivated to pursue a career in politics. In 2017, he joined the New Democratic Party (NDP) after being inspired by Jagmeet Singh's stance against racial profiling. Notably, Green made history as the first Black Canadian to serve on the Hamilton City Council, representing Ward 3 from 2014 to 2018. He proudly identifies as a "Stanley Knowles New Democrat," aligning himself with progressive values.

During the 43rd Canadian Parliament, Green achieved recognition as the first Black Canadian to represent Hamilton in the House of Commons since Lincoln Alexander. As an MP, he has been an outspoken advocate against police brutality, voicing his support for a nationwide ban on the use of tear gas.

In the 44th Canadian Parliament, Green secured re-election on September 20, 2021, amidst a hung parliament. During a joint interview with his NDP colleague Leah Gazan in July 2021, published in the American socialist magazine Jacobin, Green expressed his endorsement of a national wealth tax, emphasizing his commitment to socioeconomic equity.

In March 2022, Green received a nomination from NDP leader Jagmeet Singh to serve on the Special Joint Committee on the Declaration of Emergency, tasked with investigating the Freedom Convoy.

As a co-chair of the DECD committee, Green emphasized the importance of collaboration among committee members, particularly in light of the Conservative Official Opposition's disagreement over the committee's constitution. He expressed his interest in examining the actions of law enforcement, the role of "dark money" raised through crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe and GiveSendGo. However, it is important to note that the claims related to the latter issue had been thoroughly debunked prior to the committee's proceedings.

Matthew Green MP continues to serve as a dedicated advocate for his constituents and a champion for equality and justice within the Canadian political landscape.
