Peter Fonseca MP, born on October 5, 1966, is a distinguished Portuguese-born Canadian politician and former athlete. He currently serves as a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada, representing the esteemed riding of Mississauga East—Cooksville, a position he has held since his election in 2015.

Before embarking on his federal political journey, Fonseca made his mark as a provincial Liberal member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. He proudly represented Mississauga East from 2003 to 2007 and later Mississauga East—Cooksville from 2007 to 2011. During this period, he showcased his leadership abilities and was honored to serve as a cabinet minister in the government of Dalton McGuinty.

With a firm commitment to public service, Fonseca emerged victorious in the 2019 federal election, securing re-election in his safe Liberal riding of Mississauga East—Cooksville with an impressive 53% of the vote. He continued to earn the trust of his constituents in the 2021 federal election, prevailing once again with an impressive 50% of the vote. These successive wins reflect the profound faith placed in Fonseca's ability to represent his constituents effectively.

In the 44th parliament, which was formed after the 2021 federal election where the governing Liberals were re-elected with an increased minority, Fonseca was bestowed with the esteemed responsibility of chairing the influential Finance Committee. This appointment speaks volumes about his acumen and expertise in matters of finance and governance.

Background:
Born in Lisbon, Portugal, Fonseca migrated to Toronto with his family in 1968, where he was raised in the vibrant neighborhood of Little Portugal. He pursued his education at St. Michael's College School and later attended the University of Oregon, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree on an athletic scholarship. Fonseca further augmented his educational achievements by obtaining a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Windsor. Prior to his political career, he served as a senior performance management consultant for the Coach Corporation and also ran an importing and distributing company in Portugal.

In 2003, Fonseca entered a new chapter of his life by marrying his beloved wife Christine "Chris" Fonseca. Christine, an accomplished individual in her own right, was elected as a Councillor for Ward 3 in the Mississauga City Council during the 2010 municipal election. Her tireless dedication to public service has seen her re-elected in subsequent municipal elections, including those in 2014, 2018, and 2022.

Athletic Career:
Beyond his political accomplishments, Fonseca's athletic prowess is noteworthy. He achieved international recognition as a formidable athlete, competing at prestigious events such as the 1994 Commonwealth Games, where he secured an impressive fifth-place finish in the 10,000 meters. He proudly represented Canada at the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, Georgia, competing in the Men's Marathon. Fonseca's exceptional performance led him to be the top finisher among Canadians, securing a commendable 21st place overall in a grueling 42.195-kilometer (26.219 mi) race, clocking an impressive time of 2 hours, 17 minutes, and 28 seconds. His dedication and talent also shone through in other marathons, as he secured second place in both the 1994 Toronto Marathon and the 1994 Houston Marathon, as well as third place in the 1992 New York City Marathon and the 1990 Los Angeles Marathon.

Peter Fonseca's multifaceted journey encompasses remarkable achievements in athletics and politics. From his roots in Portugal to his current role as a

 respected member of the House of Commons, Fonseca continues to serve as an inspiration to many, embodying the essence of dedication, perseverance, and leadership.
