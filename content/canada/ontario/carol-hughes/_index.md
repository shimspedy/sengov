Carol R. Hughes MP was born on November 26, 1958, in Val Caron, Ontario. She is a prominent Canadian politician who has dedicated her career to public service. Since 2008, Hughes has been representing the electoral district of Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing in the House of Commons of Canada, demonstrating her commitment to her constituents. As a member of the New Democratic Party (NDP), she brings a strong and passionate voice to the political landscape.

Before entering politics, Hughes gained valuable experience as a staff representative for the Canadian Labour Congress. Her work with the labor union allowed her to advocate for workers' rights and understand the challenges they face. In 2004 and 2006, she ran as the NDP's candidate in the federal elections, albeit unsuccessfully, losing to the Liberal incumbent Brent St. Denis on both occasions.

In a surprising turn of events, Hughes initially announced that she would not run in the 2008 election. However, fate intervened during a trip home from a Canadian Labour Congress meeting when she stopped in Blind River for dinner. There, she encountered a couple she had never met before. Encouraged by their support and belief in her abilities, she had a change of heart and decided to re-enter the political arena. This decision proved to be fruitful, as she emerged victorious in the 2008 election, securing the seat for her riding. Her success continued, as she was re-elected in the 2011 election, solidifying her position as a respected representative for her constituents.

Throughout her career, Hughes has shown a commitment to supporting her fellow NDP members. In the 2012 NDP leadership election, she endorsed Niki Ashton, highlighting her ability to recognize and support strong leaders within her party. Furthermore, in the 2017 leadership election, Hughes threw her support behind Charlie Angus, demonstrating her dedication to advancing the values and principles of the NDP.

Due to her competence and dedication, Hughes has been appointed as the Assistant Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chair of Committees of the Whole for the second time. She previously held this important role in the 42nd Parliament, showcasing her ability to effectively contribute to the legislative process and ensure the smooth functioning of parliamentary proceedings.

Carol R. Hughes MP has proven herself to be a tireless advocate for her constituents and a strong supporter of the NDP. Through her political journey, she continues to make a positive impact on Canadian politics, striving to create a more inclusive and prosperous society for all.
