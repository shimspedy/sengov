Leslyn Lewis, born on December 2, 1970, is a prominent Canadian lawyer and politician, currently serving as the member of Parliament (MP) for Haldimand—Norfolk since 2021. As a dedicated member of the Conservative Party, Lewis has made significant contributions to Canadian politics. Notably, she contested the party leadership in both the 2020 and 2022 leadership elections, making history as the first visible minority woman to run for the federal Conservative Party leadership. Her socially conservative views have also garnered attention throughout her political career.

Early Life and Education:
Leslyn Lewis was born in Jamaica and immigrated to Canada at the age of five. She grew up in East York, Ontario, where she developed a deep appreciation for her new home country. Lewis pursued her education with determination, earning a Bachelor of Arts with high distinction from the University of Toronto's Trinity College. She continued her academic journey and obtained a Master of Environmental Studies from York University, specializing in business and environment from the Schulich School of Business. Furthermore, she holds a law degree and a PhD in international law from Osgoode Hall Law School, showcasing her commitment to legal expertise.

Legal Career:
Since around 2000, Leslyn Lewis has been practicing law, distinguishing herself as a respected legal professional. She is the managing partner of Lewis Law in Scarborough, where she specializes in commercial litigation and international trade practice, focusing on energy policy. Her exceptional legal skills have earned her a prominent position within the legal community. Lewis has also showcased her expertise on the television show Law Matters, where she has served as a host. In 2018, the province of Ontario appointed her to the board of the Ontario Trillium Foundation, and later she was named to the foundation's committee responsible for allocating funds for youth programs. Her outstanding professional accomplishments were recognized when she received the Harry Jerome Award for Professional Excellence by the Black Business and Professional Association in May 2019.

Political Career:
Leslyn Lewis embarked on her political career in the riding of Markham—Stouffville, where she served as the vice president and primary fundraiser of the Conservative electoral district association while supporting Paul Calandra as MP. In the 2015 federal election, Conservative leader Stephen Harper appointed her as a replacement candidate to run in the riding of Scarborough—Rouge Park only a few weeks before the vote, following the withdrawal of the previous Conservative candidate due to a scandal. Despite the challenging circumstances, Lewis proved herself as a capable and dedicated candidate, earning praise as a "high-quality substitute" according to the National Post. Although she placed second to Liberal candidate Gary Anandasangaree in the election, her strong performance established her as a rising political force.

2020 Conservative Party Leadership Candidate:
Leslyn Lewis made history as she confirmed her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada in February 2020. Her entry into the leadership race followed the resignation of Andrew Scheer as party leader in December 2019. Lewis's campaign was marked by her socially conservative platform, where she emphasized her opposition to conversion therapy while raising concerns about the proposed ban's potential impact on conversations with parents or religious leaders. Despite personally defining marriage as between a man and a woman, she pledged not to roll back existing legislation redefining marriage in Canada. Lewis positioned herself as "pro-life, no hidden agenda," advocating for a ban on sex-selective and coerced abortions, increased government funding for crisis pregnancy centers, and an end to foreign aid funding for abortions. Her candidacy received endorsements from anti-abortion advocacy groups, including the Campaign Life Coalition. Furthermore, Lewis opposed carbon taxes and advocated for promoting green technology as an alternative policy. Although she led the popular vote in

 the second ballot, she ultimately placed third in the 2020 leadership election.

2021 Federal Election and 44th Parliament:
Building on her previous political achievements, Leslyn Lewis announced her candidacy for a seat in the House of Commons in the upcoming 2021 Canadian federal election. She revealed her intention to seek the Conservative nomination in Haldimand—Norfolk, formally declaring her candidacy on September 15, 2020. The party acclaimed her as the Conservative candidate in the riding the following month. In the 2021 election, held on September 20, Lewis emerged victorious, securing the seat for the Conservative Party. Her election to Parliament marked another milestone in her political journey, further solidifying her reputation as a determined and influential figure.

Throughout her career, Lewis has been known for expressing her views with conviction and engaging in important political debates. Her stance against COVID-19 vaccine mandates for MPs and skepticism about COVID-19 vaccines for children drew attention, potentially influencing her absence from the Conservative shadow cabinet. As CBC reported, Lewis's position on vaccines seemed to be a factor: "Notably absent from the critics' list are MPs who have voiced opposition to COVID-19 vaccine policies."

2022 Conservative Party Leadership Candidate:
Undeterred by previous electoral outcomes, Leslyn Lewis announced her decision to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party once again on March 8, 2022. Her campaign echoed her previous agenda, championing socially conservative causes such as a ban on sex-selective and coerced abortions, increased funding for crisis pregnancy centers, and an end to overseas funding for abortions. On September 10, 2022, Lewis contested the leadership election but lost to Pierre Poilievre, the Member of Parliament for Carleton, receiving 9.69% of the vote on the first ballot.

Infrastructure Critic:
Following the leadership election, Lewis's expertise and knowledge led to her appointment as the infrastructure critic in Pierre Poilievre's shadow cabinet in October 2022. In this role, she continues to contribute her insights and advocate for effective infrastructure policies.

Israel Allies Caucus:
In November 2022, Leslyn Lewis made another significant impact on Canadian politics by relaunching the Canadian Israel Allies Caucus. She currently serves as the chair of the caucus, which is a member of the Israel Allies Foundation. Through this platform, Lewis actively promotes the interests and relationship between Canada and Israel.

Meeting with German Politician in 2023:
In February 2023, Leslyn Lewis, along with fellow Conservative MPs Colin Carrie and Dean Allison, had dinner with Christine Anderson, a Member of the European Parliament representing Alternative for Germany (AfD). Anderson's visit to Canada, particularly her connection with right-wing media and convoy protest supporters, raised concerns due to AfD's Islamophobic and antisemitic positions. The meeting drew condemnation from various groups, including the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre denounced Anderson's views as "vile" and racist, stating that it would have been better if she had never visited Canada. In response, Lewis and the other MPs released a joint statement, expressing their unawareness of Anderson's or her party's views and condemning racist and hateful ideologies. However, Anderson refuted Pierre Poilievre's claim, asserting that the Conservative MPs had prior knowledge of her politics before the meeting. Lewis vehemently defended herself against the criticism in an article published in the Toronto Sun.

Leslyn Lewis continues to shape Canadian politics through her dedication, strong values, and unwavering determination. As a trailblazer in her field, she has overcome numerous challenges and has demonstrated her commitment to advancing conservative principles and advocating for the causes she believes in. With her

 ongoing presence in Parliament and her significant contributions to public discourse, Lewis remains a notable figure in Canadian politics.
