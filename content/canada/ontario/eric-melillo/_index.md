Eric Melillo, born on March 27, 1998, is a passionate Canadian politician who has made a significant impact in the realm of politics. He emerged victorious in the 2019 Canadian federal election, securing a seat to represent the esteemed riding of Kenora in the House of Commons of Canada.[2] Notably, Melillo's election marked a historic milestone as he became the youngest Conservative Member of Parliament ever elected in Canada. His youthfulness also made him the youngest member in both the 43rd and 44th parliaments.[3]

Melillo's journey towards public service began to take shape during his high school years at Beaver Brae Secondary School, where he exhibited a keen interest in politics.[4] Continuing his pursuit of knowledge and personal growth, he pursued a degree in economics at Lakehead University. During this time, Melillo honed his skills by engaging in policy analysis for a non-partisan think tank in Thunder Bay, the Northern Policy Institute. Additionally, he gained valuable experience as an Associate for a Business Consulting firm and served as the campaign manager for Kenoraâ€”Rainy River MPP Greg Rickford.[5]

Upon entering the political arena, Melillo quickly demonstrated his capabilities and dedication to his constituents. In December 2019, he was appointed as the Conservative Party's Deputy Shadow Minister for Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, as well as the Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario.[6] His remarkable efforts did not go unnoticed, as he was later selected by Erin O'Toole to join the Shadow Cabinet as the Shadow Minister for Northern Affairs and Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario in the second session of the 43rd Parliament.[7] Throughout his tenure in the 43rd Parliament, Melillo contributed his expertise to the Natural Resources and the Indigenous and Northern Affairs standing committees.[8]

Melillo's commitment to his constituents was evident in his first term, during which he became known for his unwavering dedication to constituency work, leading to his growing popularity among the local population.[9] Such recognition propelled him to secure re-election in the 2021 Canadian federal election.[10]

Continuing his steadfast service, Melillo maintained his position in the Conservative Shadow Cabinet in the 44th Parliament. Additionally, he assumed membership in the Natural Resources Committee, where he could leverage his knowledge and passion for this crucial field.[11]

While his political endeavors have shaped his public image, Eric Melillo also has a personal life that enriches his experiences. On June 3, 2022, he married Danaka Howden, whose brothers Quinton and Brett Howden are esteemed professional ice hockey players.
