Kamalpreet Khera PC MP, born on February 4, 1989, is a Canadian politician and registered nurse. She currently serves as the Minister of Seniors, a position she has held since October 26, 2021. Khera is a member of the Liberal Party and represents the riding of Brampton West in the House of Commons, a role she has held since the 2015 federal election.

Kamal Khera completed her education at York University, where she earned an Honours Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Prior to entering politics, she worked as a registered nurse in the oncology unit at St. Joseph's Health Centre Toronto, demonstrating her commitment to healthcare.

In December 2014, Khera was nominated as the Liberal Party's candidate for Brampton West, and in the subsequent federal election held in October 2015, she emerged victorious, securing the seat in the House of Commons. At the time of her election, Khera was the youngest Liberal MP in the House and the second-youngest overall, behind the NDP's Pierre-Luc Dusseault. She was re-elected in both the 2019 federal election and the 2021 election, demonstrating her continued support from the constituents of Brampton West.

Khera's contributions extend beyond her role as a Member of Parliament. On December 2, 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed her as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health. She later served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue from January 2017 to August 2018. From August 2018 to January 2021, Khera held the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development.

However, in January 2021, Khera stepped down from her role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development due to controversy surrounding her travel to Seattle for a memorial service for her uncle during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the border between the United States and Canada being closed to nonessential travel at the time.

Undeterred by this setback, Khera successfully re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Brampton West on September 20, 2021. Just over a month later, on October 26, 2021, she was appointed as the Minister of Seniors in Justin Trudeau's cabinet, taking over from Deb Schulte, the outgoing Minister of Seniors who had lost re-election in the riding of King-Vaughan. Notably, Khera's appointment to the cabinet and the Privy Council of Canada reflects her status as one of the youngest members in these esteemed positions.

Kamalpreet Khera's career trajectory showcases her dedication to public service and her commitment to representing her constituents. As a nurse turned politician, she brings valuable expertise and a strong voice to issues concerning healthcare and the well-being of seniors in Canada.
