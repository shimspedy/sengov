Marco Mendicino PC MP, born on July 28, 1973, is a Canadian politician who currently serves as the Minister of Public Safety since October 26, 2021. As a member of the Liberal Party, Mendicino represents Eglinton—Lawrence in the House of Commons, where he has been a Member of Parliament (MP) since 2015. Prior to his current role, he served as the Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship from 2019 to 2021.

Early Life:
Marco Mendicino was born to Italian immigrant parents. He pursued his education in political science at Carleton University before attending law school at the University of Windsor. In addition to his legal studies, he also obtained a degree in human resources management from York University's Schulich School of Business.

Professional Career:
Mendicino's career began as a federal prosecutor, where he worked for ten years, specializing in criminal law. During this time, he played a significant role in the handling of the Toronto 18 terrorism case, showcasing his expertise in the field.

Throughout his career, Mendicino has held various important positions. He worked for the Law Society of Upper Canada and served as the president of the Association of Justice Counsel. Additionally, he worked as an adjunct professor at Osgoode Hall Law School, sharing his knowledge and experience with future legal professionals.

Political Journey:
Mendicino's political involvement started as an occasional member of the Eglinton—Lawrence Liberal riding executive. In 2014, he served as legal counsel to provincial Liberal candidate Mike Colle's campaign.

In the 2015 general election, Mendicino sought the federal nomination for Eglinton—Lawrence. He faced a tough battle for the nomination following Conservative MP Eve Adams' decision to join the Liberal Party. With the support of party leader Justin Trudeau, Mendicino secured the Liberal nomination and defeated Adams in the nomination meeting.

During the election, Mendicino faced incumbent Conservative MP Joe Oliver, who held the position of Minister of Finance, and former Saskatchewan finance minister Andrew Thomson, the surprise New Democratic Party nominee. Mendicino emerged victorious, securing the seat.

In subsequent years, Mendicino held various roles within the government. He was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada in January 2017, serving under Jody Wilson-Raybould. Later, in August 2018, he became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities under François-Philippe Champagne.

Mendicino's political career continued to thrive, and he was re-elected in the 2019 federal election. He was then appointed as the Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship, where he played a key role in shaping Canada's immigration policies.

In the 2021 federal election, Mendicino was re-elected once again. On October 26, he assumed the role of Minister of Public Safety, overseeing matters related to public safety and security in Canada.

Notable Achievements and Challenges:
As Minister of Public Safety, Mendicino faced a significant challenge in dealing with the 2022 Freedom Convoy protests. In response, he oversaw the first-ever invocation of the Emergencies Act, a decision that sparked scrutiny from the media and opposition parties. Mendicino defended the government's actions by citing advice from non-partisan professional law enforcement officials, who deemed existing authorities ineffective in restoring public safety.

Amidst allegations of Chinese interference in Canadian federal elections, Mendicino acknowledged the presence of foreign interference and emphasized the need for vigilance. He announced the Liberal Government's intention to initiate consultations on a foreign influence registry to combat Chinese interference.

Throughout his political journey, Mendicino has showcased his dedication to public

 service and his commitment to addressing key issues facing Canada. With his legal background and extensive experience in government, Mendicino continues to make significant contributions to Canadian politics and the well-being of his constituents in Eglinton—Lawrence.
