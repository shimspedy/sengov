Dan Muys, born on December 25, 1970, is a Canadian politician and public relations consultant known for his dedicated service to the people of Canada. He currently holds the esteemed position of Member of Parliament for Flamborough-Glanbrook in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the Conservative Party.

Muys's journey in politics began long before his election in the 2021 Canadian federal election. He dedicated many years of his life working diligently behind the scenes, contributing to the success of various political endeavors. From 2008 to 2020, he served as the Chief of Staff for his predecessor, former MP David Sweet, showcasing his exceptional organizational and leadership skills. Throughout his career, he has held prominent roles in influential offices such as the provincial Minister's Office for Economic Development, Job Creation & Trade and the office of Michael Wilson, a federal trade minister during Brian Mulroney's era. Furthermore, he has also assumed the role of Ontario PC Party Regional Vice President for South Central Ontario, displaying his commitment to political engagement on multiple levels.

Before immersing himself in the world of politics, Muys thrived in the private sector for two decades as a highly accomplished public relations and communications consultant. His expertise primarily encompassed the fields of agriculture, agri-food, and energy, where he contributed to significant projects with industry giants like Cargill and TransCanada (now TC Energy). Muys's exceptional work in managing a Cargill campaign resulted in the prestigious CAMA award for public relations in 2004, solidifying his reputation as a skilled professional in his field.

Beyond his professional achievements, Muys actively engages with his local community and demonstrates a profound commitment to public service. He serves as a board member for both the Royal Botanical Gardens and the Canadian Public Relations Society, showcasing his dedication to fostering growth and development in these areas. Additionally, he is a proud member of the Ancaster Rotary Club, where he actively participates in community initiatives and promotes social welfare.

In recognition of his outstanding contributions and unwavering dedication, Muys was acclaimed as the federal Conservative candidate for Flamborough-Glanbrook in 2021, following the retirement of David Sweet. Currently, he serves as the Associate Shadow Minister for Transport, a position that allows him to utilize his expertise to shape policies and decisions pertaining to transportation matters. Previously, he served as the Deputy Shadow Minister for Infrastructure and Communities, further highlighting his broad understanding of critical issues.

Muys, a devoted family man, is happily married and resides in Lynden, Ontario. His personal and professional achievements reflect his passion for serving the Canadian people and his commitment to making a positive difference in their lives.
