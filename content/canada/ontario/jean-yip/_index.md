Jean Lee Yip, born in 1968 in Scarborough, Ontario, is a distinguished Chinese Canadian politician who has made significant contributions to public service. Her journey in politics began when she was elected to the House of Commons in a by-election on December 11, 2017, marking a pivotal moment in her career. As a dedicated member of the Liberal Party of Canada caucus, Yip proudly represents the electoral district of Scarboroughâ€”Agincourt, passionately advocating for the interests and concerns of her constituents.

Yip's involvement in politics was motivated not only by her personal ambition but also by a profound sense of duty and love. She is the widow of her predecessor, Arnold Chan, a well-respected politician, whose legacy continues to inspire her. Yip's unwavering support for her late husband during his battle with cancer allowed her to become a familiar face in the riding. Her compassion and commitment to assisting Chan with his constituency political duties during his challenging health journey earned her recognition and respect within the community.

Today, Jean Lee Yip stands as a prominent figure in Canadian politics, dedicated to making a positive impact in the lives of those she represents. With her profound understanding of the issues faced by her constituents and her unwavering determination to effect change, Yip strives to be a voice for the people and a catalyst for progress. Her relentless pursuit of justice, equality, and inclusivity embodies the core values she holds dear, making her an invaluable asset to both her party and the constituents she serves.
