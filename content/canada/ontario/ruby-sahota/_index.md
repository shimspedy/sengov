Ruby Sahota is a Canadian Liberal politician who has served as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the federal riding of Brampton North since the 2015 Canadian federal election.

Early Life and Education:
Ruby Sahota was born on June 22 in Toronto, Canada. Her parents immigrated to Canada in the late 1970s, and she was raised in Brampton. Her father, who was previously the Chairman of the Ontario Sikhs and Gurdwara Council, instilled in her a sense of community and public service.

Sahota attended Brampton's Central Peel Secondary School from 1993 to 1998. She then pursued her higher education at McMaster University, where she earned an Honours bachelor's degree in Political Science and Peace Studies in 2003. Her passion for law led her to enroll at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School, from which she graduated in 2007.

Legal Career:
Following her graduation from law school, Sahota embarked on a legal career. From 2007 to 2012, she practiced law in Cleveland, Ohio, specializing in commercial litigation. Her dedication and expertise earned her recognition as a competent lawyer.

Political Career:
Driven by a desire to make a difference in her community, Sahota entered the political arena. In 2015, she sought the Liberal nomination for the newly created riding of Brampton North and emerged victorious on March 1 of the same year. This marked the beginning of her political journey.

During the general election campaign, Sahota faced a controversial situation when leaflets circulated by her opponent, Conservative incumbent Parm Gill, aimed to confuse her with previous Liberal Party MP Ruby Dhalla. Despite this challenge, Sahota persevered and emerged victorious, defeating Gill in the election.

Upon her election, Sahota was appointed to the Standing Committee on the Status of Women and the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. She later joined the Special Committee on Electoral Reform, demonstrating her commitment to promoting fairness and equality in the electoral process.

On February 1, 2017, Sahota was elected as the Chair of the Federal Liberal Ontario Caucus by her peers. In her role as Caucus Chair, she plays a crucial role in presiding over meetings, leading discussions, and serving as a vital link between Ontario Liberal MPs, the Prime Minister's Office, and the Cabinet.

Personal Life:
Outside of her political career, Ruby Sahota is a devoted family woman. She is married to Dr. Tejinder Sahota, a podiatrist, and together they have a son named Nihal. Her personal life serves as a source of inspiration and support as she carries out her responsibilities as a Member of Parliament.

With her legal background and passion for social issues, she continues to work diligently to represent the interests of her constituents and contribute to the betterment of Canada as a whole.
