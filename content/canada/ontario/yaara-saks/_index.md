Ya'ara Saks MP, born on March 9, 1973, is a prominent Canadian politician known for her contributions to the House of Commons of Canada. She gained national attention when she won a by-election on October 26, 2020, following the resignation of Michael Levitt, thus becoming a Member of Parliament. Representing the riding of York Centre, Saks proudly serves as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Early Life and Background

Born in Toronto, Ya'ara Saks holds dual citizenship in Canada and Israel. Her Israeli father influenced her upbringing, and she has had the privilege of experiencing life in both countries. Saks spent a significant period living in Israel from 1995 to 2006. For her undergraduate education, she attended McGill University, and later pursued a Master's degree in international relations and diplomacy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Prior to her political career, Saks established herself as a yoga studio owner in York Centre, a neighborhood located in the northern part of Toronto. Additionally, she served as the director of Trauma Practice for Healthy Communities, a charitable organization focused on mental health.

Views on Israeli Politics

Saks has garnered attention for her outspoken criticisms of the direction taken by the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She has expressed deep concerns regarding the treatment of Israeli Arab citizens and the enactment of the 2018 Nation-State law, which she believes contributes to racism and disregards Israel's role as a haven for asylum seekers fleeing conflict. Despite her disagreements with the Likud government, Saks firmly identifies as an unapologetic Zionist who ardently supports the State of Israel. Furthermore, she condemns the BDS Movement (boycott, divestment, and sanctions against Israel), denouncing it as antisemitic.

Canadian Federal Politics

In the highly significant 2020 York Centre federal by-election, Ya'ara Saks emerged victorious as a representative of the Liberal Party of Canada. Her election to the House of Commons, alongside fellow rookie parliamentarian Marci Ien, marked a historic milestone for gender representation in Canadian politics. With their swearing-in, the number of female MPs in Canada reached 100, constituting the highest proportion of women in the chamber throughout its history, at an impressive 30%.

Notable Contributions

During her tenure in the House, Saks has made notable contributions to Canadian federal politics. In February 2022, while addressing the need for confirming the Emergencies Act in response to the "Freedom Convoy" protest, she drew attention by stating that the phrase "honk honk" (used by convoy supporters in reference to truck horns) was, in fact, an acronym for "heil Hitler." Saks substantiated her claim on Twitter by referencing antifascist researcher and organizer Gwen Snyder, who had exposed a 4chan post promoting this claim as a prank. This incident echoes previous instances where online hoaxes, like the "OK" hand gesture representing "white power," were spread on similar platforms.

Ya'ara Saks MP continues to be an influential figure in Canadian politics, championing various causes while actively representing the interests of the people she serves. Her dedication and commitment to public service exemplify her ongoing efforts to create a more inclusive and equitable society.
