Michael Kram, born on December 20, 1978, is a Canadian politician and member of the Conservative Party. He gained recognition as the representative for the riding of Regina—Wascana in the House of Commons of Canada after his election in the 2019 Canadian federal election.

Early Life and Education

Kram spent his formative years in south Regina, Saskatchewan, where he still resides. His parents, both retired teachers, instilled in him a strong work ethic and values rooted in education. Raised in a family with a farming background, he learned the importance of hard work and perseverance from his grandparents. Kram completed his secondary education at Dr. Martin LeBoldus High School in Regina.

Driven by a passion for knowledge, Kram pursued higher education at the University of Regina. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in computer science and a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in economics. Additionally, he expanded his academic horizons by studying economics at Carleton University in Ottawa.

From an early age, Kram harbored a deep-rooted aspiration to serve as a Member of Parliament, a dream that had been nurtured since his elementary school days.

Early Career

Before embarking on his political journey, Kram honed his skills and expertise in the information technology sector. He amassed valuable experience over a span of 20 years, including various contract positions with the Department of National Defence. Notably, Kram spent over 17 years as a programmer/analyst with Paradigm Consulting, an esteemed IT consulting firm based in Regina. During his tenure, he developed innovative software solutions for a diverse range of clients, including private sector organizations as well as federal and provincial entities.

Parallel to his IT career, Kram explored his passion for acting by taking on extra and bit-part roles in numerous Canadian movies and TV shows. Some notable productions he participated in include "Corner Gas: The Movie," "Edge of War," "A Dog Named Christmas," and the docu-drama series "Crime Stories," where he played the role of Detective Dominick Spinelli.

Political Career

2015 Federal Election

Kram's political aspirations led him to run as the Conservative Party of Canada candidate for the Regina—Wascana constituency in the 2015 Canadian federal election. Despite a dedicated campaign effort, he faced defeat against the long-standing Liberal MP Ralph Goodale. Nevertheless, Kram's strong showing in terms of absolute votes, comparable to previous Conservative candidates, indicated his growing support. The decline in votes for the NDP and Green parties further suggested that strategic voting may have influenced the results in favor of the Liberal campaign.

2019 Federal Election

Undeterred by his previous electoral loss, Kram embarked on a second attempt to represent Regina—Wascana in the 2019 federal election, once again as the Conservative candidate. His campaign gained momentum as he successfully secured a victory over the incumbent Ralph Goodale, winning by a margin of over 7,000 votes and capturing 49.3% of the popular vote. This surprising outcome challenged predictions that favored Goodale due to his extensive incumbency and name recognition.

As a newly elected Member of Parliament, Kram was sworn in on November 12, 2019. Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, who represents the neighboring Regina—Qu'Appelle constituency, appointed him to the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on International Trade and named him Deputy Critic for International Trade in the Conservative Opposition caucus.

In September 2020, following a leadership change within the Conservative Party, Kram was reassigned by Erin O'Toole, the new party leader, to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure, and Communities. This transition marked a new phase in his parliamentary career, during which he became an advocate for pandemic assistance for airports, particularly emphasizing the needs of his local airport in Regina, Saskatchewan.

Recognizing Kram's abilities and dedication, O'Toole appointed him Vice-Chair of the Industry and Technology Committee in December 2021. In this role, Kram actively supported various research projects at the University of Regina, including the Canadian Institute of Public Safety Research and Treatment.

Following the Conservative Party's leadership race in 2022, the newly elected leader, Pierre Poilievre, reassigned Kram to the Public Accounts committee. In his early tenure on this committee, Kram played a crucial role in uncovering instances of fraud within several federal government departments, where employees had claimed the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit while still working full-time.

2021 Federal Election

Kram sought re-election as the Conservative candidate for Regina—Wascana in the 2021 federal election. His primary opponent was Liberal candidate Sean McEachern, former chief of staff and campaign manager to former MP Ralph Goodale. McEachern frequently emphasized his connection to Goodale in the media, attempting to evoke nostalgia among voters.

Local media outlets remained skeptical about Kram's chances of re-election, identifying Regina—Wascana as a closely contested riding to watch during the campaign. The polling aggregator site 338Canada.com projected the constituency as a "toss-up" throughout much of the election season.

Despite the challenges and intense competition, Kram emerged victorious, securing nearly double the number of votes compared to his Liberal opponent. Furthermore, he managed to increase his share of the popular vote, even with the significant rise in support for the right-wing competitor, the People's Party.

Michael Kram's journey in Canadian politics exemplifies resilience, determination, and a commitment to public service. As he continues to represent Regina—Wascana in the House of Commons, his efforts focus on advocating for his constituents and addressing crucial issues such as international trade, transportation, infrastructure, and accountability within the government.
