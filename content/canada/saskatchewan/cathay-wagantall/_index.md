Cathay Wagantall MP (formerly known as Cathy Caswell) is a prominent Canadian politician who has made significant contributions to public service. Born on March 7, 1956, in Regina, Saskatchewan, she grew up in southern Saskatchewan before relocating with her parents and six siblings to Esterhazy in 1967.

Wagantall embarked on her educational journey with great determination and was awarded a full scholarship to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education at the University of Saskatchewan. She achieved top honors during her studies and spent her summers working in hospitals and level 4 care homes, gaining valuable practical experience.

After her studies, Wagantall embarked on a journey of exploration, traveling the world for a few years. Upon her return, she and her husband ventured into a business partnership in a lumberyard and contracting enterprise in Springside. Through hard work and dedication, they eventually acquired sole ownership of the business, but unfortunately, they lost it during the economic downturn of the early 1980s.

In 1985, Wagantall relocated to Edmonton, Alberta. She took on the role of athletic director at what was then North American Baptist College, later known as Taylor College and Seminary. During this time, she honed her leadership skills and made a positive impact on the academic and athletic pursuits of the students under her guidance.

In 1991, Wagantall's family moved to Lloydminster, Alberta, where her husband served as a pastor at NewLife Community Church for seven years. During this period, she actively contributed to the community by coaching basketball at various levels and working as a teacher's assistant for special needs children in both kindergarten and high school.

Returning to Edmonton in 1998, Wagantall embarked on a ten-year professional journey at Taylor University College and Seminary. Her roles included working in development, accounting, and student loans. Additionally, she dedicated her time to teaching Sunday School, nurturing the spiritual growth of young individuals.

In 2004, Wagantall began her involvement in the Conservative Party of Canada, serving on the Board of Directors for Edmonton-Mill Woods-Beaumont. She took on various responsibilities, including election readiness chair, president, and financial agent. She actively campaigned for several candidates, supporting them in their respective electoral campaigns.

In November 2014, Wagantall secured the Conservative Party nomination in Yorkton—Melville for the upcoming 2015 federal election. On October 19, 2015, she emerged victorious, winning the seat with an impressive 59.2% of the vote. As a Member of Parliament, she represented the federal electoral riding of Yorkton—Melville in the House of Commons of Canada.

During her tenure in the 42nd Parliament, Wagantall introduced a private member bill titled Bill C-225, also known as the Protection of Pregnant Women and Their Preborn Children Act (Cassie and Molly's Law). The bill aimed to recognize a "preborn child" as a separate entity in the Criminal Code, making it a distinct offense to cause harm or death to a preborn child while committing or attempting to commit another offense against a pregnant woman. Despite the bill's resemblance to Ken Epp's Unborn Victims of Crime Act, Bill C-485, Wagantall's Bill C-225 was defeated in a vote in October 2016, with only members of the Conservative Party voting in favor.

Wagantall's commitment to public service was evident in her re-election during the 2019 and 2021 federal elections. In the 43rd Canadian Parliament, she introduced another private member bill, Bill C-233, which sought to amend the Criminal Code to criminalize sex-selective abortions. Although the bill received support from Conservative Party members, it was ultimately defeated.

Outside of her political career, Wagantall has been a dedicated wife to her husband, H. Martin Wagantall, since their marriage in 1976. They have raised three children and are proud grandparents to nine grandchildren. Wagantall's Christian faith has played a significant role in her life and has influenced her values and decision-making.

Throughout her career, Cathay Wagantall MP has displayed a passion for serving her community and advocating for important causes. Her contributions to Canadian politics and her unwavering commitment to her constituents have made her a respected figure in the House of Commons.
