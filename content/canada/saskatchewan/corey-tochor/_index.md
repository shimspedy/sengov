Corey James Tochor MP, born in either 1976 or 1977, is a Canadian politician known for his dedicated service as the Member of Parliament for Saskatoon—University since the 2019 federal election.

Tochor's political career began with his election to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in the 2011 election, representing the constituency of Saskatoon Eastview as a member of the Saskatchewan Party caucus. Demonstrating his strong support, he was re-elected in the 2016 general election held on April 4, 2016. Notably, on May 17, 2016, Tochor achieved a significant milestone by being elected the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, defeating the previous Speaker, Dan D'Autremont. His tenure as Speaker lasted until January 5, 2018, when he chose to resign from the esteemed position.

March 10, 2018 marked a pivotal moment in Tochor's political journey when he secured victory in defeating incumbent MP Brad Trost for the Conservative nomination in Saskatoon—University. Taking a courageous step, Tochor resigned from his provincial seat on September 11, 2019, the same day the Writs of election were issued for the 2019 Canadian federal election. By effectively navigating the campaign trail, he emerged as the triumphant representative of the Conservatives, successfully capturing the seat.

In the realm of politics, Tochor has taken firm positions on various issues, capturing the attention of both supporters and critics. Regarding abortion, he voted in favor of Bill C-233 – An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sex-selective abortion), advocating for the criminalization of medical practitioners who knowingly perform abortions based solely on the child's genetic sex. This stance has led the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada to categorize him as anti-abortion, highlighting the ongoing debate surrounding reproductive rights.

Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, Tochor was among the 63 MPs who voted against Bill C-6, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (conversion therapy). Despite his opposition, the bill ultimately passed by majority vote, resulting in certain aspects of conversion therapy being criminalized, specifically "causing a child to undergo conversion therapy." This vote ignited further discussions and debates regarding the rights and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals.

Corey James Tochor continues to serve as a Member of Parliament, diligently representing the constituents of Saskatoon—University and engaging in the ongoing political discourse that shapes Canada's future. His career is marked by his commitment to public service and his willingness to take a stand on challenging issues, regardless of the diverse perspectives they evoke.
