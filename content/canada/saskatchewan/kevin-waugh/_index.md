Kevin Waugh MP, born on June 9, 1956, is a Canadian politician and former television sports journalist. He is known for his significant contributions in both the broadcasting industry and the political arena. Waugh began his career as a sportscaster with CTV Saskatoon, where he established himself as a well-respected and knowledgeable journalist in the field.

In 2006, Waugh embarked on his political journey by serving as the Ward 9 Trustee for the Saskatoon Public School Division, a role he fulfilled with dedication and commitment until 2015. His passion for public service and desire to make a positive impact on his community led him to seek higher office.

In the 2015 Canadian federal election, Waugh successfully secured a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Saskatoon—Grasswood. His victory marked the beginning of his career as a Member of Parliament. During his time in the 43rd Canadian Parliament, Waugh introduced a private member bill named "An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sports betting)." This bill aimed to legalize betting on single sport events in Canada, and it was adopted, showcasing his ability to effect legislative change.

Throughout his political career, Waugh has held various positions and responsibilities. He served as the Deputy Critic for Canadian Heritage after the appointment of Rona Ambrose as interim leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. Additionally, he was appointed to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, where he actively contributed to discussions and decision-making processes.

Waugh's commitment to improving education led him to introduce Bill C-241: "An Act to amend the Excise Tax Act (school authorities)" in 2016. This bill sought to increase the goods and services tax rebate received by schools and school boards, effectively exempting them from paying the tax. Despite garnering support from members of his own party, as well as the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Québécois, the bill was ultimately defeated by the Liberal majority.

With the election of Andrew Scheer as the leader of the Conservative Party in May 2017, Waugh assumed the role of Deputy Shadow Minister for Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, Indigenous Services, and the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency. In this capacity, he served on the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, further demonstrating his commitment to addressing important issues affecting Indigenous communities.

In the 2019 Canadian Federal Election, Waugh was re-elected with an increased vote count and share. This victory solidified his position as a trusted representative of his constituents. He was also elected as the Chair of the Conservative Party's Saskatchewan Regional Caucus, a role that required him to preside over meetings and communicate the outcomes to party leadership.

Waugh's dedication to promoting fair and responsible sports betting continued during his tenure in the 43rd Canadian Parliament. His private member bill, "An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sports betting)" (Bill C-218), was successfully adopted. This legislation allowed a province's lottery corporation to offer betting on single sport events, athletic contests, races, and fights, providing Canadians with new opportunities for entertainment and economic growth.

While Waugh's political career has been marked by notable achievements, he has not been without controversy. In July 2021, he voted against a bill to ban LGBT conversion therapy, aligning himself with 62 other Conservative MPs who opposed the legislation.

Beyond his professional accomplishments, Waugh is a family man who resides in Saskatoon with his wife Ann. Together, they have raised two children and are proud grandparents to a granddaughter. In addition to his public service, Waugh remains engaged with his community and recognizes individuals who make significant contributions. He honored retired police officer Bruce Gordon with the Saskatoon-Grasswood

 Canada 150 Award, acknowledging Gordon's dedication to the athletic community and numerous local organizations.

However, it is important to note that Waugh has faced criticism for his actions. On February 2, 2022, he posted a picture on his Twitter page alongside former Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer and several other politicians. The photo was taken at the Freedom Convoy 2022, which prompted the mayor of Ottawa, Jim Watson, to demand an apology from Waugh and his colleagues, expressing his disapproval of their association with the protest.

Kevin Waugh's journey from a distinguished sports journalist to a respected Member of Parliament is a testament to his dedication to public service and his desire to effect positive change. His contributions in both the broadcasting industry and politics have left an indelible mark on the Canadian landscape, and he continues to serve as a representative of his constituents with passion and integrity.
