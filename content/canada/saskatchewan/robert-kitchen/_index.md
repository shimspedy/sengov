Robert Gordon Kitchen MP, a prominent Canadian politician, was born in 1957. He is a member of the Conservative Party and currently serves as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada. His constituents in the federal electoral district of Souris—Moose Mountain elected him during the 2015 Canadian federal election.

Kitchen's early life was shaped by his father's career in the Canadian Armed Forces, which led to his birth in England. At the age of sixteen, he encountered a life-altering incident when a drunk driver struck him while he was riding his bicycle. Consequently, he lost his hearing in his left ear. Growing up, Kitchen had the opportunity to live in various countries, including Canada, England, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, and the United States.

For his education, Kitchen attended the University of Waterloo, where he pursued a Bachelor of Science (Honors) degree in Kinesiology. He furthered his academic journey by enrolling at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, where he obtained his Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree. Kitchen's dedication to expanding his expertise in chiropractic clinical sciences led him to complete a two-year specialty fellowship. During this fellowship, he underwent a six-month residency at the Royal University Hospital Department of Orthopedics in Saskatoon. Additionally, he pursued a postgraduate degree in educational administration at the University of Regina.

Over the past 26 years, Kitchen has been actively involved in the chiropractic field. He owned and operated a private chiropractic clinic in Estevan, contributing to the health and well-being of numerous individuals. Recognized for his expertise, Kitchen served as a board member of the Chiropractors' Association of Saskatchewan (CAS) and acted as the registrar for the CAS for six years. Moreover, he held the position of president of the Canadian Federation of Chiropractic Regulatory, Educational, and Accreditation Board (CRCREAB) for four years.

On a personal note, Kitchen shares his life with his wife, Donna, and together they have raised three grown children named Andrew, Kathryn, and Stephen.
