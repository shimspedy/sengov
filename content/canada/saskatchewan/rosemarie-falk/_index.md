Rosemarie Ashley Falk, a Canadian politician from Saskatchewan, has been an influential figure in the House of Commons of Canada since her victorious by-election campaign in 2017. Born and raised in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, Falk proudly represents the Battlefords—Lloydminster riding as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada caucus. Her dedication to public service and commitment to her constituents are evident in her current role as the Deputy Shadow Minister for Families, Children and Social Development and Status of Women.

Education and Early Career:
Rosemarie Falk's educational journey led her to acquire a Bachelor of Social Work from the esteemed University of Calgary. Before entering the political arena, Falk garnered valuable experience in her field by working as a registered Social Worker in Saskatchewan. Additionally, she served as a legal assistant and a legislative assistant in federal politics, honing her skills and expanding her knowledge in various capacities. Falk's strong foundation in social work and her firsthand experience with legislative processes have shaped her understanding of the diverse needs and concerns of the Canadian population.

Personal Life:
Beyond her professional achievements, Rosemarie Falk finds fulfillment in her role as a dedicated mother of three. During her initial foray into politics in 2017, Falk's occupation was listed as a stay-at-home parent, highlighting her commitment to both her family and her community.

Political Career:
Falk's political career gained momentum when she decided to run as the Conservative candidate for Battlefords—Lloydminster in the 2017 federal by-election. This election followed the resignation of long-standing Conservative MP Gerry Ritz, and Falk emerged victorious, securing an impressive 70% of the vote share with 8,952 votes out of 12,876. Her campaign focused on presenting voters with a positive Conservative vision and championing affordability, aligning with Andrew Scheer's cost of living platform.

Rosemarie Falk's dedication to her constituents was further exemplified in the 2019 Canadian Federal election, where she was successfully re-elected on October 21. Falk's impressive support resulted in her earning an astounding 79 percent of the vote, totaling 27,784 votes. Her steadfast commitment to Canadian taxpayers, families, and rural communities drove her campaign, and she pledged to continue being their strong voice in Ottawa.

Throughout her tenure, Falk has actively participated in parliamentary sessions, notably serving as a member of the Human Resources, Skills and Social Development, and the Status of Persons with Disabilities Parliament Session from January 29, 2018, to September 11, 2019. Prior to her election to Parliament, she also worked as an assistant to Conservative MP Arnold Viersen, further strengthening her understanding of the legislative process and the importance of effective representation.

Political Views:
In her Maiden Speech in the House of Commons, Rosemarie Falk expressed pride in promoting fundamental Canadian values such as freedom of conscience, thought, and belief. She advocated for the removal of the "Liberal values test" from Canadian summer job applications, urging the government to respect the diversity of beliefs and opinions held by Canadians. Falk has been an advocate for the development of pipelines and has supported the Conservative three-point platform for environmental action. She is also a proponent of a compassionate, fair, and orderly legal immigration system.

Controversy:
Falk faced controversy following her high-five gesture with Conservative MP Dane Lloyd after voting against Bill C-262 on May 30, 2018. This act drew social media backlash and condemnation from First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde. In response, Falk clarified that the high-five was unrelated to the specific vote and released a statement to address the issue. Bill C-262 aimed to align Canadian laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, reflecting the ongoing discussions and challenges surrounding Indigenous rights in Canada.
