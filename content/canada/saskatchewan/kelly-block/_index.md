Kelly Block MP, born on November 30, 1961, is a Canadian politician known for her dedicated service to the people of Canada. Since 2015, she has been representing the electoral district of Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek in the House of Commons. However, her political journey began earlier when she was first elected in the 2008 Canadian federal election as the Member of Parliament for the Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar district.

Before entering federal politics, Block showcased her leadership skills as the mayor of Waldheim, Saskatchewan, serving two terms. Her election as Waldheim's first female mayor was a testament to her ability to break barriers and create positive change. Additionally, Block held the esteemed position of chairperson of the Gabriel Springs Health District, where she contributed to enhancing healthcare services in her community.

Block's commitment to public service extended further when she was appointed to the Saskatoon Regional Health Authority, following the amalgamation of health districts by the government of Saskatchewan. Her involvement in healthcare administration demonstrated her dedication to promoting the well-being of others.

In her political career, Block aligns herself with the Conservative Party. Her contributions as a parliamentarian are commendable, as she has served on several influential committees. Initially, she was appointed to the Procedure and House Affairs Committee (PROC) and the Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics Committee (ETHI). Later, she transitioned to the budget and finance committee, where she played a pivotal role starting in the fall of 2009. With the advent of the 41st Parliament in 2011, Block's responsibilities expanded as she was appointed to the health committee and the government operations and estimates committee. Prime Minister Stephen Harper recognized her capabilities and entrusted her with the role of regional caucus chairperson for the Saskatchewan Conservative caucus.

Block's dedication to her role as a parliamentarian earned her recognition and accolades. In June 2010, she was awarded the prestigious Maclean's Parliamentarian of the Year – Rising Star – Award. Her fellow parliamentarians from all parties recognized her outstanding contributions by granting her the highest number of weighted votes.

In her career, Block faced challenges and controversies that tested her resolve. In October 2012, she distributed a flyer to her constituents titled "Ending Unfair Benefits for Refugee Claimants." The content of the flyer, which criticized refugee claimants and denied extended healthcare benefits to refugee applicants, attracted media attention and parliamentary criticism. Block stood by the message but expressed regret regarding certain language used, emphasizing that the content was still a draft.

Following the redrawing of Saskatchewan's federal electoral boundaries in 2013, Block announced her intention to run in the newly created riding of Humboldt-Warman-Martensville-Rosetown, later renamed Carlton Trail-Eagle Creek.

Block's contributions to the natural resources sector were recognized when she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Natural Resources in September 2013.

In the 2015 federal election, despite the Liberal Party's victory, Block emerged triumphant in the redrawn riding of Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek. Interim leader Rona Ambrose appointed her as the Conservative critic for Transport, highlighting her expertise and commitment to public infrastructure.

Block's commitment to her constituents was reaffirmed in the 2019 federal election when she was re-elected with an increased margin, reflecting the trust and confidence placed in her by the voters. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer recognized her capabilities and appointed her as the Opposition critic for Public Services and Procurement Canada.

Block's impact on parliamentary proceedings continued to grow when she was elected Chair of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on October 15, 2020. In this role, she played a crucial part in ensuring transparency and accountability in government expenditures.

Demonstrating her commitment to defending fundamental freedoms, Block introduced the Protection of Freedom of Conscience Act in February 2021. This legislation aimed to protect the rights of individuals to act in accordance with their conscience, providing an essential safeguard for personal beliefs.

Kelly Block's biography serves as a testament to her dedication, leadership, and commitment to public service. Her accomplishments as a politician, mayor, healthcare advocate, and committee member highlight her tireless efforts to improve the lives of her constituents and all Canadians.
