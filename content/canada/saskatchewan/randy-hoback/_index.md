Randy C. Hoback MP, born on December 19, 1967, is a Canadian politician and member of the Conservative Party. He began his political career in 2008 when he was elected to represent the electoral district of Prince Albert in the Canadian federal election. He has since been re-elected in the 2011, 2015, and 2019 federal elections, demonstrating his continued support from the constituents of Prince Albert.

Hoback's educational background includes a business administration certificate from the University of Saskatchewan and a Chartered Director's designation from McMaster University and the Conference Board of Canada. These credentials have equipped him with a strong foundation in business management and governance.

Before entering politics, Hoback gained valuable experience working for prominent farm machinery manufacturers. From 1986 to 2000, he held positions at Flexicoil and later Case New Holland. In 2000, he made the decision to purchase his family farm, marking a significant transition in his career. He expanded the farm to an impressive 3,300 acres (13 km2) and ventured into the custom spraying and trucking business. Hoback's contributions to agriculture were recognized when he was nominated for the Saskatchewan Outstanding Young Farmer Award in 2005.

Throughout his career, Hoback has been actively involved in various agricultural associations. He served as the chairman of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association (WCWGA) and represented the association in World Trade Organization meetings held in Geneva and Hong Kong. His involvement in these international discussions showcases his commitment to promoting the interests of Canadian farmers on a global scale.

As a Member of Parliament, Hoback has served on several important committees. He was a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food, and the Standing Committee on Finance. Notably, he assumed the role of chair of the Standing Committee on International Trade on October 16, 2014, until the 2015 federal election. He also held positions of leadership within his party, serving as the chair of the Saskatchewan Conservative Caucus and as the Vice Chair of the Standing Committee on International Trade.

Hoback's dedication to parliamentary participation extends beyond his national responsibilities. In 2010, he was elected as chair of the Canadian Section of ParlAmericas, an organization that promotes inter-parliamentary dialogue and collaboration in the inter-American system. He further demonstrated his commitment by being elected President of ParlAmericas in February 2011, a position he held during the Association's 8th Annual FIPA-Parlamericas meeting in Asuncion, Paraguay. Currently, he serves as the organization's Past-President, leveraging his expertise to foster legislative cooperation and democratic development in the Americas.

During the 43rd Canadian Parliament, Hoback introduced a private member bill called Bill C-234, also known as An Act to amend the Income Tax Act (home security measures). The bill aimed to establish a federal tax credit for expenses related to acquiring, installing, or maintaining a security system in a dwelling or accessory building. Although it received support solely from members of the Conservative Party, the bill was defeated in a vote on June 9, 2021. This legislative effort highlights Hoback's commitment to addressing issues of home security and protecting Canadian citizens.

Born and raised in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Hoback remains connected to his roots. He is married and has two children, reflecting his dedication to family values and his understanding of the importance of a strong community foundation. Through his political career, Hoback continues to champion the interests of his constituents and make significant contributions to the Canadian political landscape.
