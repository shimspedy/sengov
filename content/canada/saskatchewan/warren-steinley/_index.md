Warren Steinley MP, born on April 27, 1982, is a Canadian politician who has made significant contributions to the political landscape of Canada. In the 2019 Canadian federal election, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for the riding of Regina—Lewvan, representing the Conservative Party.

Steinley has been actively involved in various parliamentary roles. Currently, he serves as the Associate Shadow Minister for Agriculture, Agri-Food, and Food Security, utilizing his expertise in these areas. Additionally, he is a valued member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, where he diligently works towards addressing agricultural challenges and ensuring food security.

Warren Steinley's early life was deeply rooted in the farming community. Growing up near Rush Lake, Saskatchewan, he was raised on a dairy and beef farm. His family had a profound connection with Holstein cattle, actively participating in showcasing these animals across Western Canada. For generations, the Steinley Brothers proudly displayed their animals, and the Park Lane prefix became synonymous with excellence in the dairy show circuits.

Throughout his youth, Warren demonstrated a passion for sports and athleticism. He excelled in competitive football, track and field, and hockey, even earning the opportunity to play in the Saskatchewan Senior Bowl, a prestigious event for top high school graduating football players. Following high school, he played hockey for the La Ronge Ice Wolves in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League.

Warren's pursuit of knowledge and commitment to public service led him to the University of Regina, where he obtained an Honours Degree in Political Science. During his time at the university, he was a key member of the University of Regina Cougars Track and Field team. Additionally, he co-founded the local Saskatchewan Party Campus Club, actively engaging with political affairs on campus. After completing his undergraduate studies, Warren embarked on an internship with Hon. Gerry Ritz, the Minister of Agriculture in Ottawa. He then served in the office of Hon. Lynne Yelich, the Minister of Western Economic Diversification. In 2009, he returned to Saskatchewan and joined the Saskatchewan Public Service within the Ministry of Executive Council, contributing as a dedicated researcher. Later, he assumed the role of Director of Research within the Government Caucus. In 2011, Warren's dedication and expertise were recognized when he was elected as an MLA in the Saskatchewan general election.

Over the years, Steinley actively participated in leadership races for both the Saskatchewan Party and the Conservative Party of Canada. In 2017, he served as the Saskatchewan campaign chair for Andrew Scheer's leadership bid. Furthermore, he co-chaired Erin O'Toole's successful leadership campaign in 2020.

From 2011 to 2019, Warren Steinley served as a Member of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly, representing Regina Walsh-Acres. During his tenure, he fulfilled various responsibilities, including Deputy Caucus Chair and Chair of the Private Bills House Committee. Additionally, he contributed his expertise as a member of the Standing Committee of Intergovernmental Affairs and Justice, as well as the Standing Committee of Human Services. Steinley was actively involved in the community and served as a board member of Innovation Saskatchewan and the Provincial Capital Commission. He also played a role in the 2013 Grey Cup Executive Committee.

In 2020, Steinley decided to step down as MLA, passing on his torch to Derek Meyers. Subsequently, he focused his efforts on the 2019 Canadian federal election. Interestingly, he resigned from his provincial seat on the same day the writs of election were issued, displaying his unwavering commitment to public service. Although a by-election was not held to fill the resulting vacancy in the legislature, Warren Steinley's decision was guided by

 financial considerations and the proximity to the upcoming 2020 Saskatchewan provincial election, as indicated by Saskatchewan's Premier, Scott Moe.

Beyond his political endeavors, Warren values his personal life. In 2009, he married his wife Larissa, and they have been blessed with three young children. Furthermore, he continued his educational journey and obtained a Master's Degree in Public Administration from the University of Regina through the Johnson Shoyama School of Public Policy in 2018.
