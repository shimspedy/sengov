Gérard Deltell MP, born on August 8, 1964, is a Canadian politician renowned for his distinguished career in public service. Currently serving as the member of Parliament (MP) for Louis-Saint-Laurent since 2015, Deltell has made a significant impact through his dedicated involvement in politics. A prominent member of the Conservative Party, he held the esteemed position of Opposition House Leader from 2020 to 2022 under the leadership of Erin O'Toole. Throughout his tenure, Deltell also assumed several crucial roles as an opposition critic, showcasing his depth of knowledge and unwavering commitment to public welfare.

Before venturing into federal politics, Deltell served as a representative for Chauveau in the National Assembly of Quebec from 2008 to 2015. Notably, he led the Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ) from 2009 until its merger with the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) in 2012, thereafter assuming the role of CAQ's house leader until 2014. This transition marked a pivotal period in his political journey, allowing him to broaden his impact and contribute to the betterment of Quebec's governance.

Born and raised in Quebec City, Deltell's early life laid the foundation for his illustrious career. His parents, both Pied-Noirs born in Algeria during the time when it was part of France, instilled in him a strong sense of heritage and cultural diversity. With French citizenship acquired through his parents' lineage, Deltell embraced his multicultural background. The surname "Deltell" reflects his Spanish roots, as his father's family settled in Algeria in the 19th century, while his maternal family's ancestry spans French and Italian origins. In 1958, his parents immigrated to Canada, eventually settling in Loretteville, near Quebec City. Deltell's father, Guy, served in a Moroccan regiment of the French Army during World War II and received the prestigious French Legion of Honour in recognition of his valor.

Academically, Deltell pursued his passion for social science at Cégep de Sainte-Foy, graduating in 1984. He continued his intellectual pursuits at Université Laval, where he majored in history and earned his degree in 1989. Complementing his educational background, Deltell acquired valuable skills as an announcer through training at the Collège des annonceurs radio télévision in 1982 and at École de radio et de télévision Promédia in 1993. Additionally, his diverse interests led him to obtain a pilot's license for ultralight aircraft in 2005, showcasing his adventurous spirit.

Before dedicating his life to public service, Deltell forged a successful career in journalism. His experience as a TV correspondent with TQS, as well as his work with TVA and Radio-Canada stations in Quebec City, equipped him with invaluable insights into the media landscape. Additionally, his role as a radio show host at CIRO-FM radio station further honed his communication skills. Deltell's contributions as a journalist spanned over 20 years, earning him a reputation for his professionalism and dedication to delivering accurate news to the public.

Deltell's entry into provincial politics came in 2008 when he contested as the Action démocratique du Québec candidate in the district of Chauveau during the provincial election. His resounding victory, securing 44% of the vote, marked the beginning of a transformative chapter in his political journey. Notably, on November 19, 2009, Deltell assumed the leadership of the ADQ, playing a pivotal role in stabilizing the party following a power vacuum caused by the 200

9 leadership race. Through his strategic leadership, he successfully revitalized the ADQ's popularity, bringing them back to 20% in the polls and making significant inroads in Conservative strongholds such as the Quebec City region.

In a remarkable turn of events, Deltell's leadership came to an end with the dissolution of the ADQ, as it merged with the new movement established by François Legault, forming the Coalition Avenir Québec. Undeterred by this change, Deltell transitioned seamlessly into the CAQ, serving as the parliamentary leader of the caucus until the 2012 Quebec general election. Subsequently, from 2012 to 2014, he assumed the role of house leader for the CAQ, contributing to effective legislative processes and shaping the party's agenda.

With his remarkable track record and unwavering commitment to public service, Deltell embarked on a new chapter in his political career, transitioning to federal politics. On April 7, 2015, he announced his candidacy for the Conservative Party of Canada in the riding of Louis-Saint-Laurent for the upcoming federal election. Simultaneously, he resigned as MNA for Chauveau, marking a significant turning point in his political trajectory. As fate would have it, Deltell emerged victorious in the federal election held on October 19, 2015, garnering increased support for the Conservative Party in the Quebec City region. This victory solidified his standing as a rising star within the Conservative caucus.

Since assuming his role in Ottawa, Deltell has consistently showcased his acumen and dedication to public service. His exceptional performances during Question Period have garnered widespread praise and established him as a prominent figure within the Conservative Party. Recognizing his capabilities, Opposition Leader Rona Ambrose appointed Deltell as the party's Quebec lieutenant and critic for Employment, Workforce, and Labour. Notably, he was mentioned as a potential leadership candidate to succeed former leader Stephen Harper, garnering support from within the Conservative caucus. However, Deltell wholeheartedly endorsed Erin O'Toole, affirming his commitment to the party's vision and collective progress. Moreover, Deltell expressed his opposition to the legalization of marijuana, vowing to prevent its implementation, although it was eventually legalized in 2018.

Acknowledging his expertise and leadership qualities, Deltell was appointed to the Special Committee on Electoral Reform, serving as one of three Conservatives on the committee. This appointment further demonstrated his commitment to ensuring fair and effective electoral processes in Canada.

On October 16, 2016, Deltell achieved yet another milestone in his political career when he was designated the Official Opposition Finance Critic by Rona Ambrose, the interim leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. This prestigious role highlighted his deep understanding of economic matters and his ability to contribute meaningfully to financial discussions. As Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer unveiled his shadow cabinet on August 30, 2017, Deltell assumed the role of critic for the Treasury Board, underscoring his diverse range of expertise and his dedication to promoting good governance.

Continuing to make significant contributions to the Conservative Party, Deltell's leadership and capabilities were once again recognized by Erin O'Toole. On September 2, 2020, it was announced that Deltell would serve as Opposition House Leader, succeeding Candice Bergen. This appointment further solidified his reputation as a respected and influential figure within the party, entrusted with key responsibilities in shaping parliamentary affairs and promoting the interests of the Opposition.

Throughout his career, Gérard Deltell MP has exemplified a steadfast commitment to public service and a tireless dedication to the well-being of his constituents and fellow Canadians. With his remarkable achievements and exceptional leadership qualities, he continues to shape the

 political landscape, leaving an indelible mark on Canadian politics.
