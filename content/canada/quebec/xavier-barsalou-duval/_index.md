Xavier Barsalou-Duval MP, born on November 10, 1988, is a Canadian politician with a notable career in public service. He emerged as a prominent figure in Canadian politics after being elected to represent the riding of Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères in the House of Commons during the 2015 federal election.

Barsalou-Duval's journey in politics began earlier, as he served as the president of the Forum jeunesse du Bloc Québécois from 2011 to 2015. During this period, he actively engaged in political activities and played a vital role in the organization. His dedication and commitment were evident when he campaigned for Mario Beaulieu during the 2014 leadership race, demonstrating his support for the cause he believed in.

Despite facing challenges during his initial political endeavors, Barsalou-Duval's determination and perseverance propelled him to success. In the 2015 federal election, he secured a seat in the House of Commons. It is worth noting that he achieved this victory despite receiving the lowest percentage of the vote among all Members of Parliament. This outcome was largely attributed to vote splitting and a fiercely contested race in his riding, underscoring the competitiveness of the electoral process.

Throughout his political career, Barsalou-Duval has remained steadfast in his commitment to the Bloc Québécois. In a display of loyalty and conviction, he stood alongside Martine Ouellet during a caucus revolt, marking himself as one of three Bloc MPs who supported her leadership. Furthermore, when seven Members of Parliament decided to resign and sit as Independents on February 28, 2018, Barsalou-Duval chose to remain with the Bloc caucus, emphasizing his unwavering dedication to the party's principles.

In addition to his political endeavors, Barsalou-Duval shares a personal connection with another influential figure in Canadian politics. He is happily married to fellow Bloc MP Marilène Gill, demonstrating their shared passion for public service and their commitment to advancing the goals of the Bloc Québécois.

Xavier Barsalou-Duval's story is one of resilience, determination, and unwavering dedication to his political ideals. As he continues to serve in the House of Commons, his contributions and advocacy for the people he represents remain at the forefront of his political agenda.
