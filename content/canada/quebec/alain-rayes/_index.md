Alain Rayes, a Canadian politician, was born on December 11, 1971, in Victoriaville, Quebec. He is the eldest of four children in a family originally from Egypt. Rayes obtained a Bachelor of Mathematics, specializing in teaching computer science, and later pursued a master's degree in educational administration. His passion for education led him to begin his career as a teacher before taking on various management positions, including Director of the Polyvalente Le Boisé Victoriaville.

Rayes' political journey started with a candidacy for the Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ) alongside Mario Dumont during the 2003 Quebec general election. Although he finished second in Arthabaska, this experience laid the foundation for his future endeavors. Rayes transitioned to municipal politics and achieved great success, becoming the mayor of Victoriaville in Quebec's 2009 municipal elections. He was reelected in 2013 by acclamation, demonstrating the trust and support he garnered from the community.

During his tenure as mayor, Rayes spearheaded various initiatives aimed at enhancing the quality of life in Victoriaville. Under his leadership, notable projects were undertaken, including the construction of the cultural venue "Le Carré 150," the Édouard-Dubord Pool, the Yvon-Paré Stadium, the Gateway Beaudet reservoir, the entertainment site at the youth baseball place of Victoriaville Stadium, the Sani-Marc sports complex, and the Promutuel Sports Complex.

After six successful years as mayor, Rayes decided to transition to federal politics. In October 2015, he was elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Richmond—Arthabaska in the House of Commons of Canada. Rayes continued to gain the trust of his constituents and was reelected in both the 2019 and 2021 federal elections.

Rayes quickly made his mark in federal politics, being appointed as the deputy spokesman for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness following his election as MP. Within this role, he took charge of addressing the marijuana legalization issue, showcasing his ability to navigate complex policy matters. Additionally, Rayes became known for his involvement in the party's discussions on electoral reform, working alongside Gérard Deltell as an official spokesperson.

Throughout his political career, Rayes has been a dedicated member of the Conservative Party. After Andrew Scheer's victory in the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, Rayes served as Scheer's Quebec lieutenant from 2017 to 2019. His contribution to the party's leadership team and his commitment to representing Quebec were invaluable during this period. Rayes briefly stepped away from this role but resumed his position as Quebec lieutenant on November 8, 2021. However, he resigned on February 6, 2022, to actively participate in the Conservative leadership election.

On September 13, 2022, Rayes made the difficult decision to leave the Conservative caucus following Pierre Poilievre's victory in the leadership race. He stated that his values were incompatible with the new leadership and identified himself as a "Progressive Conservative." Rayes chose to continue serving in the House of Commons as an independent member, representing the constituents of Richmond—Arthabaska.

In the face of challenges, Rayes remained steadfast and focused on his commitment to public service. He demonstrated resilience when allegations of intimidation arose, claiming that text messages were sent to Conservative members in his riding to pressure him into resigning his seat. Although the party apologized to the members of the riding, Rayes noted that the apology was not personally directed at him and expressed his desire to move forward from this incident.

Alain Rayes' political

 journey showcases his unwavering dedication to serving his constituents and making a positive impact on his community. His passion for education, experience in municipal leadership, and contributions to federal politics have shaped him into a respected and influential figure in Canadian politics. As he continues his journey as an independent member, Rayes remains committed to representing the people of Richmond—Arthabaska and pursuing the values he holds dear.
