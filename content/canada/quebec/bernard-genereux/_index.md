Bernard Généreux MP, born on April 23, 1962, is a distinguished Canadian politician renowned for his notable contributions to public service. Généreux embarked on his political journey when he secured a resounding victory in the federal by-elections held on November 9, 2009, earning him the privilege to represent the esteemed electoral district of Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup in the House of Commons. He proudly represents the Conservative Party, advocating for the principles and values that resonate with his constituents.

Before his foray into federal politics, Généreux dedicated himself to serving the community as the esteemed Mayor of La Pocatière. His time in this influential position allowed him to foster a deep understanding of the needs and aspirations of the local populace. Généreux's commitment to his constituents, coupled with his exceptional leadership skills, propelled him towards making a lasting impact on the lives of those he served.

During the 2011 general election, Généreux's electoral victory was initially announced, solidifying his continued representation of his district. However, a subsequent review of the polling station tallies unveiled a discrepancy, leading to a narrow defeat by a mere five votes to his New Democratic Party opponent, François Lapointe. This unforeseen outcome did not deter Généreux's unwavering dedication to public service. With resilience and determination, he tirelessly campaigned in the following federal election in 2015, where he emerged victorious by securing over 200 votes, reclaiming his rightful place as the representative for his district.

In the subsequent federal election of 2019, Généreux's unwavering commitment to his constituents and steadfast leadership qualities garnered him significant support, leading to another resounding victory. With this triumph, Généreux secured his position as a trusted advocate for the people, ready to champion their concerns and aspirations in the hallowed halls of the House of Commons.

Bernard Généreux's remarkable political career exemplifies his deep-rooted passion for public service and his dedication to making a positive impact in the lives of his constituents. Through his unwavering commitment to his district and his tireless advocacy for their needs, Généreux continues to be an influential and respected figure in Canadian politics.
