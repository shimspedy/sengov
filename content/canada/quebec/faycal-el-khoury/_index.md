Fayçal El-Khoury, born on May 15, 1955, is a Canadian Liberal politician hailing from Lebanese heritage. He made his mark in Canadian politics by securing a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as the representative for the electoral district of Laval—Les Îles during the 2015 federal election. Garnering an impressive 47.7% of the vote, El-Khoury emerged victorious.

El-Khoury's journey in politics is complemented by his educational background in engineering, having obtained a degree from Concordia University. Born in Lebanon, he made the life-changing decision to immigrate to Canada in 1976, seeking new opportunities and embracing the Canadian way of life.
