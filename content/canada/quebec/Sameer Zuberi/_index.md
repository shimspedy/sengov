Sameer Zuberi MP, born in August 1979, is a Canadian politician known for his role as a member of the Liberal Party representing the federal riding of Pierrefonds—Dollard in the House of Commons of Canada. He was elected to this position in the 2019 Canadian federal election.

Zuberi was born and raised in Montreal, and he is the eldest of six children in a multicultural family. His mother is of Scottish and Italian descent, while his father immigrated to Canada from Pakistan in the 1970s. Growing up in Laval, Quebec, Zuberi attended Marianopolis College at CEGEP before pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics from Concordia University, which he completed in 2004. He furthered his education at the Université du Québec à Montréal, where he obtained his law degree (LL.B.) in 2014. During his time at university, Zuberi was honored with the Juanita Westmoreland-Traoré scholarship, recognizing his social engagement and dedication to promoting human rights, social justice, and equality rights.

While studying at Concordia University, Zuberi actively participated in student politics, serving twice as a vice-president at the Concordia Student Union. He also engaged in various advocacy roles, such as being a member of the Concordia Council on Student Life, where he worked towards supporting diversity and fostering a strong sense of community on campus. Additionally, Zuberi served on the board of the City of Montreal's Intercultural Council, demonstrating his commitment to promoting inclusivity and multiculturalism. He also played an active role as a board member of the West Island Assistance Fund and was instrumental in establishing the Quebec Section of the Canadian Muslim Lawyers Association (CMLA). In 2014, he became the Vice-Chair of the Quebec Section and later served as a national board member in 2015.

Outside of his professional and political pursuits, Zuberi is a devoted family man. He is married and has two young daughters.

Zuberi's political career began with his service in The Black Watch, a Canadian Forces reserve unit, from 1997 to 2002. During this time, he contributed to relief efforts during the 1998 Ice Storm. Following his graduation from Concordia University in 2004, Zuberi taught English in Kuwait for a year before returning to Canada in 2006. He joined the Ottawa office of the National Council of Canada Muslims, a non-profit and non-partisan organization advocating for the rights of Muslims in Canada. In this role, he served as the Media Relations and Human Rights Coordinator.

After obtaining his law degree in 2014, Zuberi joined McGill University's Faculty of Medicine as a diversity and engagement officer. He also became an elected member of the Senate at McGill, where he actively promoted diversity and inclusion for Black and Indigenous students, as well as those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and rural Quebec.

Zuberi's foray into electoral politics began in November 2013 when he ran as a city councillor in the Bois-de-Liesse district of the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough. Although he ranked third with 22.93% of the votes, this experience laid the foundation for his future political ambitions. When Frank Baylis, the Member of Parliament for Pierrefonds-Roxboro, announced he would not seek re-election, Zuberi joined the nomination contest as a Liberal Party candidate. Facing five other contenders, Zuberi emerged victorious in one of the party's largest nominations, garnering 9,000 registered votes and a turnout of 3,200. His success in the nomination process paved the way for his election as a member of the 43rd Canadian Parliament, defeating the Conservative Party

 candidate.

During his tenure as an elected Member of Parliament, Zuberi has served on several parliamentary committees, including the Committee on Justice and Human Rights, Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations, and the Subcommittee on International Human Rights of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. He has been actively involved in advocating for human rights and has co-chaired the bipartisan Canadian-Uyghur Parliamentary Friendship Group. Zuberi has been at the forefront of raising awareness about human rights abuses against the Uyghur community in China, resulting in the adoption of a motion recognizing China's actions as genocide. He has also championed initiatives supporting small businesses in his constituency, collaborating with the West Island Chamber of Commerce to establish a small business outreach program.

Zuberi's commitment to public service and his dedication to promoting human rights, social justice, and equality rights have solidified his position as a respected and influential member of the Canadian political landscape. Currently, he serves as the Chair of the Subcommittee on International Human Rights of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development and as the Vice-Chair of the Scrutiny of Regulations Committee. He is also a member of the Joint Committee of the Scrutiny of Regulations.
