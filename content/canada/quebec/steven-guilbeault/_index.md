Steven Guilbeault PC MP, born on June 9, 1970, is a Canadian politician and former activist. He currently serves as the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, a position he has held since October 26, 2021. Guilbeault is a member of the Liberal Party and has been a Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Montreal riding of Laurier–Sainte-Marie since the 2019 federal election. Prior to his role as Minister of Environment and Climate Change, he served as the Minister of Canadian Heritage from 2019 to 2021.

Guilbeault's passion for environmental activism began early in life. At the age of five, growing up in La Tuque, he climbed a tree to protest against a land developer clearing a wooded area near his home. This event sparked his lifelong commitment to environmental causes.

After studying computer science in CEGEP, Guilbeault pursued a degree in industrial relations at the Université de Montréal in 1989. He later switched his major to political science and minored in theology, focusing on international morality, liberation theology, poverty, and the environment. During his time in university, Guilbeault became involved in various student associations and human rights organizations.

Guilbeault co-founded Équiterre, a Quebec environmental organization, and served as its director and campaign manager for ten years. In 1997, he joined Greenpeace Canada, where he led the climate change division and managed the climate and energy campaign. He gained international attention when he scaled Toronto's CN Tower in 2001 to raise awareness about climate change. Guilbeault remained active in the environmental movement, working on climate change issues for Équiterre and serving on government advisory committees in Quebec.

Beyond his environmental activism, Guilbeault has been involved in media and consulting roles. He has worked as a commentator for CBC/Radio-Canada, La Presse, and Corporate Knights magazine. He has also served as a columnist for the Métro newspaper and worked as a senior consultant for Deloitte and Touche. Additionally, Guilbeault has been a strategic consultant for Cycle Capital Management's venture capital fund, focusing on clean technologies.

In 2019, Guilbeault entered politics as a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the Laurier—Sainte-Marie riding. He won the election and became a Member of Parliament. Shortly after, he was appointed as the Minister of Canadian Heritage, where he served until 2021.

Guilbeault gained attention for introducing Bill C-10 in 2021, a proposed amendment to the Broadcasting Act aimed at modernizing the legislation to include online broadcasting services. The bill faced criticism and concerns regarding freedom of speech and expression on social media platforms.

Following the 2021 federal election, Guilbeault was appointed as the Minister of Environment and Climate Change. His appointment received both praise and criticism due to his background as a former environmental activist. In this role, he has been tasked with implementing Canada's emissions reduction plans and addressing climate change issues.

Throughout his career, Guilbeault has been recognized for his contributions to environmental activism and sustainability. He is a member of the Cercle des Phénix de l'environnement du Québec and an honorary fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. He has received several awards, including the Médaille de l'Université de Montréal and the Blanche-Lemco-Van-Ginkel award from the Ordre des urbanistes du Québec.

Steven Guilbeault continues to work towards a more sustainable future, combining his passion for the environment with his role as a Canadian politician.
