Simon-Pierre Savard-Tremblay, a Canadian politician, rose to prominence as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada after winning the 2019 election. He proudly represents the electoral district of Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot as a member of the Bloc Québécois.

Born and raised in Quebec City, Simon-Pierre Savard-Tremblay later made Montreal his home to pursue his college studies in economic and social sciences at Collège Stanislas. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in political science from the Université de Montréal, followed by a master's degree in sociology from the Université du Québec in Montreal. In 2018, he achieved a doctorate in socio-economics of development from the prestigious School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris, under the guidance of Jacques Sapir and Florence Weber.

Savard-Tremblay's passion for politics led him to serve as the Chair of the Forum jeunesse du Bloc Québécois from 2010 to 2012, notably during the significant 2011 federal election. Throughout his career, he also contributed as a columnist to various media outlets, including a blog at the Journal de Montréal.

While initially advocating conservative views, Savard-Tremblay gradually shifted his stance towards embracing left nationalism and economic nationalism, while remaining critical of neoliberalism. He openly expresses his admiration for the eminent British economist John Maynard Keynes, whom he reveres as "the greatest economist of the 20th century" and "the great thinker of society."

In April 2019, Savard-Tremblay embarked on his campaign to secure the nomination of the Bloc Québécois in the Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot riding. His unwavering dedication and support from constituents propelled him to victory, as he emerged victorious in the federal elections held in October 2019. Since then, he has diligently served as a Member of Parliament, striving to represent and address the needs and aspirations of his constituents on the national stage.
