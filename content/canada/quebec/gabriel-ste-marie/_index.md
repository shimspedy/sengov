Gabriel Ste-Marie is a distinguished Canadian politician, academic, and economist who has made significant contributions to both academia and public service. Born in Canada, Ste-Marie embarked on a remarkable journey that would lead him to become a Member of Parliament (MP) and a respected figure in the field of economics.

In 2015, Ste-Marie successfully contested the election to represent the riding of Joliette in the House of Commons, marking the beginning of his political career. Alongside his political endeavors, he has been dedicated to education, sharing his expertise in economics as a professor at the Cégep régional de Lanaudière.

Ste-Marie's impact extends beyond the classroom and into the realm of politics. From 2017 to 2018, he assumed the role of Bloc Québécois House Leader, effectively serving as the party's parliamentary leader due to the absence of the party leader in parliament. However, a disagreement with party leader Martine Ouellet led Ste-Marie to resign from his position on February 25, 2018. Subsequently, he and six other Bloc MPs chose to sit as independent Members of Parliament on February 28, 2018, due to conflicts arising from Ouellet's leadership style. Demonstrating his commitment to his political party and its values, Ste-Marie eventually reunited with the Bloc Québécois caucus on September 17, 2018.

Beyond his political engagements, Ste-Marie's passion for economics and research has propelled him to contribute significantly to the field. He holds a research position at the Contemporary Economics Research Institute, where he explores and delves into contemporary economic issues. Moreover, his expertise is sought after by students at the Université du Québec à Montréal, where he shares his knowledge as a lecturer.

Gabriel Ste-Marie's multifaceted career showcases his dedication to both education and politics. With his continued contributions to academia, research, and public service, he remains an influential figure in Canada's political and economic landscape.
