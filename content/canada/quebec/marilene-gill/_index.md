Marilène Gill MP, a prominent Canadian politician, rose to prominence when she won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada during the 2015 election. Representing the electoral district of Manicouagan, she is a dedicated member of the Bloc Québécois.

While seven MPs chose to resign and sit as Independents on February 28, 2018, Gill remained loyal to the Bloc caucus, exemplifying her unwavering dedication to her party and its values.

Beyond her political career, Gill shares a deep personal connection with her husband, Xavier Barsalou-Duval, who is also a Bloc MP. Their shared commitment to public service and their aligned political goals undoubtedly strengthen their bond both personally and professionally.

Marilène Gill MP continues to play an influential role in Canadian politics, utilizing her position to advocate for the interests of her constituents and contribute to the political landscape of her country.
