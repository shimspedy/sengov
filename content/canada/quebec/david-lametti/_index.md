David T. Lametti PC KC MP, born on August 10, 1962, is a Canadian politician and lawyer who currently serves as the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. He has been in this role since 2019. Lametti is a member of the Liberal Party and represents LaSalle—Émard—Verdun as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons, a position he has held since 2015.

Lametti was born in Port Colborne, Ontario, Canada, to Italian immigrants. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and political science from the University of Toronto in 1985. Later, he pursued his legal studies at McGill University, Yale University, and Exeter College, Oxford. In 1989, Lametti served as a clerk to Justice Peter Cory of the Supreme Court of Canada. He went on to earn a Master of Laws degree from Yale Law School in 1991 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in law from Exeter College, Oxford in 1999. His doctoral thesis focused on the ethical aspects of the theory and practice of private property.

Before entering politics, Lametti held a prominent position as a professor of law at McGill University. He was a member of the Institute of Comparative Law and played a significant role in establishing the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy. Lametti joined the faculty at McGill in 1995 and steadily climbed the academic ranks, becoming a full professor with tenure in 2015. His expertise lies in civil and common law property, intellectual property, property theory, and ethics. Lametti's scholarly contributions have enriched the field, and he has published extensively on subjects related to property, intellectual property, and social norms.

In addition to his academic pursuits, Lametti had a passion for sports. He served as the co-captain of the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club alongside Mark Carney. Furthermore, Lametti actively contributed to his community by coaching youth soccer teams in Montreal leagues.

Lametti's interest in politics was sparked during his teenage years when he volunteered for the Liberal Party in various elections. He co-founded the Erie Riding New Liberals, the youth wing of the Liberal Party of Canada in southern Niagara. In 2014, he launched his campaign to become the Liberal Party candidate for the newly created riding of LaSalle-Émard-Verdun. Lametti emerged as the successful nominee on February 8, 2015, and went on to secure a seat in Parliament in the 2015 Canadian federal election. In December 2015, he was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Minister of International Trade and later reshuffled to parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development in January 2017.

On January 14, 2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Lametti as the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, recognizing his legal expertise and dedication to public service. In recognition of his contributions, he was appointed as a Queen's Counsel on April 15, 2019. While serving in his ministerial role and as a Member of Parliament, Lametti remains on leave from his position at McGill University.

David T. Lametti's remarkable career encompasses his academic accomplishments, commitment to public service, and advocacy for justice and intellectual property rights. As Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, he continues to play a pivotal role in shaping legal policies and upholding the rule of law in the country.
