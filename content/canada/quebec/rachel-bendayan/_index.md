Rachel Bendayan MP, born on May 10, 1980, is a Canadian politician known for her dedicated service to the House of Commons of Canada. She made her mark on the political landscape by winning a by-election on February 25, 2019, succeeding former New Democratic Party leader Tom Mulcair, who had resigned. Demonstrating her commitment to public service, she was re-elected in both the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections. Bendayan proudly represents the electoral district of Outremont as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.

In December 2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Bendayan as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion, and International Trade, Mary Ng, a role in which she has proven herself as a capable and influential advocate. Her expertise and dedication have made her a valuable asset in promoting the growth and success of small businesses while facilitating international trade.

Bendayan's political journey began earlier when she ran as the Liberal candidate for Outremont in the 2015 Canadian federal election. Though she secured second place, her campaign significantly increased the Liberal Party's vote share. Following the election, Bendayan served as Chief of Staff to Bardish Chagger, the Minister of Small Business and Tourism, demonstrating her versatility and ability to contribute to the Canadian political landscape.

In her early life, Bendayan was raised in a Moroccan-Jewish family, shaping her perspective and values. She pursued her higher education at McGill University, where she studied law and obtained her degree in 2007. Specializing in commercial litigation and international arbitration, Bendayan established a strong foundation for her future endeavors. In addition to her professional achievements, she also shares her knowledge and passion as a faculty member at the Faculty of Law of the University of Montreal.

As a dedicated member of the Liberal Party of Canada, Bendayan contested the Outremont electoral district in the 2015 federal election, facing Thomas Mulcair, the leader of the official opposition at the time. Despite finishing second, she garnered an impressive 33.4% of the vote. After the election, Bendayan assumed the position of Chief of Staff to Bardish Chagger, further immersing herself in the intricacies of Canadian politics and policy-making.

With Thomas Mulcair's departure from political life in June 2018, Bendayan seized the opportunity to once again represent the Liberal Party in the next election. In December 2018, she was nominated as a candidate, contending against the teacher and activist Kim Manning after a vote by members of the constituency. On February 25, the much-anticipated elections took place, and Bendayan emerged victorious, securing 40.4% of the votes. Her nearest opponent, Julia Sánchez from the NDP, trailed behind with 26.1% of the votes.

Bendayan's success continued in the 2019 federal election, where she secured re-election with an impressive 46.2% of the votes, surpassing her closest competitor by a margin of 10,829 votes. As a testament to her skills and dedication, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed her as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion, and International Trade, Mary Ng.

In the 2021 federal election, Bendayan's commitment to serving her constituents and the Liberal Party prevailed once again. With 45.4% of the votes, she triumphed in securing her third consecutive term.

Despite her accomplishments, Bendayan has faced challenges during her political career. Like several other Jewish Liberal Party candidates, she has been subjected to anti-Semitic attacks during the campaign for the 2021 Canadian federal elections. Such incidents included the defacement of her campaign posters with swastik

as, highlighting the ongoing need for vigilance against hate and discrimination.

Rachel Bendayan MP continues to exemplify resilience, dedication, and a commitment to public service. Her contributions to Canadian politics and her representation of the Outremont electoral district have left a lasting impact, inspiring future generations of politicians and advocates for positive change.
