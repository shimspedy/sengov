Alain Therrien MP, born on July 6, 1966, is a prominent Canadian politician renowned for his dedicated service to his constituents and his commitment to the ideals he upholds. He emerged as a representative for the riding of La Prairie in the 2019 federal election, securing his seat as a member of the Bloc Québécois. With a strong focus on advocating for the interests of his region, Therrien has become a respected figure in Canadian politics.

Before embarking on his federal political career, Therrien showcased his leadership skills and dedication to public service as a member of the National Assembly of Quebec. From 2012 to 2018, he effectively represented the riding of Sanguinet as a member of the Parti Québécois. During his tenure in the provincial legislature, Therrien demonstrated his commitment to the values and concerns of his constituents, fostering positive change and promoting the well-being of the community.

Throughout his political journey, Alain Therrien has remained steadfast in his principled approach to governance, always striving to uphold the best interests of the people he represents. His unwavering dedication to his party's objectives has been evident in his consistent alignment with their policies and positions.

On June 17, 2020, Therrien found himself at the center of a heated political exchange when New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh accused him of racism. This accusation arose after Therrien declined a proposed motion aimed at addressing systemic racism and discrimination within the RCMP. Therrien and his party maintained that it was prudent to await the completion of the RCMP's ongoing evaluation before taking further action. In response to Singh's refusal to apologize for his accusations, he was ultimately removed from the House of Commons.

Despite this episode, Alain Therrien's political journey continues, as he remains committed to serving his constituents and working towards a better future for all Canadians. His dedication, experience, and steadfast principles have solidified his place as an influential figure in Canadian politics, with his focus firmly fixed on the betterment of his community and the nation as a whole.
