Rhéal Éloi Fortin MP, a Canadian lawyer and politician, has made a significant impact in his career as a member of the House of Commons for Rivière-du-Nord. Born in Laval-des-Rapides, Quebec, Fortin's journey towards public service began after completing a CEGEP electrician's diploma at the age of 18. He initially worked as a factory laborer in Laval from 1977 to 1985 before deciding to pursue higher education.

With a passion for law, Fortin enrolled at the University of Sherbrooke to study law. After successfully completing his legal education, he commenced his legal practice in Saint-Jérôme in 1992, ultimately establishing himself as a respected lawyer in the region. Currently, he serves as the president of Bissonnette Fortin Giroux, a prominent law firm based in Saint-Jérôme.

Fortin's political journey commenced during his high school years when he actively participated in political activities, such as volunteering for the Parti Québécois and assisting in the placement of lawn signs. He later sought the Parti Québécois nomination for the election for the National Assembly of Quebec in the Prévost riding, although he faced defeat at the hands of Gilles Robert.

In 2015, Fortin's dedication to public service led him to run as a candidate for the Bloc Québécois in the Rivière-du-Nord riding. His perseverance and commitment paid off as he emerged victorious in the election, securing a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. Following the resignation of Gilles Duceppe as the leader of the Bloc Québécois, Fortin was appointed as the interim leader on October 22, 2015. This temporary leadership role lasted until March 18, 2017, when Martine Ouellet assumed the position of the party's leader.

Fortin's dedication to his principles and vision became evident in 2018 when he and six other Bloc MPs resigned from the party's caucus due to disagreements with Ouellet's leadership. They opted to sit as independent MPs and, subsequently, formed a new party known as Québec debout, with Fortin serving as its leader. However, recognizing the importance of a united front, Fortin eventually rejoined the Bloc Québécois caucus on September 17, 2018.

Throughout his political career, Fortin has demonstrated his expertise and commitment by assuming various roles and responsibilities. In the House of Commons, he served as the Bloc Québécois' critic for intergovernmental affairs, human rights, justice, and access to information until February 2018. Subsequently, he and his fellow MPs departed from the caucus to form the Groupe parlementaire québécois in protest of Martine Ouellet's leadership style. Fortin was then named as the group's spokesperson on March 21, 2018.

Rhéal Éloi Fortin's journey as a lawyer and politician exemplifies his unwavering dedication to serving the people of Rivière-du-Nord and advocating for their interests within the political landscape of Canada.
