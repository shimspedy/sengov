Caroline Desbiens, a prominent Canadian politician, has made her mark in the political landscape as a Member of Parliament. Born and raised in Canada, Desbiens embarked on a political journey that would see her elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2019 election, representing the constituency of Beauport—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île d'Orléans—Charlevoix under the banner of the Bloc Québécois.

Desbiens gained attention during the 2019 election campaign when it came to light that she had expressed support for the Charter of Quebec Values on her Facebook page back in 2013. Despite acknowledging the imperfections of the proposed charter, she emphasized the need to back it, fearing that future generations, including her own descendants, might face the compulsion of wearing a veil or risk imprisonment in the years to come. Additionally, in 2016, Desbiens had shown admiration for Marine Le Pen, a far-right French politician, commending her for her resolute convictions. Desbiens' praise for Le Pen on Facebook drew significant scrutiny and criticism. However, Desbiens later expressed deep remorse and issued a formal apology for her previous statements, acknowledging her regret over the matter.

Caroline Desbiens continues to serve as a Member of Parliament, actively contributing to the political discourse and representing the interests of her constituents. Her journey in politics has been marked by both achievements and challenges, with the desire to make a positive impact driving her dedication and commitment to public service.
