Housefather began his political journey in 1994 when he was elected as a municipal councillor in the Town of Hampstead. After the merger of cities on the Montreal island in 2001, he became a municipal councillor in the borough of Côte-Saint-Luc-Hampstead-Montreal West. During this time, he played a crucial role in leading the demerger movement in his borough, successfully advocating for the separation of the municipalities. In 2005, Housefather was elected as the Mayor of the City of Côte-Saint-Luc, a position he held until his election to Parliament in 2015.

In the 2015 Canadian federal election, Housefather was elected as a Member of Parliament for Mount Royal. He quickly gained recognition and was appointed as the Chair of the Justice and Human Rights Committee, where he served from 2015 to 2019. Following the 2019 election, he was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour. In the 2021 federal election, Housefather was reelected and subsequently named the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Services and Procurement.

Housefather is well-educated, holding two law degrees (B.C.L. and LL.B.) from McGill University, as well as an MBA from Concordia University's John Molson School of Business. Prior to his political career, he worked as the Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs and General Counsel at Dialogic Corporation, a multinational technology company.

Outside of politics, Housefather is a talented athlete. He achieved national rankings as a student and made a comeback to competitive swimming in 2010. He earned several medals in swimming masters events at the Maccabiah Games in Israel in 2013 and 2017.

Born and raised in Montreal, Housefather is of Jewish heritage, with all of his grandparents being Montreal natives. He attended Herzliah High School and is fluent in Hebrew.

Throughout his political career, Housefather has been dedicated to serving his constituents and advocating for their interests. He has been reelected multiple times, increasing his margin of victory each time. In addition to his parliamentary duties, Housefather has been actively involved in various committees and has championed important issues such as human rights, justice, and bilingualism.

As of his most recent achievements, Housefather assumed the chairmanship of the Canada-Israel Interparliamentary Group in 2021 and became the vice-chair of the Canada-United States Inter-Parliamentary Group in 2022. He has also been vocal in opposing Quebec's Bill 96, which aims to modify language policies in the province.
