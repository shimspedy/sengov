Born on January 13, 1964, in the charming town of Saint-Narcisse-de-Beaurivage, Quebec, Jacques Gourde has emerged as a prominent figure in Canadian politics, championing the interests of his constituents as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Lévis—Lotbinière. However, Gourde's journey into politics was preceded by a successful career as a farmer and exporter of hay, which granted him invaluable insights into the agricultural sector.

Gourde's political career took flight in the 2006 federal election when he was elected as a Member of Parliament. Shortly after his election, on February 7, 2006, he received a prestigious appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, as well as the Minister for the Canadian Wheat Board. This position allowed Gourde to utilize his deep understanding of farming management and his firsthand experiences in the agricultural industry to influence policies and initiatives that would benefit farmers across the nation.

Demonstrating his versatility and dedication, Gourde later took on additional responsibilities as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Official Languages, and the Economic Development Agency for the Regions of Quebec. Through these roles, he contributed his expertise to a diverse range of areas, including infrastructure, linguistic policies, and economic development, all while continuing to advocate for the interests of his constituents.

Before embarking on his political career, Gourde obtained a diploma in farming management, reflecting his commitment to honing his skills and understanding the intricacies of the agricultural sector. As a producer and exporter of hay in his hometown of Saint-Narcisse-de-Beaurivage, he demonstrated a deep-rooted passion for farming and a keen business acumen. These experiences provided him with a firsthand perspective on the challenges faced by farmers and the vital role agriculture plays in the Canadian economy.

Beyond his professional accomplishments, Gourde finds joy and fulfillment in his personal life. He is married to Chantal Beaudoin, and together they have raised a beautiful family with five children. This grounding in family values and the responsibilities of parenthood further shapes Gourde's perspective, guiding his commitment to creating a better future for the next generation.

Jacques Gourde's biography intertwines the story of a dedicated farmer turned influential Member of Parliament. His unwavering commitment to representing the interests of his constituents, his expertise in agriculture, and his invaluable experiences have positioned him as a respected advocate for the people of Lévis—Lotbinière and an influential figure in Canadian politics.
