Marc Miller PC MP, a Canadian politician, was born on March 12, 1973. He gained prominence in the political arena when he was elected to represent the riding of Ville-Marie—Le Sud-Ouest—Île-des-Sœurs in the House of Commons during the 2015 election. Affiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada, he currently serves as the Minister of Crown Indigenous Relations in the Federal Cabinet, following the swearing-in of a new cabinet on October 26, 2021. Before entering politics, Miller pursued a career as a lawyer at Stikeman Elliott and served as an infantry commander in the Canadian Army Primary Reserve.

Early Life and Career
Marc Miller's background comprises a Nova Scotian father and an anglophone Montrealer mother. During the 1980s, he attended Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, where he coincided with Justin Trudeau, subsequently described as "a boyhood friend of Mr. Trudeau" and "one of [Trudeau's] oldest friends." Miller completed his bachelor's and master's degrees in political science at the Université de Montréal. In 2001, he graduated from McGill University Faculty of Law, obtaining common and civil law degrees. Prior to his political endeavors, Miller practiced law at Stikeman Elliott. Additionally, he served as an infantry commander in the Canadian Army Primary Reserve.

Federal Politics
Marc Miller played a significant role in organizing Justin Trudeau's initial political campaign in Papineau in 2007. He acted as an advisor and fundraising director during Trudeau's successful bid for the Liberal Party leadership in 2013. In the 2015 federal election, Miller secured his own seat in the House of Commons, representing the riding of Ville-Marie—Le Sud-Ouest—Île-des-Sœurs. Following the election, he assumed the position of chair of the Quebec Liberal Caucus of MPs.

On January 28, 2017, Miller was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. Notably, on June 1, 2017, he delivered the first-ever speech in the Mohawk language in the House of Commons. Miller embarked on learning the Mohawk language from Zoe Hopkins in the spirit of reconciliation and to demonstrate to non-French-speaking Liberal MPs, whom he had encouraged to study French during his previous role as the Quebec Liberal Caucus chair, that it was possible to learn a new language while fulfilling parliamentary duties.

Subsequently, on August 31, 2018, Miller transitioned to the role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations. Later, on November 20, 2019, he was sworn in as the Minister of Indigenous Services. Finally, on October 26, 2021, Miller assumed his current position as the Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations.

Personal Life
Marc Miller is married to Elin Sandberg, a former Swedish diplomat whom he met at a party while both were studying at the Université de Montréal. Together, they have three children: two boys named Marius and Lukas, and a girl named Eva. Despite being an anglophone, Miller is fluently bilingual in both official languages.
