Louis Plamondon, born on July 31, 1943, is a Canadian politician who has made significant contributions to the political landscape of Canada. He has represented the electoral district of Bécancour—Nicolet—Saurel (formerly known as Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour and Richelieu) in the House of Commons since 1984, making him the Dean of the House and the longest-serving current member of the House of Commons.

Plamondon's political career spans over four decades, marked by his remarkable success in consecutive federal elections. He has won his seat in twelve consecutive elections, initially as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party before becoming a founding member of the Bloc Québécois in 1990. Following his move to the Bloc Québécois, Plamondon has been reelected ten more times, solidifying his reputation as a resilient and dedicated representative.

In 2018, Plamondon, along with six other Bloc MPs, made the decision to resign from the Bloc's caucus and serve as an independent MP. Their departure was attributed to conflicts arising from the leadership style of Martine Ouellet. However, Plamondon later rejoined the Bloc Québécois caucus on September 17, 2018, reaffirming his commitment to the party and its objectives.

Early Life and Career:
Plamondon was born in Saint-Raymond-de-Portneuf, Quebec, and is the brother of the renowned lyricist Luc Plamondon. His educational background includes a teaching certificate from L'École normale Maurice L. Duplessis (1964), a Bachelor of Arts degree from Laval University (1968), and a B.A.An. from the University of Montreal (1976). Before entering politics, he worked as a math teacher and owned a restaurant. Plamondon's strong support for the "oui" side in Quebec's 1980 sovereignty referendum showcased his early involvement in advocating for Quebec's interests.

Member of Parliament:
Progressive Conservative MP:
Plamondon entered federal politics in 1984 when he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party. During this time, he served as a government backbencher under the leadership of Brian Mulroney, who led the party to a landslide majority victory. Plamondon quickly became known as a maverick within his party, consistently championing the interests of Quebec and advocating for its distinct identity.

Plamondon's progressive views on social issues and his support for official bilingualism aligned him with the socially liberal wing of the Progressive Conservative Party. He voted against the reintroduction of capital punishment in 1987 and opposed efforts to restrict abortion services. Plamondon also actively supported the rights of labor, promoting partnerships between governments and labor organizations and criticizing his own party's decisions when they undermined the interests of workers.

Bloc Québécois MP:
In 1990, following the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, Plamondon joined a group of Progressive Conservative and Liberal MPs from Quebec to form the Bloc Québécois. The Bloc initially operated as a loose alliance rather than a formal political party. Plamondon played a pivotal role in advocating for the creation of a strong party organization, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Bloc as a significant political force in Quebec.

Throughout his tenure as a Bloc Québécois MP, Plamondon continued to assert Quebec's interests and advocate for sovereignty. He was actively involved in various debates and discussions concerning language rights, constitutional reform, and the relationship between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Plamondon consistently supported the vision of an independent Quebec, and his dedication to
his cause earned him respect among his constituents and within the separatist movement in Quebec.

Independent MP and Return to the Bloc Québécois:
In 2018, Plamondon and six other Bloc Québécois MPs decided to leave the party's caucus and serve as independent MPs. Their departure was a result of disagreements with Martine Ouellet's leadership style and the direction she was taking the party. Plamondon, known for his principled stance and dedication to Quebec's interests, took this step to ensure that he could continue representing his constituents effectively.

However, Plamondon's time as an independent MP was short-lived. On September 17, 2018, he announced his return to the Bloc Québécois caucus, stating that the party had taken steps to address the issues that led to his departure. Plamondon's decision to rejoin the Bloc demonstrated his unwavering commitment to the party's objectives and his belief that it remained the best platform to advance Quebec's interests on the federal stage.

Longest-Serving Member of the House of Commons:
Louis Plamondon's political career is notable not only for his unwavering advocacy for Quebec's interests but also for his longevity as a parliamentarian. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, he has been elected twelve times consecutively, making him the longest-serving current member of the House of Commons. This achievement speaks to his dedication to public service and his ability to maintain the support of his constituents over several decades.

Legacy and Impact:
Throughout his career, Louis Plamondon has left a significant impact on Canadian politics, particularly in Quebec. His unwavering support for Quebec's interests, his advocacy for sovereignty, and his commitment to social issues have made him a respected figure within the province. Plamondon's principled approach to politics has earned him the trust of his constituents, who have consistently reelected him, and his contributions to the Bloc Québécois have helped solidify the party's position as a prominent force in Quebec politics.

As the Dean of the House of Commons, Plamondon has also played a role in mentoring and guiding younger MPs, sharing his experience and expertise. His extensive knowledge of parliamentary procedures and his commitment to democratic governance have made him a valuable resource within the House.

In conclusion, Louis Plamondon's political career has been defined by his unwavering advocacy for Quebec's interests and his dedication to the cause of sovereignty. As the longest-serving member of the House of Commons, he has made a lasting impact on Canadian politics, leaving a legacy of principled leadership and commitment to his constituents.
