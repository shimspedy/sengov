Patricia Lattanzio, a Canadian politician and lawyer of Italian heritage, has dedicated her career to public service and advocacy. Born and raised in Saint-Léonard, the same constituency she now represents in the House of Commons, Lattanzio has been a prominent figure in Canadian politics. As a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, she was elected to the House of Commons in the 2019 Canadian federal election, serving as the representative for the electoral district of Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel.

Lattanzio's political journey began earlier when she served on the Montreal City Council, securing her first seat through a by-election on November 15, 2015. Her commitment to her constituents earned her re-election in the 2017 municipal election. Prior to her city council tenure, Lattanzio held a position on the English Montreal School Board (EMSB) in 2007, where she championed educational initiatives. Recognizing her valuable contributions, she was re-elected in 2014 and also served as the chair of the Comité de gestion de la taxe scolaire de l’île de Montréal, overseeing the management of school tax in the Montreal region.

During her early years, Lattanzio actively participated in political campaigns, lending her support to Michel Bissonnet's mayoral campaign in Saint-Léonard in 1978. She continued her involvement by volunteering for subsequent electoral campaigns, assisting Michel Bissonnet, who became the Member of the National Assembly (MNA) for the Jeanne-Mance–Viger constituency.

Eager to expand her knowledge and contribute further to society, Lattanzio pursued higher education at McGill University. There, she excelled academically, earning a bachelor's degree with honors in political science. Building on her foundation, she went on to obtain a bachelor's degree in law from the University of Quebec at Montreal and a certificate in law from the University of Montreal. With her legal expertise, Lattanzio became a member of the Quebec bar in 1990 and has since practiced civil law for over 29 years.

Lattanzio's political career continued to flourish as she actively engaged with various educational institutions. In 2004, she joined the governing board of École Honoré-Mercier, her children's elementary school, displaying her commitment to fostering quality education. In 2007, she was elected as a school board commissioner for the Rivière-des-Prairies region at the English Montreal School Board, which is the largest English-language school board in Quebec. In 2014, she was elected once again, this time representing the riding of Saint-Léonard. Additionally, she served as the president of the Comité de gestion de la taxe scolaire de l’île de Montréal, an organization overseeing the collaborative efforts of all school boards in the Montreal region.

In 2015, Lattanzio's dedication to public service led her to be elected as city councillor for Saint-Léonard East in a by-election under the banner of Team Denis Coderre. Her commitment to her constituents and effective representation earned her re-election in the 2017 municipal election.

In 2019, Lattanzio pursued a federal political position as the Liberal candidate for the riding of Saint-Léonard—St-Michel. Her campaign resonated with the electorate, resulting in her victory with the largest majority in the province of Quebec. As a member of the House of Commons, she began her parliamentary duties in February 2020, serving on the Standing Committee on Official Languages and the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations. Later that year,

 she was re-appointed to the Official Languages Committee and was additionally appointed to the Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.

One of Lattanzio's notable achievements as a member of the Official Languages Committee was her role in advocating for the inclusion of questions in the 2021 census that would help identify official language minority communities. Alongside her fellow parliamentarians, she exerted pressure on Statistics Canada, leading to the successful inclusion of these questions in the census.

Fluently trilingual, Lattanzio is proficient in English, French, and Italian. Her linguistic abilities have undoubtedly contributed to her ability to connect with diverse communities and represent them effectively.

Throughout her career, Patricia Lattanzio has demonstrated a tireless commitment to public service, education, and the well-being of her constituents. Her legal expertise, multilingualism, and extensive political experience have enabled her to make a significant impact in the House of Commons and within her community.
