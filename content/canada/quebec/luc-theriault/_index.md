Luc Thériault MP, born on January 31, 1960, is a distinguished Canadian academic and politician who has made significant contributions to public service. Throughout his career, he has been associated with prominent political parties, leaving an indelible mark on both the provincial and federal political landscapes.

Hailing from Montreal, Thériault pursued his education at the Université du Québec à Montréal. In 1984, he obtained a bachelor's degree in philosophy, followed by a Masters in political philosophy in 1988. Eager to expand his knowledge and expertise, he went on to earn a DESS in bioethics from the Université de Montréal in 2002.

From 1985 to 2003, Thériault dedicated his time and knowledge to teaching philosophy at Collège de Maisonneuve. Simultaneously, he demonstrated his commitment to fostering athletic talent by coaching water polo from 1979 to 1988, nurturing the skills and character of aspiring athletes.

Thériault's passion for ethics and healthcare led him to serve as a member of the Ethics Committee of the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital and Jeanne-Le Ber nursing home from 2000 to 2003. Additionally, he actively participated in the governance of education, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Maisonneuve Cooperative School (Coopérative scolaire Maisonneuve) from 2001 to 2003.

In his pursuit of advancing the interests of his community, Thériault embraced his political calling. He took on the role of bureau chief for the Parti Québécois in Ville-Marie, Montreal from 1999 to 2003, demonstrating his organizational and leadership skills within the party structure. In recognition of his dedication and popularity, he ran as a candidate in the 2003 Quebec general election, triumphantly succeeding Gilles Labbé as the representative of the Masson electoral district in the National Assembly of Quebec.

Thériault's tenure as a member of the National Assembly from 2003 to 2007 allowed him to actively engage in the democratic process, championing the interests and concerns of his constituents. However, in the 2007 Quebec general election, he faced defeat at the hands of Ginette Grandmont, marking a temporary pause in his political career.

Undeterred by this setback, Thériault continued to serve his fellow citizens in different capacities. In 2015, he embarked on a new political journey and secured a seat in the Canadian House of Commons as a representative of Montcalm, representing the Bloc Québécois. His vast experience and dedication were quickly recognized, as he assumed the role of the Bloc Québécois House Leader from 2015 to 2017, effectively guiding and advocating for the party's positions.

During his tenure in the Canadian House of Commons, Thériault was appointed as the Bloc Québécois' representative on the Special Committee on Electoral Reform, further showcasing his commitment to democratic processes and fair representation.

However, Thériault's unwavering principles and conviction occasionally led him to make difficult decisions. Alongside six other Bloc MPs, he made the bold choice to resign from the Bloc's caucus on February 28, 2018. Citing conflicts with the leadership style of Martine Ouellet, he chose to sit as an independent Member of Parliament, valuing integrity and autonomy.

Yet, recognizing the importance of collective action and the shared vision of the Bloc Québécois, Thériault rejoined the party's caucus on September 17, 2018. This decision highlighted his commitment to the cause of Quebec sovereignty and his belief in the transformative power of a united front.

Luc Thériault's multifaceted journey intertwines academia

, ethical governance, and political advocacy. With his vast experience and profound understanding of the issues that shape society, he continues to be an instrumental figure in the pursuit of a better future for the people he represents and the country he serves.
