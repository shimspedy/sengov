Richard Lehoux, Member of Parliament (MP) for Beauce, Canada, was born in 1956. He has made significant contributions to the Canadian political landscape, representing the Conservative Party. However, his political journey began long before his tenure in Parliament.

Lehoux hails from a long-standing Beauce family, with roots dating back eight generations. The spirit of public service runs deep in his lineage, as evidenced by his great-grandfather's mayoralty in Saint-Elzear from 1898 to 1902. Additionally, Lehoux himself is a fourth-generation dairy farmer, highlighting his close connection to the region's agricultural heritage.

Lehoux's involvement in politics commenced at the local level. From 1998 to 2017, he served as the mayor of Saint-Elzear, a position that allowed him to actively contribute to the development of his community within the Chaudière-Appalaches region. Concurrently, he also held the esteemed role of reeve of the Nouvelle-Beauce Regional County Municipality, showcasing his ability to govern effectively and represent the interests of the broader region.

Recognizing his exceptional leadership qualities, Lehoux was invited to join the Fédération québécoise des municipalités (FQM) in 2001, a provincial organization that brings together municipalities across Quebec. He dedicated his efforts to the FQM for an impressive 16 years, actively participating in its activities and initiatives. Within the FQM, Lehoux served as vice president from 2010 to 2014 and briefly assumed the role of interim president in 2012. His commitment and strategic acumen eventually led to his election as president of the FQM in 2014, a position he held until 2017. Moreover, when the FQM established the Mutuelle des municipalités du Québec (MMQ) in 2003, Lehoux became its vice president. His dedication and valuable insights culminated in his election as MMQ president, a position he occupied from 2017 to 2018.

After retiring from municipal politics in 2017, Lehoux returned to his dairy farm. However, his passion for public service drew him back into the political realm. In November 2018, he embarked on a new chapter by becoming the Conservative Party candidate for the Beauce riding in the 2019 Canadian federal election. Lehoux gained substantial support, including the endorsement of party leader Andrew Scheer, further solidifying his credibility and dedication to the party's values.

The 2019 election proved to be a turning point for Lehoux's political career. He emerged victorious, securing a seat in Parliament and unseating the incumbent Maxime Bernier, who had formerly represented the Conservatives in Beauce but resigned to establish the libertarian-right People's Party of Canada (PPC). Lehoux's resounding victory demonstrated his ability to connect with constituents and effectively represent their interests. In the subsequent 2021 election, he once again earned the trust and support of the people of Beauce, securing his re-election to Parliament.

Richard Lehoux's biography is a testament to his commitment to public service, his deep roots in the Beauce region, and his ability to effect positive change at both the municipal and federal levels. As an influential Member of Parliament, he continues to champion the values and aspirations of his constituents while actively shaping Canada's political landscape.
