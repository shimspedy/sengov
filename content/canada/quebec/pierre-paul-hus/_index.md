Pierre Paul-Hus is a prominent Canadian politician known for his contributions to the House of Commons of Canada. Born and raised in Canada, Paul-Hus embarked on a remarkable journey that led him to become a respected representative of the riding of Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles.

Paul-Hus earned his degree in political science from Laval University, where he honed his understanding of governance and public affairs. In addition to his academic pursuits, he established himself as a successful entrepreneur, founding the prestigious PRESTIGE Media Group. Moreover, he played a significant role in the world of wine, serving as the vice president of Sélections Mondiales des Vins Canada, the largest wine competition in North America, for an impressive 11 years.

Prior to his political career, Paul-Hus made significant contributions to the Canadian military. As a military officer in the Reserve, he underwent rigorous training at the Canadian Army Command and Staff College in Kingston, Ontario, and the Ecole Militaire in Paris, where he also shared his knowledge as an instructor. Upon completing high school in 1987, he enlisted in the Régiment de la Chaudière, a reserve unit of the Canadian Armed Forces. During his 22 years of service, Paul-Hus participated in two operational missions. The first took him to Goose Bay, Labrador, under the auspices of NATO, while the second involved a deployment to Cyprus as part of the United Nations peacekeeping efforts. His dedication and commitment to his military duties were evident, and he retired in 2009 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

Driven by a passion for public service, Paul-Hus transitioned into politics and began making his mark in the Conservative Party. In 2011, he ran as a candidate in Louis-Hébert, where he finished in a commendable third place. Undeterred by this outcome, he persisted and decided to contest the 2015 election in the riding of Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles. Through his hard work and dedication, Paul-Hus emerged victorious, unseating the incumbent, Anne-Marie Day.

Within the House of Commons, Paul-Hus assumed several key roles, demonstrating his leadership abilities and commitment to serving his constituents. He currently serves as the Official Opposition Shadow Minister for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, leveraging his expertise to contribute to important policy discussions in these areas. Furthermore, he holds the position of Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, actively shaping legislation and initiatives that ensure the safety and well-being of Canadians. Additionally, Paul-Hus serves as the Vice-Chairman of the Defense and Security Committee of the NATO Parliamentary Association, further cementing his dedication to international cooperation and security.

Pierre Paul-Hus's life journey exemplifies a tireless pursuit of excellence, whether through his military service, entrepreneurial endeavors, or political career. His unwavering dedication to public service and his ability to make a meaningful impact on the lives of Canadians have earned him respect and admiration in both his constituency and the political arena as a whole.
