Gregory Cristophe Fergus PC MP, born on May 31, 1969, is a Canadian Liberal politician known for his dedicated service to his constituents. He currently represents the riding of Hull—Aylmer in the House of Commons of Canada, having been elected in the 2015 federal election.

Born into a family with roots in the British protectorate of Montserrat, Fergus has always embraced his multicultural heritage. His educational journey began at public English elementary schools, Westpark and Sunnydale, before he moved on to Lindsay Place High School. However, due to a teachers' strike that disrupted his education, his parents made the decision to enroll him in Selwyn House School, a private boys' school. It was during his time there, from Grade 9 to 11, that he formed friendships with future entrepreneurs Vincenzo Guzzo, Mark Pathy, and Michael Penner, the latter of whom would go on to serve as chairman of Hydro-Québec.

Fergus went on to pursue higher education, attending Marianopolis College, where he further honed his academic skills. He later earned two bachelor's degrees, one in social science from the University of Ottawa and another in international relations from Carleton University. These academic achievements equipped him with a strong foundation for his future endeavors.

During his time as president of the Young Liberals of Canada from 1994 to 1996, Fergus gained recognition for his support of same-sex marriage, boldly advocating for its acceptance within the Liberal Party. Following his university studies, he began his professional career working for prominent Liberal cabinet ministers Pierre Pettigrew and Jim Peterson. His commitment and expertise did not go unnoticed, and in 2007, he was appointed the national director of the Liberal Party by Stéphane Dion.

In the 2015 federal election, Fergus was selected as the Liberal candidate for the historically Liberal riding of Hull—Aylmer, which had been won by the New Democratic Party in the previous election. The campaign was not without its challenges, as Fergus faced accusations from NDP incumbent Nycole Turmel, who claimed that his team had spread false rumors about her health. Fergus vehemently denied these allegations. Despite the controversy, Fergus emerged victorious, securing over 11,000 votes. This substantial margin of victory surprised many, as the race was expected to be closely contested between the New Democratic Party and the Liberals.

Gregory Cristophe Fergus's tireless dedication to his constituents and his unwavering commitment to the Liberal Party have positioned him as a respected and influential figure in Canadian politics. Through his continuous efforts, he strives to create positive change and ensure a brighter future for all Canadians.
