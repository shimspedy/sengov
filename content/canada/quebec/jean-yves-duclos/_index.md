Jean-Yves Duclos PC MP FRSC, born in 1965, is a Canadian economist and politician who currently serves as the Minister of Health in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government since 2021. He is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada and has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Québec since 2015.

Duclos began his career by attending the University of Alberta, where he obtained an undergraduate degree in economics. He further pursued his academic journey at the London School of Economics, completing graduate and doctoral studies in economics. In 1992, he presented his doctoral thesis titled "Progressivity, equity and the take-up of state benefits, with application to the 1985 British tax and benefit system". This academic achievement showcased his expertise in the field of economics. Duclos was recognized for his contributions to the academic community and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2014.

Before entering the political arena, Duclos held prominent positions in academia. He served as the head of the economics department at Université Laval, a prestigious institution in Canada. Additionally, he was the president-elect of the Canadian Economics Association, demonstrating his leadership and commitment to advancing the field of economics.

In the 2015 general election, Duclos successfully ran for the riding of Québec, becoming the first Liberal Party member to represent the area since Gilles Lamontagne in 1984. His victory solidified his position as a key representative for the constituents of Québec. Subsequently, he was appointed as Minister of Families, Children and Social Development in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Cabinet. In the 2019 general election, Duclos was reelected and assumed the role of President of the Treasury Board, where he played a crucial role in managing Canada's finances.

On October 26, 2021, Duclos was entrusted with the portfolio of Minister of Health, highlighting the government's confidence in his abilities to oversee the nation's healthcare system and address public health concerns. In this role, he continues to contribute his expertise to shape policies and initiatives aimed at promoting the well-being of Canadians.

Throughout his career, Jean-Yves Duclos has combined his academic background in economics with his passion for public service. His dedication to his constituents and his valuable contributions to the academic and political spheres have established him as a respected figure in Canadian politics.
