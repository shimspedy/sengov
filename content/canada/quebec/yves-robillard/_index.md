Yves Robillard, Member of Parliament (MP), was born in 1942 in Canada. He embarked on a political career, driven by a passion for serving his constituents and contributing to the development of his nation. In the 2015 Canadian federal election, Yves was elected to represent the riding of Marc-Aur√®le-Fortin in the esteemed House of Commons of Canada, a pivotal moment that marked the beginning of his legislative journey.

Throughout his tenure, Yves Robillard has actively participated in shaping policies and making impactful decisions. His dedication to public service led him to serve on two influential committees, namely the Standing Committee on National Defence and the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities. Yves's invaluable experience and exceptional abilities have garnered recognition, often leading to his appointment for official representations on the international stage.

However, on December 22, 2021, a setback occurred in Yves Robillard's political career. He was removed from the Standing Committee on National Defence due to a controversy surrounding his involvement in non-essential travel outside of Canada. Despite the advisory discouraging such activities, Yves had chosen to proceed with his travels, leading to this consequential action being taken against him. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding ethical standards and adhering to the guidelines set forth in the pursuit of public office.
