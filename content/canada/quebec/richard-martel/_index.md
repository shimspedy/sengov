Richard Martel MP, born on March 23, 1961, is a Canadian politician and former ice hockey coach. Known for his dedication to both sports and public service, Martel has made a significant impact in the world of hockey and politics.

Martel's coaching career began in 1991 when he assumed the role of assistant coach under Jos Canale in Chicoutimi. He proved his worth as a capable and knowledgeable coach, earning the respect of his peers and players. During his tenure as an assistant coach, Martel displayed a deep understanding of the game and a talent for guiding and motivating his team.

In 1993, Martel took a leap forward in his coaching career and became a head coach in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). Over the next eighteen years, he dedicated himself to shaping the future of young hockey players and teams within the league. Martel's exceptional coaching skills were recognized by his peers, resulting in him being awarded the prestigious Ron Lapointe Trophy as the QMJHL coach of the year not once, but twice.

On February 28, 2010, Martel achieved a remarkable milestone in the QMJHL. During a game where he led the Chicoutimi Saguenéens, his team emerged victorious with a 3–1 score against the Baie-Comeau Drakkar. This victory marked Martel's 570th win as a QMJHL coach, surpassing the previous record held by Guy Chouinard. His achievement solidified his place in the history of the league as the most successful coach ever.

Beyond his coaching career, Martel's passion for making a difference in his community led him to pursue a career in politics. In a by-election held on June 18, 2018, he successfully secured a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. Martel proudly represents the electoral district of Chicoutimi—Le Fjord as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada.

Combining his love for hockey and his commitment to public service, Richard Martel MP has left an indelible mark in both arenas. His remarkable coaching career, marked by numerous accolades and a record-breaking achievement, serves as a testament to his dedication, expertise, and leadership. Today, Martel continues to make a positive impact on the lives of his constituents, bringing the same passion and determination to his role as a member of the Canadian Parliament.
