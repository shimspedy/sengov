Alexandre Boulerice MP, born on June 18, 1973, is a Canadian politician renowned for his dedicated service to the people of Canada. He has been a member of the New Democratic Party (NDP) and a representative of the Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie riding in the House of Commons of Canada since the 2011 election. Recognized for his exceptional leadership qualities, Boulerice currently holds the esteemed positions of the NDP's Quebec lieutenant and ethics critic.

Boulerice's notable political career began when he was appointed as the Deputy Leader of the New Democratic Party on March 11, 2019, by the party leader, Jagmeet Singh. Notably, after the 2019 federal election, Boulerice became the sole NDP Member of Parliament from Quebec. Furthermore, since the 2021 federal election, he has been the only NDP MP from any province east of Ontario, showcasing his influence and prominence within the party.

Before embarking on his political journey, Boulerice had a diverse range of experiences that shaped his character and fueled his passion for public service. At the age of 15, he started working as a lifeguard for the municipality and eventually became a pool manager. Boulerice pursued higher education, studying sociology at the Université de Montréal and later earning a master's degree in political science from McGill University.

During his formative years, Boulerice demonstrated a strong commitment to community engagement and workers' rights. He worked as a TV journalist for LCN and TVA while actively participating in his local union as the vice-president of local 687 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). Additionally, Boulerice contributed to the Union des travailleurs et travailleuses accidentés de Montréal (UTTAM), a community group dedicated to assisting injured workers. Later, he became a communications consultant for CUPE, further honing his skills in advocating for workers' rights and social justice.

Boulerice's journey into federal politics began in the late 1990s when he became actively involved in the New Democratic Party. He initially ran as a candidate in the 2008 federal election, finishing third with 16.26 percent of the vote. Undeterred by this result, Boulerice continued his dedication to the NDP and served as the vice president of communications for the party's Quebec section under the presidency of Françoise Boivin.

A defining moment in Boulerice's political career occurred during the May 2, 2011, federal election, commonly known as the "Orange Crush." The NDP achieved unprecedented success, securing 103 seats in the House of Commons, with 59 of those seats won in Quebec. Boulerice emerged victorious in his riding with an impressive 50.8 percent of the vote, defeating the Bloc Québécois incumbent Bernard Bigras. His triumph in Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie marked the first time the NDP had surpassed third place in the riding's history.

Throughout his tenure, Boulerice has taken on various responsibilities within the NDP. He was appointed as the opposition critic for the Treasury Board of Canada on May 26, 2011. In April 2012, he assumed the role of Labour critic and later became the deputy Ethics and Access to Information critic. Following the 2015 federal election, where the NDP experienced a decline in seat count, Boulerice was appointed as the party's Quebec lieutenant and held the positions of critic for Ethics and deputy critic for Democratic Reform in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. He also served as one of two New Democrats on the Special Committee on Electoral Reform.

Throughout his career, Boulerice has consistently shown his dedication

 to advocating for progressive policies and championing the rights of workers and marginalized communities. In fall 2011, he tabled Bill C-307, a private member's bill aimed at protecting the rights of pregnant and lactating women in the workplace. Despite its rejection in May 2012, Boulerice's efforts demonstrated his commitment to ensuring fair and inclusive labor practices.

Notably, Boulerice has also been a vocal critic of decisions that negatively impact the Canadian public. In response to Canada Post's plan to end door-to-door mail delivery in 2013, which would have resulted in significant job losses, he launched a petition and collaborated with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers to raise awareness and rally support against the cuts.

While Boulerice's political career has been marked by his commitment to serving the people of Canada, he has also faced controversy. In 2007, he expressed critical views on Canada's participation in the First World War and voiced opposition to the celebration of the Battle of Vimy Ridge. These comments sparked debate and drew both support and criticism from various quarters.

Throughout his tenure, Alexandre Boulerice has demonstrated his dedication to public service, advocating for workers' rights, social justice, and progressive policies. His leadership within the NDP and his unwavering commitment to his constituents have solidified his position as a respected figure in Canadian politics.
