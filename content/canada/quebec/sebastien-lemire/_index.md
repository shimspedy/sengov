Sébastien Lemire, a Canadian politician, has made his mark in the political arena as a Member of Parliament. He achieved this feat through his successful election to the House of Commons of Canada during the 2019 general elections. Representing the constituency of Abitibi—Témiscamingue, he proudly serves as a member of the Bloc Québécois, a political party dedicated to advancing the interests of Quebec.

During his time in office, Sébastien Lemire found himself at the center of a notable incident that unfolded on April 21, 2021. In a display of accountability and remorse, Lemire openly acknowledged his actions involving a Zoom call where he captured a photograph of a naked fellow Member of Parliament, Will Amos. In an act of humility and responsibility, he offered a heartfelt apology to Amos in the esteemed setting of the House of Commons.
