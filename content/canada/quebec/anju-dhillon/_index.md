Anju Dhillon, a Canadian Liberal politician, was born in 1979 and has emerged as a notable figure in the Canadian political landscape. Her journey began in Montreal, where she was born and raised. From a young age, she exhibited a strong passion for politics and actively engaged in volunteer work for Paul Martin's campaigns, even starting at the tender age of 13.

Dhillon's commitment to public service and her deep involvement with the Liberal Party continued to grow over the years. For a decade, she served as the vice-president (female) for youth in the federal liberal riding association in LaSalle-Émard, demonstrating her dedication to empowering young voices within the party. Building on this experience, she later assumed the role of vice-president (female) within the same association, further cementing her commitment to promoting inclusivity and gender equality in politics.

Her academic pursuits took her to Concordia University, where she pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. With a firm foundation in political theory and governance, Dhillon decided to pursue a career in law at Université de Montréal. Her determination led her to make history as the first Canadian Sikh to practice law in Quebec, a significant achievement that broke barriers and paved the way for future generations.

In 2015, Dhillon's political career reached new heights when she successfully ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Dorval—Lachine—LaSalle in the federal election. This historic victory made her the first individual of South Asian descent to be elected from the province of Quebec, marking a significant milestone for representation and diversity in Canadian politics.

Throughout her career, Anju Dhillon has remained dedicated to serving her constituents and advocating for their interests on a national level. Her experiences as a member of a visible minority and her commitment to equality and justice continue to shape her political agenda. As a Canadian Sikh woman, she exemplifies the power of diversity in driving positive change and creating a more inclusive society for all.
