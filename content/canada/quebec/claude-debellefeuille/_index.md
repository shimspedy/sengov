Claude DeBellefeuille MP, born on December 13, 1963, is a distinguished Canadian politician who has been serving as the member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Salaberry—Suroît in Quebec since the 2019 federal election. Known for her unwavering dedication to her constituents and her strong advocacy for Quebec's interests, she is a prominent member of the Bloc Québécois (BQ), a party focused on promoting Quebec's sovereignty within Canada. Prior to her current position, she previously held the role of MP for Beauharnois—Salaberry from 2006 to 2011.

Hailing from Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Quebec, DeBellefeuille began her professional career as a social worker before embarking on a path in politics. Her passion for public service and desire to effect positive change led her to run for office. In the 2006 federal election, she contested the riding of Beauharnois—Salaberry, where she emerged victorious after triumphing over Alain Boire in the nomination race. Her resounding victory in the general election solidified her place as an influential political figure. Demonstrating her commitment to serving her constituents, DeBellefeuille was reelected in 2008 with an even greater margin of victory compared to her previous win.

Recognized for her exceptional leadership skills, DeBellefeuille was appointed as the chief Bloc Québécois Whip in June 2010, replacing Michel Guimond. Prior to assuming this crucial role, she had served as the Deputy Whip. Her tenure as the Whip showcased her ability to effectively manage the party's parliamentary activities and maintain cohesion among its members. However, in the 2011 federal election, DeBellefeuille faced a setback due to the wave of support for the New Democratic Party (NDP), commonly known as the Orange Wave. As a result, she lost her seat to Anne Minh-Thu Quach of the NDP, marking a temporary hiatus in her political career.

Undeterred by this defeat, DeBellefeuille remained committed to public service and the pursuit of her political goals. In 2015, she contested the Salaberry—Suroît riding, once again encountering Anne Minh-Thu Quach as her opponent. Unfortunately, DeBellefeuille did not emerge victorious in this election either. However, she persevered and eventually succeeded Quach as the MP for Salaberry—Suroît in the 2019 federal election, further cementing her status as a resilient and determined political figure.

On June 17, 2020, DeBellefeuille demonstrated her strong leadership by speaking out as the party whip following an incident involving fellow Bloc Québécois MP Alain Therrien. Therrien had been labeled a 'racist' by New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh after he voted against a motion addressing systemic racism and discrimination in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Standing up for her colleague and the values she held dear, DeBellefeuille voiced her support and commitment to the Bloc Québécois.

The following day, on June 18, 2020, DeBellefeuille called for Singh to be barred from speaking in Parliament due to his previous day's 'outburst.' Despite her efforts, her request was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, DeBellefeuille's actions demonstrated her firm resolve and unwavering dedication to her party's principles.

Claude DeBellefeuille MP's political career has been marked by resilience, determination, and a strong commitment to serving the people

 of Quebec. As a prominent member of the Bloc Québécois, she continues to advocate for the interests of her constituents and strive for the realization of Quebec's sovereignty within the Canadian political landscape. Her unwavering spirit and leadership have solidified her position as a respected and influential figure in Canadian politics.
