Dominique Vien, a Canadian politician, was born on February 10, 1967. Her political career spans several years, during which she served as the Member of the National Assembly for the electoral district of Bellechasse from 2003 to 2007. Although she faced defeat in the 2007 election against Jean Domingue of the Action démocratique du Québec, she made a successful comeback and was re-elected in the same district in 2008. Vien aligned herself with the Quebec Liberal Party and held the positions of Delegate Minister for Health and Social Services, as well as Minister for Government Services.

Vien hails from Lévis, Quebec, and pursued her higher education at Université Laval, where she earned a bachelor's degree in communications in 1992. Additionally, she enrolled at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières in 2001 to further her studies in training, animation, and leadership.[1] Prior to entering politics, Vien worked as a journalist, anchor, and radio host at a station in Lac-Etchemin from 1992 to 2003. Furthermore, she served as a journalist and news anchor at Radio-Canada's CBV-FM in Quebec City between 1999 and 2001.

In the 2021 Canadian federal election, Vien achieved yet another milestone in her political career by securing a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. She emerged victorious in the riding of Bellechasse—Les Etchemins—Lévis as a representative of the Conservative Party of Canada.
