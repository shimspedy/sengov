Harnirjodh "George" Chahal MP is a Canadian politician with an extensive background in local and federal politics. He currently serves as the Member of Parliament for Calgary Skyview under the Liberal Party of Canada.

Chahal began his political career in 2017 as a Councillor for Ward 5 on the Calgary City Council, where he served for four years before transitioning to federal politics. In July 2021, he announced his nomination as the Liberal Party candidate for Calgary Skyview in the 2021 Canadian federal election.

On September 20, 2021, Chahal emerged victorious in the election, becoming the only Liberal candidate to secure a seat in Calgary and only the seventh Liberal in the city's history to represent a Calgary riding.

However, shortly after his win, Chahal found himself embroiled in a controversy over a doorbell camera video that appeared to show him removing a flyer for his Conservative opponent, Jag Sahota, from a constituent's door on the eve of the election. The Calgary Police's Anti-Corruption Unit launched an investigation into the incident, which sparked a heated debate between Chahal's campaign and the homeowner.

Chahal's campaign argued that he had removed the flyer because it contained incorrect polling location information. However, the homeowner claimed that it was Chahal's flyer that had the wrong information, and that Sahota's flyer matched the official information provided by Elections Canada.

In January 2022, Chahal accepted and paid a $500 administrative monetary penalty assessed by the Commissioner of Canada Elections for his role in the flyer incident. Chahal owned up to his actions, acknowledging that it was a mistake on his part, and expressed his willingness to move past the controversy and continue his work as a dedicated public servant.
