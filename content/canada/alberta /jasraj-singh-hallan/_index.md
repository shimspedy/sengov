Jasraj Singh Hallan is a Canadian politician and businessman who was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2019 federal election to represent the riding of Calgary Forest Lawn. He was born in Dubai to Indian parents, but immigrated to Canada as a child and spent his formative years in Calgary. Hallan's upbringing was marked by economic disadvantage and he grew up as an at-risk youth in the Northeast Calgary area. Nevertheless, he graduated from Lester Pearson High School and later earned an accounting diploma from SAIT. Hallan also has a certified Master Builder designation and is the owner of a successful home building business that has built many homes for families in Calgary.

Hallan's interest in politics began when he ran in the 2019 Alberta general election for the United Conservative Party, vying for the riding of Calgary-McCall. He lost to Irfan Sabir. Following the death of Member of Parliament for Calgary Forest Lawn, Deepak Obhrai, the Conservative Party of Canada opened a nomination race for the Conservative candidacy for Calgary Forest Lawn in the 2019 Canadian Federal Election. Hallan contested the nomination against Obhrai's son, Aman Obhrai, Calgary City Councillor Andre Chabot, and Amrit Rai Nannan and emerged as the winner. In the subsequent federal election, Hallan won the riding of Calgary Forest Lawn with almost 60% of the popular vote.

In Parliament, Hallan has voted in support of Bill C-233, which seeks to amend the Criminal Code to make it an indictable or summary offence for a medical practitioner to perform an abortion solely on the grounds of the child's genetic sex. Outside of politics, Hallan is dedicated to giving back to his community and helping disadvantaged youth and immigrants and refugees to Canada. He and his wife still live in Northeast Calgary and have two daughters. In 2019, Hallan sponsored a refugee family from Afghanistan.
