Matthew James Arthur Jeneroux is a Canadian politician from the Conservative Party of Canada. He has been elected to the House of Commons of Canada since the 2015 federal election and represents the electoral district of Edmonton Riverbend. In addition to his political career, Jeneroux is the Founder of the Hi Dad Foundation, which aims to raise awareness about the importance of men's mental health.

Jeneroux was born and raised in Edmonton and Sherwood Park, Alberta. He holds a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Alberta and previously worked for Health Canada before entering politics.

Jeneroux was first elected to the provincial assembly in the 2012 provincial election, representing the electoral district of Edmonton-South West. During his time in the legislature, he introduced a private member's bill called Compassionate Care Leave Legislation, which provides a leave of absence for an employee to take care of a terminally ill family member. He also chaired several committees and was involved in initiatives related to youth, education, and childcare. Jeneroux was defeated in the 2015 provincial election.

In federal politics, Jeneroux has been named "Best Constituency MP in Canada" by The Hill Times Publication and currently serves as the Shadow Minister for Supply Chains. He has also served as the Shadow Minister for Health, Infrastructure, Communities & Urban Affairs, Innovation, Science and Economic Development, and Science. Jeneroux has been a member of several parliamentary committees, including the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, and the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.

Jeneroux's private member bill, An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code (bereavement leave) (Bill C-220), was adopted with all-party support during the 43rd Canadian Parliament. This bill extends bereavement leave from 5 to 10 days and entitles employees already on compassionate care leave to also claim bereavement leave.

In recognition of his contributions, Jeneroux has received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal and the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal. He is a father of three children, Molly, Lily, and Hugh.
