Damien C. Kurek MP is a Canadian politician and farmer who currently represents the riding of Battle River—Crowfoot in the House of Commons of Canada. He was born on November 28, 1989, and grew up on a farm outside Consort, Alberta.

Kurek's interest in politics began at a young age, and at fifteen, he had a ten-minute meeting with then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his local Member of Parliament, Hon. Kevin Sorenson. This experience solidified his passion for politics.

Kurek obtained his High School Diploma from Consort Public School in 2008 and later obtained an associate diploma in Biblical Studies from Eston College in 2010. In 2015, he earned a bachelor's degree in political science and communications from Trinity Western University.

Before entering politics, Kurek worked as a farmer and in the oil and gas sector. He also worked for Hon. Kevin Sorenson in his constituency office in Camrose, Alberta, and served under Sorenson in Ottawa in 2015 and in the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly while Brad Wall was Premier of Saskatchewan.

Kurek joined his local Electoral District Association in 2016 and served on it until 2019 when he decided to run as the Conservative candidate for Battle River—Crowfoot. He was elected in the 2019 Canadian federal election and was re-elected in the 2021 election.

Kurek is married to his wife Danielle and has three sons named Matthew, Emerson, and Winston. He currently resides in Alberta's Special Areas and continues to work on his family's farm while carrying out his duties as a Member of Parliament.

Since his election, Kurek has held several roles within the Conservative Party of Canada. He is a member of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development and the Conservative Shadow Cabinet as the Critic for Rural Economic Development. Kurek is committed to serving his constituents and advocating for the needs of rural Canadians in the House of Commons.
