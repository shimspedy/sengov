Garnett Genuis is a Canadian politician, born on January 23, 1987, who has served as the Member of Parliament for the riding of Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan in Alberta since 2015. He grew up in Strathcona County and attended Carleton University in Ottawa, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Public Affairs and Policy Management in 2010. Genuis also obtained a Master's degree in Public Policy from the London School of Economics in 2011.

In the 2012 Alberta general election, Genuis ran as the Wildrose MLA candidate for Sherwood Park, but lost to the Progressive Conservative candidate. In 2014, he announced his intention to seek the Conservative nomination for the 2015 Canadian federal election in the newly formed riding of Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan. He won the nomination and went on to win the federal election, becoming a Member of Parliament.

Genuis was appointed as the Deputy Critic for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in November 2015 and was named Maclean's Parliamentarian of the Year in November 2017, making him the youngest recipient of the award to date. He was re-elected to the 43rd Canadian Parliament in 2019 and was given the role of Shadow Minister for Multiculturalism by then-leader of the Conservative Party, Andrew Scheer. He was re-elected to the 44th Canadian Parliament in 2021 with 57.5% of the popular vote in his constituency.

Genuis has been a strong supporter of the Tibet cause and has met with the Dalai Lama to discuss human rights and religious freedom. He has also introduced private member motion M-57, calling on the Canadian government to support bystander intervention training to combat sexual harassment and violence, hate crimes, and other forms of criminal activity. Genuis has supported bills aimed at protecting people from the exploitative practices of organ harvesting and advancing international human rights. He is currently a committee member of FAAE (Foreign Affairs and International Development) & CIMM (Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration).
