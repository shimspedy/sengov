John S. L. Williamson MP, born on January 30, 1970, is a Canadian politician who has made significant contributions to public service. He currently serves as a Member of Parliament for the riding of New Brunswick Southwest in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the Conservative Party of Canada since 2019. Prior to his current tenure, he represented the same riding from 2011 until his defeat in the 2015 election, after which he was re-elected in 2019.

Education has played a vital role in Williamson's journey. He completed his high school education at Fredericton High School before pursuing a degree in economics and political science at McGill University. Eager to expand his knowledge, he went on to earn a master's degree in economic history from the prestigious London School of Economics.

Beyond his academic achievements, Williamson also possesses a distinguished lineage. As an heraldic heir, he is entitled to inherit a coat of arms, a symbol of his family's heritage and tradition.

Williamson's early career was marked by his involvement in various influential institutions. He began as an editorial writer for the National Post, quickly becoming a founding member of the newspaper's editorial board from 1998 to 2001. In September 2002, he joined the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, where he played a pivotal role in establishing the organization's Toronto office as the provincial director for Ontario. Recognizing his abilities and dedication, he was promoted to federal director in January 2004 and served as the organization's spokesperson in Ottawa until September 2008.

In 2009, Williamson's skills and expertise caught the attention of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who appointed him as the director of communications in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). From this position, he oversaw government-wide communications, utilizing his strategic vision to effectively convey key messages to the public. In 2010, he made the decision to step down from his role in the PMO in order to prepare for his own political campaign. Dimitri Soudas succeeded him as director of communications.

Entering the political arena, Williamson campaigned for the 41st Parliament and was introduced to readers of the St. Croix Courier in April 2011. As an outspoken Member of Parliament, he has not hesitated to voice his views, even when they diverge from his own party's policies. For instance, he expressed concerns about bill C-30, which sparked controversy regarding online anonymity.

One of Williamson's notable contributions has been his advocacy for the construction of an oil pipeline from Alberta to Saint John, New Brunswick. This pipeline would transport undistilled petroleum products to be refined at the J. D. Irving plant, bringing economic benefits to the region.

Transparency in government has been a consistent focus for Williamson. He has repeatedly called for the creation of a federal "Sunshine" list, which would disclose the salaries of public servants earning over $100,000 per year. This aligns with his support for Brent Rathgeber's Private Member's Bill C-461, aimed at promoting disclosure and transparency in the CBC and public service.

Throughout his career, Williamson has demonstrated a commitment to justice and fairness. In April 2012, he spoke out against what he believed to be unjust targeting by the Toronto Police in the case of a restaurant owner charged with assault. Drawing parallels to a previous incident involving David Chen, Williamson voiced his outrage and concern, advocating for fairness in the criminal justice system.

Williamson's dedication to public service extends to the promotion of individual freedoms within the House of Commons. In March 2013, he joined several backbench Conservative MPs in supporting MP Mark Warawa's Point of Privilege, advocating for increased freedom of speech for individual Members of Parliament during proceedings.

In addition to his political endeavors, Williamson has been an active participant in public discourse. He has expressed his opinion on various issues, including the Senate vote in 2014 and a private member's bill focused on disclosing the salaries of federal employees.

Although Williamson faced defeat in the 2015 election, he persevered and successfully regained his seat in the 2019 Federal election, reflecting his resilience and dedication to serving his constituents. As a member of Parliament, he continues to contribute to the political landscape and champion the values he believes in.
