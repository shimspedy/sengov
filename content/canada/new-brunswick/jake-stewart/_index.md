Jake Daniel Stewart, born on March 10, 1978, is a Canadian politician renowned for his dedicated service to the people of New Brunswick. His political journey began with his election to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the provincial election of 2010, where he represented the esteemed electoral district of Southwest Miramichi. As a member of the Progressive Conservatives, Stewart swiftly became a respected figure within the political landscape.

Prior to his provincial political career, Stewart embarked on a path of public service by venturing into municipal politics. In 2008, he courageously ran for the office of councillor in his hometown of Blackville, displaying a strong commitment to making a positive impact at the local level.

The pivotal moment arrived in 2010 when Stewart made the decision to enter provincial politics. In the electoral battle against the incumbent Liberal MLA Rick Brewer, who held the significant position of Minister of Human Resources, Stewart emerged victorious, securing the trust and support of the electorate. This triumph not only marked the beginning of an influential political career but also showcased Stewart's ability to connect with constituents and address their concerns effectively.

Throughout his tenure in the Legislative Assembly, Stewart served on various esteemed committees, including the Standing Committees on Education, Private Bills, Procedure, and Public Accounts. Notably, he chaired the prestigious Standing Committee on Legislative Officers, demonstrating his exceptional leadership skills and commitment to upholding democratic principles.

Furthermore, Stewart's remarkable dedication to education and fostering positive learning and working environments led to his appointment by Jody Carr, the then Minister of Education, to the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Positive Learning and Working Environment (Anti-Bullying). In this role, he played a significant part in shaping policies and initiatives to combat bullying and promote inclusivity within educational institutions.

Stewart's unwavering commitment to public service earned him reelection in 2014, reaffirming the trust bestowed upon him by the constituents of Southwest Miramichi. Within the Progressive Conservative caucus, he assumed the role of opposition critic for Energy and Mines, as well as Aboriginal Affairs, displaying his keen interest in critical issues that shape the province's future. Additionally, Stewart's membership in the Standing Committee on Economic Policy further showcased his dedication to fostering a robust and prosperous economy for all.

In 2016, driven by his ambition and desire to make a broader impact, Stewart entered the Progressive Conservative leadership race. This endeavor exemplified his unwavering commitment to public service and his aspirations to lead with vision and integrity.

On August 17, 2021, Stewart made the difficult decision to resign from the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick, leaving behind a legacy of dedication and accomplishments. However, his journey in politics was far from over. September 20, 2021 marked a significant milestone as he was elected the Conservative Member of Parliament for the prestigious riding of Miramichiâ€”Grand Lake. This new role opened doors for Stewart to continue serving the people and championing their interests at the federal level, building upon the valuable experiences gained during his time in the provincial legislature.

Throughout his career, Jake Daniel Stewart has exhibited an unwavering commitment to public service, demonstrating exceptional leadership, and a deep-rooted passion for advocating on behalf of the people he represents.
