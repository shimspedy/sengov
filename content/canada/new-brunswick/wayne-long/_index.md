Wayne Long, born on April 13, 1963, is a distinguished Canadian politician known for his dedicated service to the people of Canada. He embarked on his political career by winning the election for the riding of Saint John—Rothesay, representing the Liberal Party, in the 2015 federal election.

Before entering the world of politics, Wayne Long had a successful and extensive business career. He excelled as a seafood executive, bringing valuable expertise to the table. He served as a product manager for Stolt Sea Farm Inc. and later assumed the role of President at Scotiaview Seafood Inc., a privately held company where he led a team of two individuals, according to Manta.ca. Wayne's leadership abilities were further recognized when he became the President of the Saint John Sea Dogs, the city's CHL franchise, for the 2005-2006 season. Under his guidance, the team achieved the remarkable feat of winning the Memorial Cup in 2011. Wayne's exceptional contributions to the franchise earned him the esteemed John Horman Trophy, an accolade bestowed upon the league's top executive.

Wayne Long's political career gained attention due to his outspoken support for the Energy East oil pipeline project. While the Liberal Party maintained a neutral stance on the matter, Wayne was vocal about his unwavering support for the project. He pledged to actively lobby within the Liberal caucus to rally behind the Energy East pipeline, distinguishing himself as a passionate advocate.

In September 2017, Wayne Long made headlines by expressing his opposition to tax changes for private corporations proposed by Liberal Finance Minister Bill Morneau. His courageous stand demonstrated his commitment to scrutinizing policies and representing the best interests of the people he served. Notably, on October 4, 2017, Wayne stood apart as the sole Liberal MP to vote in favor of a Conservative Party opposition motion to extend the consultation period, displaying his independent voice and dedication to democratic processes.

In February 2021, Wayne Long, alongside Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, displayed his unwavering commitment to the welfare of Canadians by voting in favor of an NDP-proposed motion. This motion aimed to initiate the development of a national pharmacare system, a vital step toward ensuring accessible and affordable healthcare for all. The bill, spearheaded by Peter Julian, aimed to establish the necessary conditions for federal financial contributions to provincial drug insurance plans. Subsequently, the Liberal Party, as part of their confidence and supply agreement with the NDP following the 2021 federal election, pledged to work towards a "universal national pharmacare program".

Wayne Long MP continues to serve as a dedicated representative of the people of Saint John—Rothesay. His business acumen, leadership abilities, and unwavering dedication to the well-being of Canadians have made him a respected figure in Canadian politics.
