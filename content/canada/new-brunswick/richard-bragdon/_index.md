Richard Bragdon MP, born in either 1975 or 1976, is a prominent Canadian politician known for his dedicated service in the House of Commons of Canada. He successfully secured the electoral mandate to represent the Tobique—Mactaquac riding as a member of the Conservative Party during the 2019 Canadian federal election.

Throughout his tenure in the 43rd Canadian Parliament, Bragdon's exceptional legislative efforts were evident. One of his notable achievements was the successful passage of his private member bill, titled "An Act to establish a framework to reduce recidivism" (Bill C-228). This legislation compelled the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to develop a comprehensive federal framework aimed at effectively reducing recidivism within one year of its adoption.

In June 2021, Bragdon demonstrated his stance on a significant societal issue when he voted against Bill C-6. This bill aimed to outlaw conversion therapy in Canada, a controversial practice that seeks to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. By opposing the bill, Bragdon showcased his differing perspective on the matter.

Richard Bragdon continues to serve as a dedicated representative for his constituents, working tirelessly to address crucial issues and contribute to the legislative landscape of Canada.
