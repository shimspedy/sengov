Niki Christina Ashton MP, born on September 9, 1982, is a Canadian politician known for her dedication to public service. She represents the New Democratic Party (NDP) as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Churchill—Keewatinook Aski electoral district in Manitoba, Canada. Ashton's political journey began when she was first elected in the 2008 federal election, and she has since emerged as a prominent figure in Canadian politics.

Born in Thompson, Manitoba, Ashton hails from a family deeply involved in public affairs. Her father, Steve Ashton, served as a Manitoba provincial NDP cabinet minister, while her mother, Hariklia Dimitrakopoulou, contributed to the rich tapestry of her heritage with Greek roots. Growing up, Niki Ashton shared her childhood with a younger brother named Alexander. She attended École Riverside School and R. D. Parker Collegiate before embarking on an enriching educational journey.

Passionate about global political dynamics, Ashton pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in Global Political Economy from the University of Manitoba. Furthering her academic pursuits, she obtained a Master of Arts in International Affairs from Carleton University, specializing in human rights and social justice at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs. Ashton's thirst for knowledge and cross-cultural experiences led her to attend the Li Po Chun United World College in Hong Kong.

Ashton's commitment to public service has been evident throughout her career. She has served as an instructor at the University College of the North, sharing her expertise and shaping the minds of future leaders. Her dedication extended beyond academia, as she coordinated and promoted volunteering at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where she provided invaluable assistance to the Canadian and Chinese Olympic teams with her fluency in Greek.

In 2005, Ashton's political journey took a significant turn when she contested and won the NDP nomination against incumbent Member of Parliament Bev Desjarlais. Her victory was fueled in part by her stance on same-sex marriage, a critical issue that Desjarlais had broken party ranks to vote against. The victory paved the way for Ashton to run as the NDP candidate in the Churchill riding during the 2006 Canadian federal election, where she faced Desjarlais as an independent candidate. Despite her strong campaign advocating for federal funding for the University College of the North and promoting northern development agreements, the NDP vote split, leading to a victory for the Liberal Party candidate, Tina Keeper.

Undeterred by her defeat, Ashton bounced back and triumphed in the 2008 federal election, regaining the Churchill riding for the NDP by defeating Keeper. Her tenacity and commitment to her constituents were evident in her subsequent electoral successes, including her re-election in the 2019 and 2021 federal elections.

Recognized for her leadership qualities and dedication to public service, Ashton announced her intention to run for the leadership of the federal NDP on March 7, 2017. Her bid marked a significant milestone, as she became the third-place contender in the October 1, 2017 election, securing 17.4% of the vote and narrowly missing the runner-up position. Jagmeet Singh emerged as the elected leader on the first ballot.

Throughout her political career, Ashton has held various important roles and responsibilities. In the 40th Parliament of Canada, she served as the Chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Status of Women, effectively championing women's rights. Additionally, Ashton has served as the NDP Post-Secondary and Youth critic, the Rural and Community Development critic, and, from 2012 to 2014, the Status of Women Critic. Recognizing her expertise and commitment, she was appointed as the Aboriginal Affairs Critic in Canada's Official Opposition on January 23, 2015. Ashton's contributions extended to the 42nd Canadian Parliament, where she held the position of NDP critic for Jobs, Employment, and Workforce Development.

In her political campaigns, Ashton has been driven by a progressive agenda aimed at building a fairer society. During the 2017 NDP leadership election, she advocated for creating and maintaining good-paying jobs for young people and working Canadians while addressing the urgent issue of climate change. Another key focus was her commitment to providing tuition-free post-secondary education, striving to ensure equal access to education for all. Ashton has been vocal about combating wealth inequality, protecting value-added jobs, and scrutinizing foreign ownership and trade deals that may undermine Canada's interests.

Ashton's political engagement is not confined to domestic issues alone; she is also an active participant in foreign policy matters. In the midst of the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, Ashton expressed her opposition to economic or military coups and emphasized the need to support Venezuela's sovereignty. Similarly, she has been a critic of the extradition case against Meng Wanzhou, sponsoring a petition in the House of Commons for Meng's release and advocating for an independent foreign policy on China.

Beyond politics, Ashton is a multi-linguist, proficient in English, French, Greek, and Spanish. She has also embarked on language lessons in Cree, Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Mandarin, further reflecting her commitment to embracing diverse cultures and fostering understanding.

Ashton's personal life has been interwoven with her political journey. In 2011, she married Ryan Barker, though they later separated in 2015 and divorced in 2017. In May 2017, Ashton announced her pregnancy, and later that year, she gave birth to twin boys, defying any notions that motherhood would hinder her commitment to public service. Determined to carry on her work, she persevered with her leadership campaign, standing as a testament to the strength and resilience of Canadian women.

Niki Christina Ashton MP continues to serve as an influential figure in Canadian politics, leaving an indelible mark through her unwavering dedication to social justice, gender equality, and progressive policies aimed at building a better future for all Canadians.
