Terry Duguid MP, born in either 1954 or 1955, is a Canadian politician known for his dedicated service as the member of Parliament (MP) for Winnipeg South since 2015. Over the course of his career, he has displayed a strong commitment to public service, having campaigned and held elected positions at the municipal, provincial, and federal levels. Duguid's early foray into politics began when he served as a city councillor in Winnipeg from 1989 to 1995.

Born into a family with a rich sporting heritage, Duguid is the son of the renowned professional curling athlete, Don Duguid. He pursued his academic aspirations and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology, followed by a Master's Degree in Environmental Science. Duguid's passion for the environment led him to engage in various eco-business pursuits within the Winnipeg area. Notably, he held the position of president of Sustainable Development International and served as chairman of the Manitoba Clean Environment Commission. Moreover, he made significant contributions as president and CEO of the Gateway North Marketing Agency, where he played a vital role in safeguarding the survival of the Port of Churchill and the Hudson Bay Rail Line. Duguid's commitment to public health is evident through his founding presidency of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases, a not-for-profit organization established in response to the SARS outbreak, with the aim of supporting and enhancing the mandate of the Public Health Agency of Canada.

Before entering politics, Duguid dedicated himself to environmental activism, becoming a prominent figure in the field. During the 1980s, he served as the executive director of the Manitoba Liberal Party, where he contributed to shaping the party's vision and policies.

From 1989 to 1995, Duguid served as a member of the Winnipeg City Council, representing the wards of Miles MacDonell, which consisted of 20,000 constituents, and North Kildonan, which had 40,000 constituents. During his tenure, he held the position of chairman of the Public Works Committee, where he played a pivotal role in the creation of Winnipeg's blue box recycling program. In 1995, Duguid stepped down as councillor to pursue the mayoral position in Winnipeg, but the incumbent mayor, Susan Thompson, was re-elected.

Following his tenure in municipal politics, Duguid embarked on a successful career in the not-for-profit sector. From 1995 to 1997, he served as the president and CEO of Gateway North International, focusing on securing the future of the rail line leading to the Port of Churchill. His exceptional leadership facilitated the transfer of both the rail line and the port, which had a combined value of $100 million, to a new owner. Subsequently, from 1997 to 2000, Duguid held the position of president at Sustainable Development International, a consulting firm specializing in conservation and international management. Additionally, he served as the chairman of Manitoba's Clean Environment Commission from 2000 to 2004, responsible for conducting public hearings on major development projects, including forestry and hydro-electric development. In 2004, Duguid became the founding president of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases in Winnipeg, a role he fulfilled until 2009. His involvement in the establishment of ICID and the Public Health Agency of Canada stemmed from his participation in a task force focused on improving Canada's response to infectious disease outbreaks, particularly in light of the SARS epidemic in Toronto.

Duguid's political aspirations led him to participate in federal elections, where he sought to represent the interests of the people. In the 2004 and 2006 Canadian federal elections, he ran as the Liberal candidate for the north Winnipeg riding of Kildonanâ€”

St. Paul, narrowly losing the first election and facing defeat in the second, as the Conservatives formed a minority government. In the 2011 Canadian federal election, Duguid contested the riding of Winnipeg South as the Liberal candidate, finishing in second place behind the incumbent Conservative, Rod Bruinooge.

It was in the 2015 federal election that Duguid experienced a breakthrough, emerging victorious as the Liberal candidate for Winnipeg South. The election marked a significant shift in Canadian politics, with the Liberals replacing the Conservative majority government. In the aftermath of the election, Duguid was appointed as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Families, Children, and Social Development, Jean-Yves Duclos. On January 28, 2017, he assumed the role of Parliamentary Secretary for the Status of Women under Maryam Monsef. Additionally, Duguid served as a member of the Canada-China Legislative Association, where he held the position of vice-chair and participated in a two-week tour of China alongside colleagues from various political parties. He also contributed his expertise as a member and vice-chair of the Canada-Africa Parliamentary Association.

In November 2017, Catherine McKenna, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, appointed Duguid as the government lead for the Lake Winnipeg clean-up efforts. In this capacity, he oversaw the allocation of $25.7 million in federal spending through the Lake Winnipeg Basin Program, aimed at addressing toxic algae blooms. Duguid continues to play an active role in environmental matters and, as of December 3, 2021, serves as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change.

Throughout his career, Terry Duguid MP has demonstrated a steadfast dedication to public service, striving to make a positive impact on his community and the nation as a whole. His extensive background in environmental advocacy and his commitment to public health and women's issues have solidified his reputation as a devoted representative for Winnipeg South.
