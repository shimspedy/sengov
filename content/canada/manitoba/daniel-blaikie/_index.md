Daniel Blaikie, a Canadian politician, has been serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Elmwood—Transcona since October 19, 2015. He is affiliated with the New Democratic Party (NDP) and was elected to the House of Commons in the 2015 federal election.

Blaikie was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and grew up in the northeastern suburb of Transcona. He pursued his education at the University of Winnipeg, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in history and philosophy. He furthered his academic journey at Concordia University, earning a master's degree in philosophy. In addition to his intellectual pursuits, Blaikie also trained as an electrician, demonstrating his versatility and practical skills. His political lineage can be traced through his family; his father, Bill Blaikie, served as an NDP MP, and his sister, Rebecca Blaikie, held positions as the NDP's president and treasurer.

Early on, Blaikie engaged in community work, immersing himself in various initiatives in Transcona, Winnipeg, and Manitoba. He actively contributed to the Transcona Historical Museum as a board member, displaying his commitment to preserving local heritage. As an MP, he maintains his interest and involvement with the museum, now serving as an honorary board member. Blaikie is also an associate member of the Transcona Legion, Branch #7, a longstanding institution in the community. He commemorated the Transcona Legion's 90th anniversary as a Member of Parliament, utilizing his allotted time for Statements by Members in the House of Commons to highlight the legion's history and significance.

Prior to his political career, Blaikie served on the Apprenticeship and Certification Board of Manitoba, playing a role in coordinating the province's apprenticeship and certification system. This experience provided him with valuable insights into labor and vocational training.

During his campaign for the 2015 election, Blaikie received support from the Winnipeg Labour Council, on whose executive he had previously served. This collaborative effort between Blaikie and the council contributed to his successful election as an MP.

In the political arena, Blaikie secured the NDP nomination for his father's former riding, setting the stage for the 2015 election. In a tightly contested race, he emerged victorious, defeating the Conservative incumbent Lawrence Toet by a margin of just 61 votes. Notably, Blaikie was the only non-Liberal candidate elected from a Winnipeg riding that year. In the subsequent 2019 rematch against Toet, Blaikie achieved a much more substantial victory, surpassing his opponent by over 3,500 votes.

Within the 42nd Parliament, Blaikie assumes the role of Vice-Chair for the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. He is also an active member of several parliamentary associations, including the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association, Canada-Ireland Interparliamentary Group, Canada-United Kingdom Inter-Parliamentary Association, Canada-United States Inter-Parliamentary Group, and Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA). Furthermore, Blaikie participates in the Canadian Delegations to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA), NATO Parliamentary Association (NATO PA), and ParlAmericas. These engagements showcase his dedication to fostering international relationships and addressing global issues through parliamentary cooperation.
