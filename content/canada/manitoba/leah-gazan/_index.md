Leah Gazan MP, born on April 8, 1972, is a prominent Canadian politician known for her dedicated service as the representative of the Winnipeg Centre riding in the House of Commons of Canada. Her election in the 2019 Canadian federal election marked the beginning of an impactful journey in the realm of Canadian politics.

Gazan's early life was shaped by her diverse heritage and a strong commitment to social justice. Born in Thompson, Manitoba, she was raised by her parents Albert and Marjorie Gazan. Her mother's side of the family carries Lakota-Chinese roots, while her father's lineage is Jewish. Albert Gazan, her father, is a Holocaust survivor from the Netherlands, having been born in The Hague, South Holland, in 1938. Both of Leah's parents actively engaged in political organizing for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the predecessor party of the NDP.

Before venturing into politics, Gazan made significant contributions as a lecturer at the Faculty of Education in the University of Winnipeg. Her passion for social justice also led her to serve as the president of the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg. Additionally, she actively participated in the Idle No More movement, advocating for Indigenous rights, and played a pivotal role in championing the passage of Bill C-262 in the House of Commons. Gazan represented the province of Manitoba in the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, where she worked tirelessly to shed light on the injustices faced by Indigenous Canadian adoptive children.

Gazan's political career has been deeply influenced by her socialist beliefs, which she inherited from her parents. In 2019, she secured the NDP nomination for Winnipeg Centre, triumphing over former Manitoba Attorney General Andrew Swan. Subsequently, in the general election, Gazan defeated the incumbent Liberal candidate Robert-Falcon Ouellette, another Indigenous candidate, reclaiming the Winnipeg Centre seat for the NDP.

During her tenure in the 43rd Canadian Parliament, Gazan assumed the role of Critic for Families, Children, and Social Development in the NDP's shadow Cabinet, a position she was appointed to by NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. She demonstrated her commitment to tackling pressing issues by introducing a private member's bill, Bill C-323, titled "An Act respecting a Climate Emergency Action Framework." The bill aimed to mandate the development and implementation of a framework aligned with the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Regrettably, on March 24, 2021, the bill was defeated, with MPs from the Liberal and Conservative parties voting against it.

In August 2020, Gazan made headlines by presenting Motion 46 in the House of Commons, advocating for the conversion of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, into a permanent basic income program. Her tireless advocacy for social and economic equality was further exemplified when she voiced her support for Universal Basic Income (UBI) in the House of Commons in 2021.

One of Gazan's notable achievements was her successful motion in the House of Commons to declare the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency. The motion not only passed unanimously but also called for the establishment of a new system to issue alerts for missing individuals. Through this significant accomplishment, Gazan furthered her commitment to addressing the systemic issues faced by Indigenous communities in Canada.

Leah Gazan MP's biography is a testament to her unwavering dedication to social justice, her tireless efforts to amplify the voices of marginalized communities, and her firm belief in creating a more equitable and inclusive Canada.

 As she continues to serve her constituents and advocate for progressive change, Leah Gazan's impact on Canadian politics is bound to leave a lasting legacy.
