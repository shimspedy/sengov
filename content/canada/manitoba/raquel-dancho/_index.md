Raquel Dancho MP, born on April 16, 1990, is a Canadian politician hailing from Kildonan—St. Paul, Manitoba. She has made her mark as a dedicated member of Parliament (MP) representing her constituents. As a staunch member of the Conservative Party, Dancho emerged victorious in the 2019 Canadian federal election, securing her seat in Parliament and solidifying her commitment to public service.

Born and raised in the close-knit farming community of Beauséjour, Manitoba, Dancho's early years were shaped by the values of hard work and community. She pursued her higher education at McGill University, initially enrolling in the business program before realizing her true passion lay in the realm of political science. With her academic journey complete, Dancho returned to her home province of Manitoba, where she initially sought a seat in the Legislative Assembly. Although this endeavor proved unsuccessful, she gained valuable experience by working alongside several ministers in Brian Pallister's government, further fueling her dedication to public service.

Dancho's political career gained momentum as she vied for the district of Wolseley in the 2016 provincial election, representing the Progressive Conservatives. While her bid fell short, she remained undeterred in her pursuit of making a positive impact on the political landscape. Her unwavering dedication and commitment to her constituents caught the attention of Andrew Scheer, leader of the Official Opposition, who appointed her to the Shadow Cabinet following the Conservatives' defeat in the 2019 federal election. In this esteemed role, Dancho served as the Shadow Minister for Diversity, Inclusion, and Youth, utilizing her platform to champion these critical causes.

Throughout her political journey, Dancho has demonstrated unwavering support for her party and its leaders. She openly endorsed Erin O'Toole in the 2020 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, standing firmly behind his vision for the party and the country. Recognizing her expertise and passion, O'Toole appointed Dancho as the Shadow Minister for Public Safety and vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security (SECU) in November 2021. Her role within the Shadow Cabinet was further solidified when interim Conservative leader Candice Bergen reappointed her as the Shadow Minister for Public Safety on February 25, 2022, in the 44th Canadian Parliament.

Beyond her official duties, Dancho has proven herself to be a vocal advocate for individual freedoms and civil liberties. During the Freedom Convoy 2022 protests, she took a firm stance against what she perceived as draconian measures implemented by the Prime Minister, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding fundamental freedoms. Her unwavering dedication to the well-being of millions of Canadians affected by these measures has led her to call on the government to provide viable solutions and effective leadership.

Raquel Dancho MP continues to serve as a passionate and dedicated member of Parliament, utilizing her platform to represent the interests and aspirations of the people she serves. Her commitment to public service, coupled with her unwavering principles, positions her as a prominent figure in Canadian politics, one who strives to make a positive and lasting impact on her constituents and the nation as a whole.
