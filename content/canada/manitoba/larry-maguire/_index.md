Larry Maguire MP, born on June 1, 1949, is a prominent politician and farmer activist hailing from Manitoba, Canada. He has made significant contributions to both the agricultural sector and the political landscape of his country. Maguire has been associated with the Conservative Party of Canada throughout his political career, holding positions in various committees and making noteworthy legislative contributions.

Maguire's journey began as the owner and operator of Maguire Farms Limited in Elgin, where he worked alongside his former spouse, Beryl, from 1975 to 2001. Their farmland was eventually sold to neighboring farmers. Maguire's dedication and achievements in farming earned him recognition, such as being named mid-Canada's Outstanding Young Farmer in 1986 and receiving a Certificate of Merit from the Manitoba Agricultural and Food Sciences Grads Association in 1990. During his tenure, he served as the Western Manitoba Representative on the Canadian Wheat Board Advisory Committee from 1987 to 1994 and held the position of chairman for the Agricultural Diversification Alliance (ADA). Additionally, he served as a public governor of the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, advocating for changes to the federal Crow Equity Fund.

From 1995 to 1999, Maguire served as the president of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association. In this role, he actively opposed the Canadian Wheat Board's single-desk marketing policy, advocating for market competition in wheat and barley. His outspoken stance on the matter led him to campaign for re-election as a Wheat Board advisor in 1994, running on an anti-monopoly platform. Despite his efforts, Maguire was defeated by a pro-monopoly candidate, Bill Nicholson. Undeterred, he continued to support the anti-monopoly position in the 1997 CWB referendum on barley sales, although the majority of farmers voted in favor of maintaining the single-desk marketing system.

Maguire's passion for agriculture extended beyond his own farm, as he actively participated in shaping agricultural policies and initiatives. In 1998, he served on a council evaluating proposals for the Agri-food Research and Development Initiative, a joint project by the federal and provincial governments. Additionally, he endorsed anti-monopoly candidates during the Canadian Wheat Board's first-ever director election in the same year, though pro-monopoly candidates secured the majority of positions.

Maguire's political career took flight when he won the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada nomination for Brandonâ€”Souris in the 1993 federal election, defeating provincial cabinet minister Jim McCrae. However, despite the historical significance of the riding as a safe seat for the Progressive Conservatives, Maguire finished third behind the Reform candidate and the Liberal Party of Canada's Glen McKinnon. Undeterred, he planned to seek the PC nomination again for the 1997 election but ultimately withdrew in favor of Brandon Mayor Rick Borotsik.

In August 2013, Maguire's fortunes changed when Merv Tweed, Borotsik's successor, resigned from the House of Commons. Inspired by this development, Maguire announced his intention to seek the nomination for the Conservative Party of Canada in the electoral district. He was successful in securing the nomination and went on to win the by-election on November 25, 2013, earning a seat in the House of Commons of Canada.

Maguire's political journey continued as he was re-elected in the 2015 and 2019 Canadian federal elections, demonstrating his popularity and the trust bestowed upon him by his constituents. In the lead-up to the 2019 election, Maguire's commitment to environmental causes earned him the endorsement of GreenPAC, a non-profit, non-partisan organization that supports environmental leaders from various political backgrounds. His advocacy for water and wetland protection, as

 well as his success in securing funding for water management and wetland restoration projects, played a pivotal role in securing this endorsement.

During the 43rd Canadian Parliament, Maguire achieved a significant legislative victory with the adoption of his Private Member's Bill, Bill C-208. Introduced on February 19, 2020, this bill, titled "An Act to amend the Income Tax Act (transfer of small business or family farm or fishing corporation)," applies the capital gains tax and its exemptions to inter-generational transfers of small businesses, family farms, and family fishing corporations. The aim is to ensure that these transfers are taxed at the same rate as when selling to a third party, making it more financially advantageous for owners to transfer their operations to family members from a taxation perspective.

In addition to his federal political career, Maguire also sought the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba nomination for Arthur-Virden in April 1999. Though he initially lost to rival candidate Gary Nestibo, a new nomination meeting was held due to allegations of irregularities, and Maguire emerged victorious with support from third-place candidate Grant Fotheringham. Subsequently, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1999 provincial election. Throughout his tenure as a member of the opposition, Maguire served as the Progressive Conservative critic for the environment and played a significant role in advocating for improvements to the provincial Water Rights Act.

Maguire's contributions to Manitoba's political landscape expanded further as he represented the Progressive Conservatives in an all-party delegation to Ottawa, advocating for increased funding for farmers. He also served on an all-party provincial committee on agriculture. Although there were rumors of his potential campaign to succeed Gary Filmon as Progressive Conservative Party leader in 2000, this did not come to fruition. Instead, he took on various roles within the party, such as rural development critic, finance critic, and deputy leader under Hugh McFadyen's leadership.

Throughout his political career, Maguire demonstrated a commitment to serving his constituents and fighting for the causes he believed in. His dedication to agriculture, environmental protection, and tax reform has made him a respected figure in both federal and provincial politics. With his accomplishments and continued efforts, Larry Maguire has left an indelible mark on Canadian politics and the agricultural community.
