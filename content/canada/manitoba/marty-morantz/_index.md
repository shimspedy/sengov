Martin B. "Marty" Morantz MP, born on April 7, 1962, is a distinguished Canadian lawyer, businessperson, philanthropist, and politician hailing from Winnipeg. Since the 2019 Canadian Federal Election, he has been an esteemed Member of Parliament representing the Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia—Headingley riding in the House of Commons of Canada. Running as the Conservative candidate, Morantz unseated the Liberal incumbent Doug Eyolfson in the riding, earning the trust and support of the constituents.

Prior to his service in the House of Commons, Morantz held the position of city councillor for the Charleswood-Tuxedo-Whyte Ridge ward on Winnipeg City Council from 2014 to 2018, following his victory in the 2014 Winnipeg municipal election. During his tenure on City Council, Morantz demonstrated strong leadership and chaired both the Finance and Infrastructure committees. Additionally, he served on the Executive Policy Committee, contributing his expertise and insight to the betterment of the community.

In 2011, Morantz secured the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba nomination in River Heights. He contested the 2011 Manitoba general election against the incumbent and then leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party, Jon Gerrard. While Morantz garnered over eight percentage points more votes than the party's candidate in the 2007 provincial election, he placed second to Gerrard.

Morantz's educational journey began with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Studies from the esteemed University of Manitoba. Subsequently, he pursued a law degree at Osgoode Hall, York University in Toronto. Afterward, Morantz established a remarkable legal career as a partner at a prominent downtown Winnipeg law firm, amassing over two decades of experience.

In 2009, Morantz assumed the role of president at Jernat Investments Ltd., a distinguished property investment and financial services firm primarily focused on multi-unit apartment buildings. His expertise and strategic acumen significantly contributed to the growth and success of the company.

Throughout his life, Morantz has been actively involved in various community groups, dedicating his time and energy to advocacies and causes close to his heart.

Within the parliamentary realm, Morantz has made notable contributions as a member of the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, as well as the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance. In 2020, he assumed the vital role of Conservative Shadow Minister for National Revenue, focusing his efforts on matters related to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

In September 2020, Morantz joined the esteemed Interparliamentary Task Force on Combatting Online Antisemitism, collaborating with elected officials from various countries around the world to address and combat online antisemitism, fostering unity and understanding.

Notably, in November 2020, Morantz presented Bill C-256, known as the Supporting Canadian Charities Act. This significant legislation proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act, aiming to provide a comparable tax treatment for privately held shares or real estate, similar to that afforded to public shares when donated to charitable organizations. Projected estimates indicate that this legislation could generate up to $200 million per year in donations. The bill has garnered extensive support from charitable organizations across Canada, highlighting Morantz's commitment to supporting and strengthening the charitable sector.

Through his multifaceted career as a lawyer, businessperson, philanthropist, and politician, Marty Morantz has made a lasting impact on his community and the nation at large.
