Daniel Vandal PC MP, born on April 18, 1960, is a Métis Canadian politician hailing from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He has had an extensive career in both municipal and federal politics, making significant contributions to his community and advocating for various causes.

Early Life and Career:
Daniel Vandal was born in Winnipeg to a Métis family on April 18, 1960. Growing up, his family identified as French Canadian, and it wasn't until later in life that he became aware of his Métis heritage. As a teenager, Vandal dropped out of high school and worked as a manual labourer. However, his life took a turn when he discovered boxing at the age of 15. He turned professional in 1978 and became the top-ranked Canadian middleweight in 1983. Vandal's boxing career instilled discipline and determination in him, and he credits the sport for positively shaping his life.

After his boxing career, Vandal became a youth worker at Winnipeg's Mamawiwichiitata Centre and pursued a degree in Social Work from the University of Manitoba. During the 1990s, he served as the vice-president of the Old St. Boniface Residents Association and actively campaigned against the construction of a stadium for the Winnipeg Goldeyes baseball team in Whittier Park.

City Council and Mayoral Campaign:
Vandal's political career began in 1995 when he was elected to the Winnipeg City Council, representing the St. Boniface Ward. He aligned himself with the left-leaning Winnipeg in the '90s (WIN) group, alongside councillors Glen Murray and Lillian Thomas. As a city councillor, Vandal advocated for social issues and opposed several initiatives put forth by Mayor Susan Thompson.

In 2004, Vandal ran for the position of Mayor of Winnipeg but came in second to Sam Katz. However, he briefly served as the acting mayor following Glen Murray's resignation. Vandal's tenure on the city council was marked by his involvement in various committees and his dedication to representing the interests of his constituents.

Member of Parliament and Federal Minister:
On October 19, 2015, Vandal was elected as the Member of Parliament for Saint Boniface—Saint Vital in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the Liberal Party of Canada. His election marked a transition from municipal to federal politics. He has since been reelected in subsequent elections, including in 2021.

In Justin Trudeau's cabinet, Vandal assumed the role of Federal Minister of Northern Affairs on November 20, 2019. He has also been named the Minister responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency and the Minister responsible for the Prairies Economic Development Agency of Canada, showcasing his commitment to regional development.

Throughout his political career, Vandal has been a staunch advocate for various causes, including addressing poverty among Winnipeg's Aboriginal community and promoting the development of St. Boniface as a vibrant French Quarter. He has worked to improve social services, combat crime, and support initiatives that benefit his constituents.

Daniel Vandal's journey from a professional boxer to a prominent politician highlights his perseverance, dedication, and commitment to public service. His accomplishments in municipal and federal politics reflect his passion for improving the lives of those he represents, making him a respected figure in Canadian politics.
