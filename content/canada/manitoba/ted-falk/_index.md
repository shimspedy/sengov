Theodore J. "Ted" Falk MP, born on May 23, 1960, is a Canadian politician renowned for his role as a Member of Parliament representing the electoral district of Provencher in the House of Commons of Canada. A dedicated member of the Conservative Party of Canada, Falk initially secured his position through a by-election on November 25, 2013, and has since remained a prominent figure in Canadian politics.

Before his venture into politics, Falk built a successful career as the owner of a construction and gravel-crushing company. Additionally, he demonstrated his commitment to the community by serving as the president of the volunteer board of the Steinbach Credit Union (SCU).

Falk's political journey commenced in 2013 when he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Provencher in a by-election, following the retirement of former cabinet minister Vic Toews, who had dedicated nearly 13 years to the area. Subsequently, Falk achieved re-election in the federal elections of 2015, 2019, and 2021, showcasing his ability to connect with constituents and secure their continued support.

Known for his fiscal and social conservatism, Falk often stands in contrast to his party's official positions. One notable example is his staunch anti-abortion stance, which he consistently upholds despite differing opinions within his party. In 2016, Falk found himself at odds with the organizers of the Steinbach Pride event. While initially citing a scheduling conflict with the Frog Follies festival in St-Pierre-Jolys, he declined the invitation to attend the Pride event due to his adherence to what he perceived as the "values of faith, family, and community."

During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, Falk expressed his opposition to mandatory vaccines and vaccine requirements for entry into businesses. He made controversial statements regarding the safety of Covid vaccines, falsely asserting that they posed more danger than the Delta variant. However, Falk later retracted these statements, acknowledging the importance and safety of vaccines for Canadians. Despite not disclosing his personal vaccine status, Falk complied with the vaccine mandate by attending House meetings virtually rather than entering Parliament in person.
