Michael McLeod MP, born on September 6, 1959, is a distinguished Canadian politician who currently holds the esteemed position of a Member of Parliament representing the Northwest Territories. With a strong commitment to public service, he was first elected during the 2015 Canadian federal election, successfully unseating Dennis Bevington, the incumbent New Democratic Party MP for the riding.

Hailing from Fort Providence, Northwest Territories, McLeod's political journey began early in his career. At the age of 22, he assumed the role of Mayor of Fort Providence, having been selected by the local Dene council for this important leadership position.

In pursuit of his passion for serving the community, McLeod contested his first election in the 1999 Northwest Territories general election. In a remarkable upset, he emerged victorious, defeating Speaker Samuel Gargan to secure the Deh Cho electoral district. Demonstrating his ability to connect with constituents, McLeod was re-elected in the 2003 Northwest Territories general election, in a closely contested race where he prevailed over challenger Michael Nadli by a narrow margin of only 13 votes.

Continuing his political trajectory, McLeod was returned by acclamation in the 2007 Northwest Territories general election. During his tenure, he held key positions in the government, serving as Minister of Transportation and Minister of Public Works and Services. However, McLeod faced a setback in the 2011 election, experiencing defeat at the hands of Michael Nadli.

Undeterred by his electoral loss, McLeod redirected his efforts towards contributing to the development of his community. He took on the role of Director of the Mackenzie River Environmental Impact Review Board, working diligently to protect the environment. Additionally, he collaborated with the territorial government to promote tourism in the South Slave region.

In 2015, McLeod embarked on a new political venture, seeking the Liberal Party of Canada nomination for the Northwest Territories riding in the upcoming federal election. In a competitive nomination process, he triumphed over Gail Cyr, following the withdrawal of another contender, Kieron Testart, who subsequently endorsed McLeod. This set the stage for the general election on October 19, 2015, where McLeod emerged victorious, defeating the New Democrat incumbent, Dennis Bevington, to claim the seat.

The support and trust garnered from his constituents led to McLeod's re-election in the 2019 federal election, cementing his status as a dedicated representative for the Northwest Territories.

It is worth noting that Michael McLeod MP comes from a family with a strong political background. His brother, Bob McLeod, served as a member of the legislature and held the position of Premier of the Northwest Territories from 2011 to 2019, further highlighting the family's commitment to public service and governance.mons demonstrates his enduring commitment to serving the people of Bonavista—Burin—Trinity and his unwavering dedication to advancing the welfare of all Canadians.
