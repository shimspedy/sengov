Robert Joseph Morrissey, born on November 18, 1954, is a Canadian politician who has made significant contributions to public service. Currently serving as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada, he represents the electoral district of Egmont and is affiliated with the Liberal Party.

Morrissey's political journey began in provincial politics, where he served as a representative for the electoral districts of 1st Prince from 1982 to 1996 and Tignish-DeBlois from 1996 to 2000 in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island. Throughout his tenure, he remained a steadfast member of the Liberal Party.

During his time in provincial politics, Morrissey achieved notable milestones. He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 1982 general election for 1st Prince and went on to secure re-election in subsequent elections, including 1986, 1989, and 1993. Following the redrawing of electoral districts, he successfully ran in the 1996 election in the new district of Tignish-DeBlois.

Morrissey's dedication to public service was further exemplified through his ministerial appointments. On May 2, 1986, he was appointed to the Executive Council of Prince Edward Island as Minister of Transportation and Public Works. He subsequently held the positions of Minister of Industry and Minister Responsible for the Prince Edward Island Development Agency in 1989. Notably, he was also entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the redevelopment of CFB Summerside and its surrounding community following the base closure by the federal government. On April 15, 1993, Morrissey assumed the role of Minister of Economic Development and Tourism and Minister Responsible for Enterprise PEI. In addition, he served as the chair of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. Although he did not seek re-election in the 2000 general election, Morrissey left a lasting impact on provincial politics.

Transitioning to federal politics, Morrissey's commitment to public service remained unwavering. In November 2007, he was nominated as the Liberal candidate for the Egmont district in the 2008 Canadian federal election. However, he withdrew his candidacy on August 5, 2008, choosing to explore opportunities in the private sector.

Undeterred by his temporary departure from politics, Morrissey's passion for public service propelled him back into the political arena. On November 22, 2014, he received the Liberal nomination for the Egmont district, setting the stage for the 2015 federal election. In a hard-fought campaign, Morrissey emerged victorious, triumphing over Conservative incumbent Gail Shea and New Democrat candidate Herb Dickieson on October 19, 2015.

Beyond his political career, Morrissey has a diverse background. Prior to entering politics in 1982, he worked in the fishery industry. Since 2000, he has served as a consultant specializing in corporate/government relations, fisheries, labor market, and community development. Moreover, he held prominent positions such as President of PFI Group, President of Global Food Technologies, and Director of Royal Star Investments.

Morrissey's involvement in community initiatives further highlights his commitment to improving the lives of others. He served as a trustee of the Unit 1 School Board and chaired the West Prince Community Advisory Board. Additionally, he held the position of vice-chair on the Parish Council of St. Simon and St. Jude. Before his political career, Morrissey organized the Tignish Irish Moss Festival. Since 2000, he has contributed his expertise as a board member of the Heart & Stroke Foundation of PEI, President and treasurer of the Tignish Seniors Home Care Co-op, and a member of the building and fundraising committees of the Credit Union Arena located in Tignish. Furthermore, he holds the position of Vice Chair of Tignish Special Needs Housing and serves on the Advisory Board to Holland College West Prince Campus.

Morrissey's personal life reflects his strong roots and values. He was born at the Western Hospital in Alberton, Prince Edward Island, to Bernard and Marie (n√©e O'Connor) Morrissey. Growing up in Seacow Pond near Tignish, Prince Edward Island, he embraced the Catholic faith. Currently, he resides in Seacow Pond, where he continues to serve his constituents with dedication and passion.
