Sean J. Casey is a Canadian politician hailing from Prince Edward Island, Canada. Born on May 16, 1963, Casey embarked on a remarkable political career that led him to become a Member of Parliament (MP) and make significant contributions to his community.

Casey's early years were marked by academic achievements and a drive for success. He was born in St. John's, Newfoundland, and pursued his education at St. Francis Xavier University and Dalhousie Law School. In 1989, he joined the prestigious firm Stewart McKelvey, where he eventually became a partner in 1993. His professional journey took an interesting turn when he assumed the role of President of the Paderno Group of Companies from 2003 to 2008. After this endeavor, Casey returned to Stewart McKelvey as the firm's managing partner until his decision to enter politics in 2011. During this time, he also served as the President of the Greater Charlottetown Area Chamber of Commerce from 2009 to 2010. Casey's commitment to his community extended beyond his professional life as he actively volunteered in soccer and minor hockey.

Casey's foray into politics began with his role as the President of the Prince Edward Island Liberal Party from 2003 to 2007. His tenure as president coincided with the party's victory in the 2007 election, and he decided not to seek reelection, having accomplished his objectives. However, when Shawn Murphy, a four-term incumbent, announced his retirement from politics, Casey saw an opportunity to contribute further. He stepped forward as a candidate for the Liberal Party's nomination in the Charlottetown riding. Casey's unwavering dedication and the absence of opponents secured his nomination, propelling him to the general election in 2011. With a commendable 40% of the vote, he emerged victorious and began his tenure as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Charlottetown. Casey's election victory was particularly notable as one of only two new Liberal MPs elected in the 2011 federal election.

Throughout his political career, Casey has held influential roles within the Liberal Party. During the 41st Parliament, he served as the party's Justice critic, advocating for fair and just policies. He was reelected in the 2015 election, continuing his commitment to public service. Subsequently, he secured reelection in 2019, solidifying his position as a respected representative of his constituents.

Within Parliament, Casey has assumed various responsibilities and played a vital role in shaping legislation. Notably, he served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coast Guard. In addition, he has held the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, as well as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Furthermore, Casey assumed the role of Chair of the Atlantic Liberal Caucus, fostering collaboration and representing the interests of the region.

Currently, Casey chairs the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities. Additionally, he contributes his expertise and insights as a member of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs. Through his involvement in these committees, Casey strives to address pressing issues and improve the well-being of individuals within Canada.

Sean J. Casey's journey from a successful legal career to a dedicated Member of Parliament showcases his commitment to public service and the betterment of his community. With his continued passion and efforts, he remains a trusted representative and advocate for his constituents in Prince Edward Island.
