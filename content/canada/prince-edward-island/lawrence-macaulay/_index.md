Lawrence A. MacAulay is a Canadian politician who has had a long and distinguished career in public service. Born on September 9, 1946, he has been representing the riding of Cardigan in Prince Edward Island in the House of Commons since 1988.

MacAulay's political journey took a significant turn on June 11, 1997, when he joined Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's cabinet as the Minister of Labour and Minister responsible for Prince Edward Island. A year later, in 1998, he assumed the role of Solicitor General of Canada. However, his time in the cabinet came to an end on October 21, 2002, when he resigned amid a conflict of interest inquiry.

Despite stepping down from the cabinet, MacAulay continued to serve as a dedicated Liberal backbench member of Parliament (MP) throughout the remaining years of the Liberal government under Prime Minister Chrétien. When the Conservative government, led by Stephen Harper, came into power in 2006, MacAulay remained an opposition member, diligently fulfilling his responsibilities as an MP. His commitment to public service extended to his role as the Official Opposition Critic for Seniors.

MacAulay achieved a significant milestone in his career on March 20, 2014, becoming the longest-serving MP in the history of Prince Edward Island, surpassing the previous record set by Angus MacLean. This accomplishment is a testament to his enduring dedication to the people he represents.

Another chapter in MacAulay's political journey opened on November 4, 2015, when he was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Later, on March 1, 2019, MacAulay's expertise and experience led to his appointment as the Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence after a cabinet shuffle by Prime Minister Trudeau.

Beyond his political career, MacAulay cherishes a fulfilling personal life in Prince Edward Island alongside his wife, Frances. Together, they have built a home and a sense of community in their beloved province.

However, MacAulay's career has not been without controversy. In December 2022, he faced scrutiny in parliament when other MPs confronted him regarding multiple reports of Veterans Affairs Canada offering medical assistance in dying (MAID) to veterans seeking medical care. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his strong disapproval, describing the incidents as "absolutely unacceptable."

Throughout his decades-long career, Lawrence A. MacAulay has demonstrated unwavering commitment to public service and has left a lasting impact on the political landscape of Canada, particularly in Prince Edward Island.
