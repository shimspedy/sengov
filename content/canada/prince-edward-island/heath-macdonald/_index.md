MacDonald's political career took off when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island in the 2015 provincial election, representing the electoral district of Cornwall-Meadowbank as a member of the Liberal Party. His strong leadership and unwavering dedication to his constituents earned him great respect within the political arena.

His innovative strategies and vision played a crucial role in promoting the province's economic growth and enhancing its tourism sector.

Recognizing MacDonald's exceptional skills and accomplishments, he was appointed Minister of Finance in a cabinet shuffle on 10 January 2018. This position allowed him to demonstrate his financial acumen and contribute to the province's fiscal management and economic prosperity.

MacDonald's deep-rooted connection to his community is evident through his residence in Cornwall, Prince Edward Island. Prior to his political career, he worked as a tourism operator, using his firsthand knowledge and passion for the industry to contribute to its development. Additionally, MacDonald served as the executive director of Quality Tourism Services, further solidifying his expertise in the field.

Embracing new challenges and opportunities, MacDonald made the decision to seek the nomination to run for the federal Liberal party in Malpeque. Announcing his candidacy on 21 June 2021, he presented his vision for a stronger and more prosperous future for his constituents. With his proven track record and dedication to public service, MacDonald won the nomination later that summer and emerged victorious in the 2021 federal election, securing his position as a Member of Parliament.
