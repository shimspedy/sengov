Times are tough in West Virginia and across our nation. The strong economy we built under Republican leadership was hit hard by COVID and now Americans are struggling to make ends meet. We’re mourning and recovering from COVID after losing dear friends and family members, but too many have been left behind. Meanwhile, the politicians and lobbyists in Washington DC care more about raising taxes and spending your hard earned money than they do about rebuilding our economy with good paying jobs.

I’m proud to be a Representative in Congress who will fight for our West Virginia Values and put America first. I'm pro-life, pro-jobs, pro-energy, pro-lower taxes, and I'm in Congress to cut the bull out of politics!

As a small business owner, farmer, and job creator, I've seen first hand how the taxes and regulation from Washington DC hurt West Virginia families and businesses. As a wife, mother, and grandmother, I've raised my family with our Christian values and worked to help those most in need in our community. As a member of Congress, I’ve fought to lower taxes and create jobs, protect our energy industries, fight COVID, and rebuild our economy. 

Those are the West Virginia values I bring to Washington. With your help, I’ll keep fighting to make sure that every West Virginian and every American has the freedom, security, and opportunity we all deserve!
