With over 50,000 acres of farmland across multiple states, his agricultural enterprise thrived. As the largest farmer east of the Mississippi River and a seven-time national corn growing champion, Senator Justice’s passion for nature extended to developing Stoney Brook Plantation, a sprawling 15,000-acre hunting and fishing preserve.

Following the passing of his father in 1993, Senator Justice assumed leadership as President and CEO of Bluestone Industries, Inc. and Bluestone Coal Corporation.

In 2009, Senator Justice’s rescue efforts extended to The Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, which faced bankruptcy and workforce cuts. Determined to revitalize the resort, he reversed benefit reductions and made significant investments in renovations and expansions. His visionary leadership attracted prestigious events like the PGA Tour, LIV Golf Tournament, NFL and NBA training camps, and various high-profile acts and conferences to The Greenbrier.

His exceptional contributions have been recognized through numerous awards, including the Beckley-Raleigh County Chamber of Commerce’s Community Service Award, the City of Hope Medical Center’s “Spirit of Life” award, and the title of “West Virginian of the Year” by esteemed publications and organizations.

FAMILY LIFE

Senator Justice and his wife, Cathy Justice, have been best friends since high school. They recently celebrated their 48th wedding anniversary. The Senator and Cathy have two adult children and spend time spoiling four grandchildren. In addition, they have three dogs: Lucy and Ellie, Boston Terriers, and their famous Babydog, an English Bulldog.

MEET BABYDOG JUSTICE

Babydog Justice, an English Bulldog, was born on October 27, 2019, and soon became a cherished gift from Senator Justice’s children, Jay and Jill, that same year.

At the time, Senator Justice’s grandson had just turned two. With no idea what the word ‘puppy’ meant, he kept asking, “Where did that baby dog go?” as the two played in the Christmas presents. Senator Justice and his family immediately knew the name Babydog was sticking.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Babydog began traveling with Senator Justice to work. Her debut came during Senator Justice’s briefing before Super Bowl LV, where she playfully discouraged large gatherings and famously predicted that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers would score exactly 31 points in their victory.

Babydog quickly captured the hearts of West Virginians everywhere, bringing much-needed joy during uncertain times. In June 2021, Babydog became the official mascot of West Virginia’s COVID-19 “Do It for Babydog” vaccination sweepstakes.

As the Mountain State’s most famous and beloved pup, Babydog has graced major events like Senator Justice’s State of the State address and the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, as well as shows like Fox & Friends. She can often be found traveling DC and West Virginia, shaking paws and bringing smiles to everyone she meets alongside Senator Justice.

Babydog resides in Lewisburg with her dad, mom, and sibling, Ellie, a Boston Terrier. Her favorite things are chicken nuggets, napping, riding shotgun in her dad’s Suburban, and head scratches from everyone she meets.
