#### About Governor Patrick Morrisey  
Patrick James Morrisey is the 37th governor of West Virginia. Morrisey took office on January 13, 2025. He campaigned across all 55 counties during his bid for governor, running to make West Virginia once again the shining state in the mountains.

Before being elected governor, Morrisey served as West Virginia’s Attorney General since 2012. As Attorney General, Morrisey delivered some of the nation’s most significant legal victories to defend West Virginia. He prevailed in West Virginia v. EPA, which has been declared one of the most pivotal U.S. Supreme Court wins in decades.

Morrisey championed major legal wins protecting West Virginians' constitutional rights, delivering record-setting settlements against drug companies, and preserving the West Virginia way of life.  Morrisey has also fought to protect the unborn, preserve Second Amendment rights, and defend girls’ sports.

During his time in public service, Morrisey served as a former Chairman of the Republican Attorney Generals Association, a former Chief Counsel to the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, and an owner of his own law practice. Prior to public office, Morrisey had a distinguished legal career as a former Partner and Practice Chair at a major national law firm. Morrisey is also a former professional Tennis Umpire, and even worked the finals of the U.S. Open.

Morrisey is the son of a World War II veteran and a VA registered nurse. He went on to put himself through Rutgers College and Rutgers School of Law by working multiple jobs while balancing academics and athletics.

Morrisey is married to his wife and First Lady, Denise, and they have one daughter, Julia. He moved to Harpers Ferry in 2006.
