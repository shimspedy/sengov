Congressman Riley M. Moore represents West Virginia's Second District in the U.S. House of Representatives. He sits on the House Appropriations Committee. 

Congressman Moore started his career as a welder in mining operation, and later went on earn degrees from George Mason University and the National Defense University. He has served as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates and most recently served as the 25th State Treasurer of West Virginia. 

While State Treasurer, Congressman Moore fought back against radical anti-fossil fuel ESG policies in the financial services industry. He was the first elected official in America to divest West Virginia tax dollars from BlackRock over their support for ESG. Subsequently, he helped build a coalition of a dozen other states who worked collaboratively to push back on ESG's undue influence in the financial marketplace. 

As Treasurer, Congressman Moore also helped pass and administer both the Hope Scholarship Program and the Jumpstart Savings Program. 

A native of Morgantown, he now lives with his wife Mina and their three children in Harper's Ferry.
