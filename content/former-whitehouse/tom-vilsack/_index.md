Thomas James Vilsack (born December 13, 1950) is an American politician serving as the 32nd United States Secretary of Agriculture in the Biden Administration. He previously served in the role from 2009 to 2017 during the Obama Administration. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 40th governor of Iowa from 1999 to 2007. On November 30, 2006, he formally launched his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2008 election, but ended his bid on February 23, 2007. Then-President-elect Barack Obama announced Vilsack's selection to be Secretary of Agriculture on December 17, 2008. 

His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009. Until his January 13, 2017 resignation one week prior to the end of Obama's second term as president, he had been the only member of the U.S. Cabinet who had served since the day Obama originally took office. 

As of the end of that term he was the fourth-longest-serving holder of the office. On July 19, 2016, The Washington Post reported that Vilsack was on Hillary Clinton's two-person shortlist to be her running mate for that year's presidential election. U.S. Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia was ultimately selected. On December 10, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate Vilsack to once again serve as Secretary of Agriculture in the incoming Biden Administration. Vilsack was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 23, 2021 by a vote of 927.
