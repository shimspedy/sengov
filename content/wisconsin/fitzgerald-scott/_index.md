Elected in 2020, Congressman Scott Fitzgerald represents Wisconsin’s Fifth Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.


Prior to his election to Congress, Fitzgerald served in the Wisconsin State Senate representing the 13th District from 1995 to 2021. During his tenure in the Wisconsin Senate, Scott served as Majority Leader, Minority Leader, Co-Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, and Chairman of the Senate Corrections Committee.


Fitzgerald joined the US Army Reserve in 1981 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Armor Branch in 1985. He completed the Army Command and General Staff College and served in a number of assignments during his 27 years of service, including Battalion Commander. In 2009, he retired from service at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.


Born in Chicago in 1963, Scott later moved to Wisconsin and graduated from Hustisford High School in 1981. He earned his Bachelor of Science from the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in 1985.


Scott purchased and ran the Dodge County Independent News in Juneau, WI in 1990 and sold it in 1996 to the Watertown Daily Times where he was retained as an associate publisher for a number of years.


Scott comes from a family very active in public service. His father, Stephen Fitzgerald, was Sheriff of Dodge County for 14 years, served as the U.S. Marshal for the Western District of Wisconsin and most recently served as the superintendent of the Wisconsin State Patrol until his retirement in 2016. His brother, Jeff, was an Assembly Representative from Dodge County who served as the Assembly Speaker for the 2011-2012 legislative session.


Scott and his wife, Lisa, live in rural Clyman where they raise horses. They have three sons: Scott, Brennan, and Connor.

## Inflation
- Instead of pressuring the oil and gas industry to cap prices, the President should streamline the permitting process for federal land and allow projects like the Keystone XL pipeline to continue. This will not only create thousands of high-paying jobs at a time when Americans need them most but decrease our reliance on oil from our adversaries.                                                                                                                     

- According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the manufacturing industry lost 7.5 million jobs since its peak in 1969, with the most significant drop between 2000 and 2017. Ensuring our tax system is favorable to manufacturers is one way to reverse that trend. Congress and the Administration could work together to make permanent the 100 percent bonus depreciation credit passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is set to begin phasing out at the end of 2022. According to Tax Foundation estimates, making the TCJA bonus depreciation provision permanent would result in higher wages, a larger economy, and 172,300 new full-time jobs.                               

- Since taking office less than two years ago, President Biden’s added $1.9 trillion in debt through the passage of ARPA, lobbied Congress to pass the $2.15 trillion Build Back Better agenda, raised the federal debt limit, and recently endorsed nearly $1 trillion in new spending with more than a third for Green New Deal initiatives. Inflationary pressures will only worsen if we do not work to cut reckless spending.

## Election Integrity
More Americans than ever before have concerns regarding how elections are administered in our country. Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our constitutional republic, and voting is one of the most sacred rights and responsibilities we have as Americans. As your Representative, I am working to defeat proposals like H.R. 1 that would ban commonsense safeguards like Voter ID, assert more federal control of Wisconsin elections, and force taxpayers to fund political campaigns.

## Jobs & Economy
As a former small business owner, I know how tough it can be to ride the waves the economy sends our way. The pandemic sent a tide that reverberated throughout the entire country, and Washington policies have made life harder, not better, for American businesses and workers.


My priority as your Representative is to identify solutions that will get Americans back to work and create lasting benefits to U.S. economic competitiveness. This includes cutting down regulatory red tape that burdens businesses and pushing back against mandates and policies that would eliminate worker freedom and impose a federal minimum wage on small businesses.

## Education
Access to a quality education plays a consequential role in determining a student’s future outcome. No one student is alike, and all children deserve to go to a school that fits their unique needs and learning style. I’m proud that Wisconsin has long been a pioneer in the movement to expand educational access. The first school choice program was born in Milwaukee, and Wisconsin families continue to enjoy freedom in choosing the right type of education for their children today. That’s why I joined the School Choice Caucus here in Congress, to work with like-minded colleagues on this issue and create better outcomes for students.

## Energy
It took the Biden Administration all of one day to sharply depart from their message of unity. Just hours after he was sworn into office, President Biden halted construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The project would have secured many good-paying jobs for hardworking people in Wisconsin, and the pipeline would have secured a safe and reliable way to transport energy.

Energy security is national security and as long as I represent the Fifth District of Wisconsin, I will advocate for proposals that make the United States a more secure and energy independent country.

## Health
All Americans deserve access to quality, affordable healthcare, but a government run healthcare plan is not the answer.

Our healthcare system is already strained and putting the government in charge will only exacerbate the problems facing the system. A government run system would increase costs and wait times for Americans and effectively eliminate private insurance. There are common sense solutions to lower prescription drug prices and protect individuals with pre-existing conditions that would lower healthcare costs and ensure Americans have access to quality, affordable healthcare. Ensuring access to care is important to maintain the health of the American people and I take this responsibility in Congress seriously.

## Veterans
We owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women who put country before self and keep the United States safe and free. They are heroes in my book and deserve benefits and resources that will help them transition into a successful civilian life after service. I will work my heart out to ensure that veterans get the care and services that were promised to them. 

## Agriculture
Agriculture drives Wisconsin's economy and plays a central role in our state heritage. We wear our badge as “America’s Dairyland” proudly and for good reason. The agriculture industry contributes $104.8 billion annually to our state’s economy and creates 435,700 jobs annually.

I will continue working to promote legislation to strengthen agricultural programs, increase job opportunities, lower food costs, and ensure our farmers have the security needed to protect their businesses and provide food for the nation. Setting Wisconsin farmers up for success is a top priority of mine.
