Congresswoman Maxine Dexter M.D. has dedicated her entire life to caring for her community. As a pragmatic progressive, she is committed to bringing people together to build healthy, thriving communities. 

She grew up in the Pacific Northwest in a working-class family. At 16, she was proud to get a union-job at Albertsons, which helped her pursue higher education and become the first in her family to graduate from college. She earned a bachelor's degree in political science and communications from the University of Washington and went on to attend the university’s school of medicine. 

After completing her education, Dexter moved to Portland, Oregon with her husband and two children. She began her career as a lung and critical care physician at Kaiser Permanente. She was the first woman to be elected Chair of the Board of Directors at Northwest Permanente. She served on the Board of Directors for eight years. Dexter approaches complex health issues with compassion and evidence-based practices to achieve the best possible outcomes for her patients. She brings this data-driven pragmatism to her work as a lawmaker. 

In 2020, Dexter became representative for the 33rd district in the Oregon House of Representatives. As Chair of the House Housing and Homelessness Committee, she led the fight to pass a groundbreaking, multi-billion-dollar bill to address the housing and homelessness crisis. She also championed critical legislation to protect abortion access, expand addiction treatment services, protect our public lands, and combat gun violence.

In 2024, Dexter was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She represents Oregon’s 3rd Congressional District, which includes most of Multnomah County, parts of Clackamas County and Hood River County. In Congress, she continues to build on her proven track record of bringing people together to enact evidence-based solutions that build healthier, thriving communities.
