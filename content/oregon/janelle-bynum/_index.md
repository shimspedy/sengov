Congresswoman Janelle Bynum is a working mom of four, small business owner, and former State Legislator who is working to elevate the needs and voices of Oregon’s Fifth. She knows that our voices aren’t being heard in Washington and she sees Congress playing political games with our livelihoods – that’s why she’s working to fix what’s broken and deliver practical solutions to the issues impacting our communities.

As the daughter of teachers, and as a woman of faith, Janelle learned the importance of working to strengthen her community at a young age. Before being elected to Congress, Janelle served for eight years in the Oregon House of Representatives, where she chaired the Committee on Small Business and Economic Development. During her tenure, she was known as a legislator who delivered strong bipartisan results, spearheading efforts to add $43 billion and over 6,000 jobs to Oregon's economy, invest in education, and increase access to the ballot box. As she did in the State House, in Congress she is fighting to create good paying jobs, strengthen public education, address the wildfire crisis, and lower the cost of healthcare, prescription drugs, and housing for working families like hers.

Janelle earned her undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from Florida A&M University, and her MBA from the Ross Business School at the University of Michigan. She and her husband Mark are parents to four children and reside in Happy Valley. Janelle is a devoted sports mom and lifelong lover of all sports, the arts, and good barbecue.
