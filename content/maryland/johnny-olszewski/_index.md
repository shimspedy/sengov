Congressman Johnny “Johnny O” Olszewski, Jr. proudly represents Maryland’s 2nd District, which includes major portions of Baltimore County, Carroll County, and parts of Baltimore City.

A lifelong Marylander who believes in the power of public service, Olszewski is a former public-school teacher, has prior service in the Maryland House of Delegates, and was twice elected as Baltimore County Executive, where he led the state’s third-largest jurisdiction and managed a $5 billion government enterprise.

In the state legislature, Olszewski became the youngest person ever elected Chairman of the Baltimore County House Delegation. A staunch advocate for working families, Olszewski led efforts to provide earned sick leave, raise the minimum wage, and served as a defining vote to secure marriage equality in the State of Maryland.
As County Executive, Olszewski worked to build a better Baltimore County, committing record funding for public education and providing near-universal free community college for county residents. Olszewski made open, transparent, and accountable government a signature of his administration, creating the county’s first public campaign finance system, establishing the county’s first Office of the Inspector General, and launching a signature series of annual Budget Town Hall meetings.

During his tenure, he also led the charge that lead to enactment of bipartisan police reform; passage of bipartisan gun safety legislation; the establishment of the County’s first dedicated Department of Housing and Community Development; the launching of Baltimore County’s first free, fixed-route public transportation service; all the while making record investments in public parks and open space. Olszewski also led widely-praised local government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. 

A product of public schools and a first-generation college graduate, Olszewski holds a bachelor’s degree from Goucher College, a master’s degree from George Washington University, and a Ph.D. from the University of Maryland Baltimore County.

Olszewski lives in eastern Baltimore County with his wife, Marisa, his daughter, Daria, and their rescue dog, Yachty.
