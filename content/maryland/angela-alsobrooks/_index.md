Angela Alsobrooks is a lifelong Marylander who was elected to the United States Senate in 2024. Her north star has always been the lesson her great grandmother taught her — that we all have a responsibility to get off the sidelines, to go farther and do better.

She has dedicated most of her life in public service, championing working families and fighting for safer communities. She believes that children shouldn’t have to live on the margins but instead, be able to pursue their wildest dreams. That means centering policies that elevate working families and provide every Marylander with economic pathways to wealth.

After graduating from Duke University and the University of Maryland School of Law, she worked as a law clerk in the Howard County Circuit Court, and later the Baltimore City Circuit Court. She went on to become the first full-time Assistant State’s Attorney to handle domestic violence cases in Prince George’s County. After holding roles in county government, Angela made history as the youngest and first woman to be elected Prince George’s County State’s Attorney.

As the Chief Law Enforcement Officer, Angela fought every day to create safer communities. During her tenure, violent crime fell by 50 percent.

In 2018, Angela was elected Prince George’s County Executive. She focused on generating economic opportunity in the County, and within two years, she became one of the top job creators in the entire state.

Angela Alsobrooks is the proud mother of her daughter Alex.
