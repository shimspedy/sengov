Sarah Elfreth broke barriers in 2018, becoming the youngest woman ever elected to the Maryland State Senate. Over six years, Sarah built a reputation as one of Maryland's most effective legislators, passing 91 bipartisan bills into law. Her work has focused on issues that directly impact Maryland families, including protecting the Chesapeake Bay, expanding prenatal care, and supporting veterans with PTSD. She has been recognized as “Legislator of the Year” by numerous organizations and serves on the Chesapeake Bay Commission, helping coordinate State and federal environmental clean up efforts. Known for her collaborative approach, Sarah brings people together to solve problems and do what’s right.

Now Congresswoman, Sarah looks forward to representing the communities of Maryland’s Anne Arundel, Howard, and Carroll Counties with the same energy and dedication to partnership on Capitol Hill. A proud graduate of Towson University and the Johns Hopkins University, Sarah lives in Annapolis with her dog Ollie, where she enjoys hiking, being on the water, and collecting oyster plates.
