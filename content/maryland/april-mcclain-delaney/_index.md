Congresswoman April McClain Delaney was elected in 2024 to represent Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District, which encompasses all or parts of Montgomery, Frederick, Washington, Allegany, and Garrett Counties.

Growing up in Buhl, Idaho, as the daughter of a potato farmer, April learned the value of hard work, perseverance, and education. She earned her Bachelor’s Degree from Northwestern University and her Juris Doctor from Georgetown University, where she met her husband, former Congressman John Delaney.

Before running for Congress, April served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Communications at the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Director of Washington, D.C.’s Common Sense Media. During her time with Common Sense Media, April worked to safeguard children online and address the effects of media on children’s mental health and well-being. At NTIA, April spearheaded efforts to expand broadband access and digital equity, focusing on bringing high-speed internet and workforce training to rural communities nationwide. She also strengthened the nation’s cybersecurity, particularly through the First Responder Network, and played a key role in the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse, enhancing protections against gender-based online threats.

With over three decades of leadership spanning the private, public, and nonprofit sectors, April has built a career delivering results for Americans. In Congress, April is dedicated to bridging the digital divide, holding Big Tech accountable, and championing policies and innovation that move America forward and expand opportunity for all.

April resides in Montgomery County with her husband, John, and their four children: Summer, Brooke, Lily, and Grace.
