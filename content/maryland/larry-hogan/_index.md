     greeting: contact Governor Larry Hogan 
     description: Governor Lawrence J. Hogan, Jr. was sworn in as the 62nd governor of the State of Maryland on January 21, 2015. In 2018, he was overwhelmingly re-elected to a second four-year term, receiving the most votes of any Maryland gubernatorial candidate and becoming only the second Republican governor to be re-elected in the 242-year history of the state. Prior to his election in 2014, Governor Hogan – who had never before held elective office – spent more than 25 years building and running small businesses in the private sector. In 2011, he founded Change Maryland, the largest nonpartisan grassroots citizen organization in state history, which is dedicated to bringing fiscal responsibility and common sense to state government. Governor Hogan is married to Yumi Hogan, a first generation Korean-American, artist and teacher. She is the first Asian first lady in Maryland history and the first Korean-American first lady in United States history. They have three daughters Julie, Jaymi, and Kim; four grandchildren  Daniella, Cam, Ada and Nora; and two dogs, Anna and Chessie, whom they rescued from BARCS animal shelter in Baltimore City in 2018.
