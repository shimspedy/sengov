Congressman Eugene Vindman proudly represents the Seventh District of Virginia which stretches across eleven localities in the central and northern areas of the Commonwealth.

When he was 4 years old, Eugene came with his family to the U.S. as refugees fleeing Soviet Ukraine with less than $800 in their pockets. Eugene grew up in New York where he attended public schools and public university before receiving his ROTC commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army.

In the Army, he served as an infantry officer and paratrooper including assignments in the 82D Airborne Division and as a company commander leading troops. Soon after, he transitioned to the U.S. Army Judge Advocate Generals (JAG) Corps. As a JAG, Eugene served as an international law advisor in Iraq; as the senior prosecutor in the busiest jurisdiction in the Army; and as a White House National Security Council (NSC) deputy legal advisor. He attained the rank of Colonel before retiring in 2022 after 25 years of service.

After retirement, Eugene investigated war crimes in Ukraine for 18 months, completing 14 trips as a senior consultant for a Department of State funded program. He is a recognized expert in criminal international law and has published extensively on topics related to national security and international relations.

Eugene has dedicated his life to serving our country and decided to continue this mission and run for office in 2024. In Congress, he will work with both sides of the aisle to lower costs, improve public education, and protect our basic rights and freedoms.

He and his wife Cindy have raised their son and daughter in Dale City, Virginia where their children attend public schools.
