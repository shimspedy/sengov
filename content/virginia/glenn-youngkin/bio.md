#### Gov. ‍Glenn Youngkin bio
‍Glenn Youngkin is a homegrown Virginian who grew up in Richmond and Virginia Beach. As his father changed jobs, Governor-Elect Youngkin learned that moving around didn’t equal moving up – nothing was handed to him. From his first job washing dishes and frying eggs at a diner in Virginia Beach, he embraced hard work and responsibility to help his family when his father lost his job. His determination to succeed earned him multiple high school basketball honors in Virginia and an athletic scholarship to college.

After earning an engineering degree at Rice University, and his MBA at Harvard Business School, Governor-Elect Youngkin and his wife Suzanne moved to Northern Virginia. He landed a job at The Carlyle Group, where he spent the next 25 years. Working his way to the top of the company, Governor-Elect Youngkin played a key role in building Carlyle into one of the leading investment firms in the world. His efforts have helped fund the retirements of teachers, police officers, firefighters and other frontline public servants and supported hundreds of thousands of American jobs.

Married for over 27 years to his amazing wife Suzanne, Governor-Elect Youngkin is a dedicated father of four wonderful children. Their family journey has been and continues to be guided by their faith.

#### service and committed 
Glenn Youngkin has long heard a call to service and committed time to serving his community and the people around him. Governor-Elect Youngkin volunteered to coach multiple youth basketball teams, and he served on the boards of many non-profit organizations, including the Virginia Ready Initiative, Virginia Tech’s Innovation Campus Advisory Board, the Museum of the Bible, and the Meadowkirk Retreat Center.

He also served as Church Warden at Holy Trinity Church in Northern Virginia and is a member of the Business Council and the American Enterprise Institute's National Council.

#### Leadership
‍Governor-Elect Youngkin is a new type of governor, a governor who understands that the challenges we face are better taken on together – with new ideas and common-sense.

Governor-Elect Youngkin is ready to go to work on day one and will bring to the Governor’s Office 30 years of successful, real-world business experience, to rebuild a better Virginia for everyone who calls it home. It’s a new day in Virginia.
