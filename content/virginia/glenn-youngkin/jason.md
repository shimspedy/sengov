#### About the Attorney General Jason Miyares
Attorney General Jason Miyares' story doesn't start in Virginia Beach, Virginia, but in Havana, Cuba when his mother, Miriam Miyares, fled communist Cuba, penniless and homeless. She taught Jason a love for freedom, democracy, and that America is indeed the “last best hope on earth.” A product of Virginia public schools, Jason graduated with a Bachelor’s in Business Administration from James Madison University and received his J.D. from the College of William and Mary School of Law.

He previously served as a prosecutor in the Virginia Beach Commonwealth’s Attorney Office, where he worked alongside law enforcement to keep violent criminals off our streets and our communities safe.

In 2015, almost fifty years to the day that she fled Cuba, Miriam was able to vote for her son Jason Miyares to represent her in the oldest democracy in the Western Hemisphere, the Virginia House of Delegates. While representing Virginia Beach, Jason was recognized as “Legislator of the Year” in both 2018 and 2019 from the College Affordability and Public Trust for his work on transparency and affordability in higher education, as well as by the Hampton Roads Military Officers Association of America in 2018. He was also recognized in 2019 by the Safe House Project for his work combatting human trafficking, an issue that his administration is prioritizing.

Jason Miyares is the first Cuban American elected to the General Assembly, the first Hispanic elected statewide in Virginia, and the first son of an immigrant ever elected to be Attorney General. He is passionate about preserving the American Miracle for the next generation of Virginians.
