McGuire is serving his first term in the House of Representatives representing Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. In the 119th Congress, John serves on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. As the representative for more than 775,000 Virginia residents, John is focused on keeping costs low for families, protecting and defending the American people and our interests at home and abroad, shrinking the size and scope of the federal government, and supporting a robust and reliable infrastructure system and agriculture base.

John was born and raised in Central Virginia. As a child, he was abandoned and spent his early childhood years in the foster care system, attending nine different elementary schools. By the grace of God, his grandparents rescued him and his older sister from the foster care system and raised them until their dad obtained sobriety. John is incredibly proud of his father John J. McGuire, Jr. who saw one son promoted to brigadier general in the Virginia National Guard, celebrated his 41st anniversary of sobriety, and saw John McGuire, III, elected to Congress in a five-day period of November 2024.

John set his sights on becoming a Navy SEAL in high school.  He immediately enlisted in the United States Navy after and obtained his dream.  He spent 10 years as a Navy SEAL, became a sniper, did several deployments to countries across the world defending our nation against evil, and became a sniper instructor before returning home to Virginia.

Back in his hometown in Central Virginia, John founded his small business, SEAL Team PT, Inc., a fitness organization dedicated to helping teams and individuals become stronger, healthier, and more confident.  John and his team have trained individuals, companies, and sports teams around the country and overseas.  His company has been part of eighteen division one championships. John has mentored nine young men who have become Navy SEALs as well as others who became Air Force PJs, Army Special forces, MARSOC, pilots, Secret Service agents, and more. 

In 2018, John was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he quickly developed a reputation as a conservative leader in consensus building and problem solving. Six years later, John was elected to the Virginia State Senate where he served on the Local Government Committee, the Privileges and Elections Committee, and the Transportation Committee. In that time, he led efforts to pass legislation to allow elementary, middle, and high school nurses to store and administer naloxone in response to the opioid crisis. Additionally, he passed legislation to decrease taxes on Virginia veteran retirement pay during a period of divided government.

John and his wife, Tracy have raised five children and now live in Goochland, Virginia.
