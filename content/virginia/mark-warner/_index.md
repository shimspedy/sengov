#### About Senator Warner
Senator Warner was elected to the U.S. Senate in November 2008 and reelected to a third term in November 2020. He serves on the Senate Finance, Banking, Budget, and Rules Committees as well as the Select Committee on Intelligence, where he is the Chairman. During his time in the Senate, Senator Warner has established himself as a bipartisan leader who works across the aisle to ensure that Virginians are able to count on their government when they need it the most.

Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, Senator Warner effectively worked to grease the wheels of Congress, lending his strong support to numerous relief bills and leading negotiations between Democrats and Republicans that resulted in the passage of the December 2020 emergency relief legislation. 

Senator Warner has also been recognized as a national leader in fighting for families, hardworking Virginians, and our military men and women. He has successfully championed various bipartisan efforts to invest in our nationâ€™s infrastructure, create good-paying jobs, address abuses by private military housing companies, boost American competition and innovation, reduce the maintenance backlog at our National Parks, and promote economic equity among historically disadvantaged groups and communities.

From 2002 to 2006, he served as Governor of Virginia. When he left office in 2006, Virginia was ranked as the best state for business, the best-managed state, and the best state in which to receive a public education.

The first in his family to graduate from college, Mark Warner spent 20 years as a successful technology and business leader in Virginia before entering public office. An early investor in the cellular telephone business, he co-founded the company that became Nextel and invested in hundreds of start-up technology companies that created tens of thousands of jobs.

Senator Warner and his wife Lisa Collis live in Alexandria, Virginia. They have three daughters.
