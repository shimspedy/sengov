Congressman John Joyce, M.D. has served the 13th District of Pennsylvania since 2019. Before running for office, he worked in Blair County with his wife, Dr. Alice Joyce. He was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania to Bernie ands Peggy (Hallinan) Joyce, the third generation of the Joyce family to be born and raised in Altoona.

A 1975 graduate of Bishop Guilfoyle High School, John attended Penn State Altoona for two years, and then continued his undergraduate education at Penn State University Park. He graduated with honors with a degree in biology in 1979. John continued his education at Temple University receiving his M.D. in 1983.

Subsequently, he completed a 3 year internal medicine residency as a Johns Hopkins fellow in Baltimore, Maryland. He then completed a residency in Dermatology at Johns Hopkins finishing as chief resident. Dr. Joyce is a fellow in the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Dermatology.

After leaving Johns Hopkins Hospital, Joyce worked with the United States Navy at Portsmouth Naval Hospital in Virginia during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He received commendations from U.S. Navy Rear Admiral David B. LeStage for his work during this time.

Upon completion of his time with the Navy, Dr. Joyce returned to his hometown, Altoona, with his wife Alice and their three children, where they established Altoona Dermatology Associates. For over 25 years, Dr. Joyce and his wife have cared for patients in the Central Pennsylvania area, serving all ten counties in the 13th Congressional district.

John has served on the Advisory Board of the Penn State Altoona Campus, the American Cancer Society, The United Way, the Goodman Trust, as a mentor for the Eberly College of Science at Penn State, and as a volunteer at the St. Vincent DePaul Soup Kitchen. He is a life-long member of the Cathedral in Altoona.

In Congress, John is fighting for Pennsylvanians' commonsense, conservative values - strengthening our economy, improving Pennsylvanians' access to quality and affordable health care, and defending our Constitutional rights. There's more work to be done, and he's running for re-election to continue the fight. 


## SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE
As a doctor and son from a middle class family, I know that seniors count on Medicare and Social Security. They’ve worked hard to build our great nation and we must keep our commitment to them. I do not support any bill or changes that would affect those near retirement age.  I believe we need to protect Social Security and Medicare and make sure they are around for future generations.

## IMMIGRATION
America must end the flow of illicit drugs, human trafficking, and gang violence that enter our nation from the porous southern border. In Congress, I have supported President Trump's pro-security agenda, including funding for the border wall. The U.S. must create a secure border and reform the immigration system to ensure it attracts the best and brightest from other countries while always putting the safety of America first. 

## PRO-LIFE
When I graduated from medical school, I took the Hippocratic Oath, which includes the pledge to never perform, assist or support an abortion. I am staunchly pro-life. We have a moral obligation to protect the most vulnerable in our society – our unborn children, and I am proud to serve as a pro-life voice in Congress.  

## SECOND AMENDMENT
In Congress, I am a staunch defender of the Second Amendment. Extremists on the left want to infringe on Americans' rights and take away law-abiding citizens' guns, but that's not an answer to gun violence. Instead, we should enforce existing laws, improve America's mental health care system, and support school safety measures. We can protect Americans without taking away the rights of sportsmen, hunters, and those who choose to protect themselves and their families with a firearm. 

## MILITARY
Alongside President Trump, I believe that America must pursue peace through strength. After too many years of neglect under the previous administration, we are rebuilding our military and ensuring that our troops have the resources and training they need to defend our nation at home and abroad. In Congress, I am a strong advocate for our military and for installations such as Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD), which supports the brave men and women defending our freedoms.

## VETERANS
It’s not enough to just take care of those who are serving us today. We have an obligation, and a duty, to take care of those who have formerly served our great nation. My wife is a Navy veteran and I myself previously worked at Portsmouth Naval Hospital as well as the Altoona VA Hospital, I know firsthand of the sacrifice these brave men and women make day in and day out.  The VA system is failing our veterans who deserve to get the care they need. In Congress, I will fight every day to make the system better and to make sure our veterans get the best possible care they deserve. I believe that any veteran should be able to walk into any hospital and get the care they deserve.  

## HEALTH CARE
As a doctor, I understand firsthand that Obamacare has been a failure and burden to American patients. In Congress, I am working on solutions to lower the cost of prescription drugs, protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, defend Medicare, expand access to health care in rural communities, and develop free-market solutions. As Democrats push their socialist "Medicare-for-None" agenda, I will protect Americans' choices and access to quality, affordable health care. 

## TRANSPORTATION
Strengthening our infrastructure and transportation system should be a top priority for our federal government. We must invest in roads, bridges, ports, and airports for the 21st century. The federal government should incentivize the private sector to join us in building infrastructure that leverages state, local, federal, and private money. But, one thing that I cannot support is increasing the gas tax. Pennsylvania already has the highest gas tax in the nation– we cannot possibly add more of a burden to families, workers, and small businesses. 

## JOB CREATION
Job creation and a growing economy are essential to our nation's success. Building on the historic tax cuts, Congress must continue to strengthen our economy and reduce barriers to job creation. We also need to get government spending under control, eliminate burdensome regulations, and create additional tax relief for American workers. Additionally, we must make the individual tax relief permanent – so that taxpayers can have the same sort of predictability that we have afforded job creators. 

## ENDING THE GRIP OF SPECIAL INTERESTS
Special interests in Washington DC have enough influence over members of Congress – I am running to represent the people of the 13th Congressional District.  I believe we must put into place common sense reforms in order to make the system work for the people again – including making sure Congress lives under the same rules as the rest of us.
