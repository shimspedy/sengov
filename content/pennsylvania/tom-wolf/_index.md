     greeting: contact Governor Tom Wolf 
     description: On January 20, 2015, Tom Wolf was sworn in as Pennsylvaniaâ€™s 47th governor. Gov. Wolf grew up in a small south central Pennsylvania town in York County and still lives in the house he was brought home to from the hospital. Gov. Wolf left York County to attend college at Dartmouth, but he interrupted his studies to join the Peace Corps and served two years in a small village in India before returning to finish his undergraduate degree. He later earned graduate degrees from the University of London and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While finishing his PhD, Gov. Wolf worked as a forklift operator and warehouse worker in the family business, the Wolf Organization, a distributor of lumber and other building products based in York, Pennsylvania. After graduating, his first full-time job was running a Tru-Value hardware store in Manchester, Pennsylvania. He later went on to buy his family business. Tom and Frances, his wife of over 40 years, still live in York County and have two grown daughters, Sarah and Katie.
