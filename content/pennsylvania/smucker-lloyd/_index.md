Lloyd Smucker wants to reignite the American Dream. He believes this can be achieved by working to increase economic opportunity for everyone, reining in Washingtonâ€™s out-of-control spending, and providing regulatory relief to small businesses so they can expand and create jobs.

Prior to being elected to Congress, Rep. Smucker owned and operated the Smucker Company for 25 years, and grew the small business to eventually employ more than 150 people.

He served two terms in the Pennsylvania State Senate where he chaired the Committee on Education. In that capacity, he pioneered reforms to increase accountability in education spending and worked to ensure Pennsylvania students had access to quality education. Rep. Smucker led the charge to hold elected officials accountable by proposing reforms to the ethics guidelines. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, he made it a priority to rein in spending and built a reputation as an independent-minded conservative who seeks creative solutions to complex problems.

Rep. Smucker serves on the Committee on Ways & Means and the Committee on the Budget. 

He lives in West Lampeter Township with his wife, Cindy, and three children.
