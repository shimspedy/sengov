#### U.S. Senator Bob Casey fights every day for Pennsylvania families
He is a strong advocate for policies that will raise wages for the middle class and improve early learning opportunities and health care for children. Senator Casey serves on four committees, including the Finance Committee, the HELP Committee, and the Select Committee on Intelligence. He is also the Chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, where his agenda is focused on policies that support seniors and individuals with disabilities.

Born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Senator Casey graduated from The College of the Holy Cross in 1982, and spent the following year teaching fifth grade and coaching eighth grade basketball in inner city Philadelphia for the Jesuit Volunteer Corps.  He received his law degree from Catholic University in 1988, and entered the practice of law in Scranton.  Senator Casey and his wife, Terese, live in Scranton and have four adult daughters.

Bob Casey is a champion for Pennsylvanians in the U.S. Senate, fighting for the needs of children, families, and workers across the Commonwealth.
The words "all public service is a trust, given in faith and accepted in honor” are inscribed over the front door of the Finance Building in Harrisburg, and are principles that have guided Senator Casey throughout his time in public service.  Since he was elected to the United States Senate in 2006, he has fought for the needs of workers, children, and families in the Commonwealth and across the Nation.

#### Advocating for children
Senator Casey is a nationally recognized advocate for children.  He has championed programs to improve child health and education, spurred by his belief that all children deserve a strong start in life, and that the economic health of our Nation rests upon how well we help prepare our children for success. This belief led to the creation of the Five Freedoms for America’s Children, a detailed plan to secure the blessings of freedom for the children of today and tomorrow.  This plan identifies five basic freedoms that our society must guarantee to our Nation's children, and recommends policy changes to ensure those freedoms for all children: freedom to be healthy, freedom to be economically secure, freedom to learn, freedom from hunger, and freedom to be safe from harm.  Legislation sponsored by Senator Casey that has become law includes major portions of the Keep Kids in School Act, the Emergency Medical Services for Children Reauthorization Act, and the Health Insurance for Former Foster Youth Act.

Senator Casey is also a tireless advocate for the food and nutritional needs of American families and children, and has been a strong advocate for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other nutrition programs that help vulnerable children and families in Pennsylvania.  SNAP serves more than 800,000 children each year.

As concerns arose across the nation about the dangers of campus sexual assault, Senator Casey took action and passed into law the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act.  These regulations strengthen reporting standards on college campuses so that instances of sexual violence are reported in a uniform manner and victims are provided with appropriate support.


#### Keeping our promise to older Americans
As the Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Senator Casey has led Senate efforts to ensure that our Nation’s seniors have the resources and support they need in their older age.  Senator Casey’s Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act became law in July 2018 and created a federal advisory council charged with developing a one-stop-shop of information to help grandparents raising grandchildren and other kinship caregivers raising relative children address challenges that they may face.


#### Fighting for people with disabilities
Through his Committee work, Senator Casey continues to be the Senate’s leader on disability rights, leading a total of 19 disability policy bills in 2019 alone that covered education, health, employment, financial security, civil rights, disaster preparation and relief, veterans, and Social Security.  He was the prime Senate sponsor of landmark legislation for individuals with disabilities, the Stephen Beck Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience Act (ABLE).  ABLE will allow millions of families across the United States to save for the long term care of their loved ones with a disability by using a tax-advantage savings account.  The Associated Press hailed this legislation as “the most important new law for [those with disabilities] in 25 years.”  Senator Casey believes that people with disabilities have a lot of ability, and we must give those with disabilities the tools to succeed in the workforce and to live a full life.


#### Building a better economy
Across Pennsylvania, Senator Casey works to boost initiatives that create good-paying jobs and grow local economies.  He believes creating opportunity for Pennsylvania businesses and workers is key to creating jobs and investing in the economic future of the Commonwealth.  During his time in the Senate, Senator Casey has fought to increase the minimum wage, ensure equal pay for equal work, and enhance worker protections.

Increasing opportunity also means creating conditions under which workers and businesses can prosper.  As a member of the Finance Committee, Senator Casey has worked to pass legislation to make it easier for small businesses to plan for capital investments that are vital to job creation; voted to provide billions for tax cuts to encourage businesses to hire workers; and strongly supported extending tax breaks that promote innovation and research that drives our economy.  He has also advocated for increased investment in the roads, bridges, and ports that are vital to the Pennsylvania economy.

Senator Casey has worked to eliminate policies that rig the economic system against American workers.  He has continuously fought against unfair trade policies that force American workers to compete on a playing field that is not level.  He has pushed for the U.S. government to take stronger action against China in response to the undervaluing of its currency and other policies that result in American job loss.  He also voted for legislation to eliminate tax policies that make it easier for companies to send U.S. jobs overseas.

#### From Scranton to Washington
Prior to coming to Washington, in his eight years as Pennsylvania Auditor General and two years as State Treasurer, Senator Casey compiled a record that focused on making government more accountable and responsive to the needs of Pennsylvanians.  He has been a fiscal watchdog who made nursing homes safer, child care more affordable, and government more accountable.  To date, Senator Casey continues to utilize the lessons he learned growing up in Scranton to stand up and speak out for the hard-working families who are the heart and soul of our Nation.
