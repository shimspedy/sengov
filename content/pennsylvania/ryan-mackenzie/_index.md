Ryan Mackenzie is in his first term as a Member of the United States House of Representatives. He represents the 7th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which covers all of Lehigh, Northampton, and Carbon Counties and part of Monroe County.

Ryan serves on three committees in the U.S. House: Education and Workforce, Foreign Affairs, and Homeland Security. Through these committee assignments, he continues his work to improve education and workforce development, bring about peace through American strength, and advocate for safe and secure communities.

Before being elected to Congress, Ryan served as a Member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 2012-2024. During his time in the state House, he was Republican chair of the Labor & Industry Committee and co-chair of the International Relations Caucus. Ryan authored a dozen laws that improved healthcare, strengthened the American workforce, protected taxpayers and consumers, preserved the local environment, helped our veterans and first responders, and reformed government.

Prior to elected office, Ryan was the policy director at the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. He worked on a number of political campaigns and earned his real estate sales license before entering public service by accepting a position at the U.S. Department of Labor in the Office of the Secretary.

Ryan has also served on numerous nonprofit and government boards. His work has included extensive service with local nonprofits that help seniors with affordable housing and individuals with autism, regional organizations like Lehigh Career & Technical Institute and the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, statewide boards focused on workforce and economic development, advisory boards for both the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and the Presidentâ€™s Commission on White House Fellowships.

Ryan is a ninth-generation resident of the Lehigh Valley, where his family has lived since colonial times. He graduated from Parkland High School, received his undergraduate degree in Finance and International Business from New York University, and earned his Master in Business Administration from Harvard Business School.

Ryan and his wife, Chloe, reside in the Lehigh Valley with their newborn son Leo and rescue hound dog Ruckus.
