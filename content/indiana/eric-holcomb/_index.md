Eric Holcomb is Indiana’s 51st Governor, but you’re just as likely to find him on the basketball court (he’s made a basket in all of Indiana’s 92 counties) or at a local diner or gathering place (like the Cone Palace in Kokomo) as you are the Statehouse. Eric is laser-focused on fighting this pandemic and building One Indiana for All. That’s centered on growth, opportunity, and – as Eric says – is “people, people, people.”

For Eric, it’s about getting our economy Back on Track while protecting the health of Hoosiers. It’s about helping Hoosiers build the skills they need to land a good-paying job. It’s about helping Hoosiers rid themselves of a drug dependency, so they can lift up themselves and their families. And it’s about keeping Indiana the fiscal envy of the nation and delivering great government service at a great taxpayer value.
