Jefferson Shreve was elected to represent Indiana’s 6th Congressional District in 2024. He was sworn into the 119th Congress. Prior to serving in the US House of Representatives, he grew a real estate business from a start-up into a multi-state enterprise, with 26 locations in the district. He later merged his company into a national firm that trades on the New York Stock Exchange. He served on the board of directors of Extra Space, an S&P 500 company, before serving in Congress.

Congressman Shreve serves on the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee and on the Foreign Affairs Committee. His legislative priorities center on reining in reckless federal spending, toward getting our national debt crisis under control. He’s working with the Republican majority to secure our borders and our conservative Hoosier values.

Shreve graduated from Indiana University. He later earned his master's degree in international studies from the University of London. He also graduated from Purdue University, with an MBA in agribusiness. He’s volunteered decades of higher ed leadership:  Jefferson was elected to the board and as National Chairman of the Indiana University Alumni Association. He serves on the Executive Dean’s board for IU’s College of Arts & Sciences, and on the IU Indianapolis Chancellor’s Board.

Shreve also volunteered his business experience in service on the board and executive committee of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, and on a hospital system board. Jefferson was also elected chairman of the Self Storage Association board.

A proud Hoosier, Shreve served two terms on the City-County Council of his hometown of Indianapolis. Jefferson and his wife Mary continue to call Perry Township home.
