Born and raised in Southern Indiana, Mark embodies the values that make our communities strong: hard work, integrity, and service to others.

Mark and his wife Kim have been married for 39 years and have raised four children together. As small business owners, Mark and Kim understand firsthand how reducing government overreach fosters job creation and strengthens local economies.

Before serving in Congress, Mark demonstrated strong leadership in the Indiana Statehouse, advancing policies that spurred economic growth and created jobs for Hoosiers. He also fought to protect individual liberties and fight against government overreach.

In the House of Representatives as a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee, he champions policies that promote national security, empower farmers, and support working families.

Mark and his wife Kim are active members of Holy Family Catholic Church in Jasper where Mark has been involved in many activities, including serving as a music minister, the Parish Council, the Holy Family School Board, and the Cursillo program.

In Congress, Mark fights every day to protect Hoosier values and ensure a brighter future for the families in the Eighth District and all Americans.
