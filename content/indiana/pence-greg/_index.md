U.S Representative Greg Pence represents Indiana's 6th District, where he lives with his wife Denise in Columbus. He is a proud husband, father, grandfather, Marine officer and small businessman who will ensure Indiana's 6th District continues its strong tradition of leadership in Congress.

Joining the Marine Corps in 1979 in his hometown of Columbus, Pence considers his role in Congress as a new opportunity to serve the community, state, and country that he loves. Pence understands that the 6th District needs a leader who will prioritize constituents and ensure Hoosiers always have a seat at the table.

"It is an honor and a privilege to serve the people of Indiana's 6th District," Pence said. "I will always put Hoosiers of the 6th District and Indiana first."

Pence serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Subcommittee on Energy and Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce in the 117th Congress.

"My priorities will always include job creation, economic growth, and the protection of our conservative values in Washington," Pence said. "I am honored to represent the place I live and the only place I will ever call home."
