Congresswoman Victoria Spartz immigrated to the United States in 2000 after meeting her husband Jason, a born and raised Hoosier, on a train in Europe. She became a US Citizen and worked her way up from being a bank teller to a CPA, finance executive, successful business owner, and Indiana State Senator.

Growing up in Ukraine molded her conservative political philosophy that limited government is always better, and financial and healthcare decisions should be made by individuals in the free market, not bureaucrats and special interests.

Rep. Spartz worked in the Big 4 public accounting firms for Fortune 500 companies, taught as an adjunct faculty member at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, and served as the CFO at the Indiana Attorney General’s Office. She also started several businesses in financial consulting, farming, and real estate.

Rep. Spartz earned a Bachelor of International Economics and Master of Business Administration from the National University of Economics in Ukraine as well as a Master of Professional Accountancy from the Indiana University Kelley School of Business in Indianapolis. She also completed the Harvard Business School Executive Education program on health care.

She currently serves on the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary and Education and Labor committees.

Rep. Spartz and her husband Jason reside in Noblesville with their two daughters.
