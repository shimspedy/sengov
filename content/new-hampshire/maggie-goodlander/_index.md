Maggie Goodlander proudly represents New Hampshire’s Second District. She was born and raised in Nashua – the city that her family has called home for more than 100 years. Growing up in New Hampshire instilled in Maggie the values of community, citizenship, service, and that our democracy isn’t something you watch happen from the sidelines – it’s something you participate in.

Maggie has dedicated her life to serving New Hampshire and our country and is fighting every day to ensure every Granite Stater gets a fair deal.

Maggie began her career working as a foreign policy advisor to Senator John McCain in the United States Senate where she helped write landmark sanctions legislation and strengthen democracy around the world. She went on to serve as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve for over a decade.

After graduating from law school and serving as a law clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer on the United States Supreme Court, Maggie returned to New Hampshire to fight for the most vulnerable Granite Staters and to teach constitutional law at the University of New Hampshire and Dartmouth.

Driven by her belief that no politician is above the law, Maggie served as counsel in the first impeachment of President Donald Trump. Maggie went on to the U.S. Department of Justice where she took on corporate monopolies as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, committed to the idea that no corporation is above the law, either.

Before she was elected to represent New Hampshire’s Second District in Congress in November 2024, Maggie served as a senior advisor at the White House where she led the Unity Agenda for the Nation, dedicated to solving five big challenges that unite us as a nation: beating the opioid epidemic, tackling our mental health crisis, holding Big Tech accountable, meeting our sacred obligation to veterans, and ending cancer as we know it.
