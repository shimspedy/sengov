#### About Rep Chris Pappas 
For Congressman Chris Pappas, public service has always been about finding ways to give back to the community that has given him so much. A lifelong resident of Manchester, New Hampshire, Chris was born into a proud Greek-American family. After graduating from Harvard, Chris returned home where he began a career in public service while helping run the 103 year-old family restaurant where he started scooping ice cream and bussing tables at age 14.

In Congress, Chris focuses on the issues that matter most to Granite Staters, including improving access to health care, lowering the high cost of prescription drugs, combating the addiction epidemic, and protecting our environment and drinking water. 

As the Chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations for the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Chris is committed to holding VA leadership accountable while serving our veterans who have sacrificed so much. He is working to protectwhistleblowers who come forward to report waste, fraud, and abuse and to ensure that more veterans can access quality care in their communities. Chris also serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee where he is fighting to modernize our nation’s infrastructure and invest in projects that will create jobs and improve quality of life in New Hampshire. 

Before entering the U.S. House of Representatives, Chris served as a member of the state’s Executive Council. In this role he worked with governors of both parties to implement Medicaid expansion, expand treatment and recovery services, approve funding for family planning providers, and support renewable energy and infrastructure projects.
