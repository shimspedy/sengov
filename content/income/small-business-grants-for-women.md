The SBA typically does not offer grant funding directly to small businesses. However, with the PRIME program, the SBA provides federal grants to microenterprise development organizations so that they can offer training, technical assistance and coaching to disadvantaged small-business owners. These grants are available to nonprofit, private, state, local or tribal-run organizations, including those that focus on working with women-owned small businesses. For example, the Wisconsin Women's Business Initiative Corporation was awarded a $200,000 grant in 2022. This program provides an excellent opportunity for small business owners and entrepreneurs who are looking for resources and training to grow their business and overcome obstacles.

### Women's Business Centers
The Small Business Administration (SBA) sponsors over 100 Women's Business Centers throughout the country, which are designed to assist women entrepreneurs with business development and access to capital.

Every state and many cities have economic development resources focused on promoting strong local economies. These resources can provide assistance to local businesses, such as help with accessing state and federal funding. For example, the California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development helps small businesses apply for federal and state grants.
