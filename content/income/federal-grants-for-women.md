There are thousands of federal grants that benefit women. However, if you think the U.S. government will give a woman a direct grant just because she is a woman, you will be disappointed. It doesn't work that way. The U.S. federal government has over 900 federal grant programs. Some of these grants are designed to help women with specific needs or living in specific geographic locations.

As you will see from the lists below, the U.S. federal government offers a wide range of diverse grant opportunities that address issues for women not only in America but around the world. To qualify for a federal grant, nonprofit organizations should be stable and mature entities that have been in the business of helping women for at least 3-5 years and have a good record of developing community partnerships with other helping organizations. The agency should have case histories of women who have been helped by their program, have kept track of the numbers of women served during the previous years, and be stable financially before applying for a federal grant.

Since the U.S. government mainly gives grants to non-profit organizations that help women rather than to individual women, it may be easier to obtain a grant through such an organization. Keep in mind federal bank holidays when contacting these grant-giving organizations, as they may be closed on these dates.

However, if you are a woman looking for a grant to help you pay for your education, there are government programs ready to assist individual women. These government grants for women help American women from all walks of life. Many women earn their degrees online while taking care of their children at home or while working a daytime job.
