##  Federal Grants for Minority-Owned Businesses

Federal grants are financial awards provided by government agencies to support public purposes authorized by U.S. law. These grants are not benefits, entitlements, or loans but are intended for charitable or public-benefit projects. Recipients must adhere to specific requirements and fulfill grant obligations.

### Goals of Federal Grants

Federal grants aim to benefit the community and society as a whole. Grants for minorities help improve living conditions by providing access to higher education and professional advancement. U.S. citizens who identify as African-American, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American can qualify for these grants.

### Minority Business Grants

If youâ€™re a minority looking to start a small business, consider looking locally for grant money. Examples of regional organizations offering small business grants for minorities include:
- **Brotherhood Business Development & Capital Fund**
- **Operation HOPE**
- **FAME Renaissance**
- **Pacific Coast Regional**

Your local Chamber of Commerce may also have information on funding opportunities. For established minority businesses, the National Minority Supply and Diversity Council connects minority-owned businesses with larger companies seeking goods and services. For grants specifically for Black women-owned businesses, visit Small Business Grants for Black Women.
