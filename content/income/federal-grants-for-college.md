## Federal Grants for College

Going to a four-year college or university should be a goal for all American high school students. With a college degree, you can get better jobs and have more success in life. Higher-paying jobs also mean more tax money for the government. So, it benefits the United States to offer federal grants for college, making higher education accessible for everyone.

College is expensive, and not all families can afford it. The U.S. Department of Education says that four years of tuition and housing costs $51,216 at a public university and $128,736 at a private university. If tuition keeps rising, it could cost $70,166 for public and $160,920 for private by 2020. Online and vocational schools are cheaper but can still be too expensive. Luckily, federal grants are available for those who can't afford college but are determined and qualified.

The U.S. government offers four main grant programs to help pay for college:

1. **Pell Grant**: This grant is for low-income students who haven't earned their undergraduate degree yet. It's the largest and most popular federal grant. There's a whole article dedicated to it: Federal Pell Grant.

2. **Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)**: If you qualify for the Pell Grant, you might also get extra help through FSEOG. This grant is for students in extreme financial need. In 2010, it awarded nearly $960 million to over 1.3 million students, with awards ranging from $100 to $4,000. To qualify, you must meet the income requirements and attend a participating college. Your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) score from the FAFSA determines your need. In 2010, if your family's income was $31,000 or less, your EFC was zero, making you eligible for more aid.

3. **Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant**: Starting July 1, 2010, this grant helps children of military personnel who died in the Iraq or Afghanistan wars after September 11, 2001. If these students don't qualify for the Pell Grant based on income, they can get this grant, which equals the maximum Pell Grant amount, reduced if they attend part-time.

4. **Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant (TEACH)**: This grant is for those who want to become teachers in low-income areas. It offers up to $4,000 per year for four years of undergraduate study and two years of graduate study. You must commit to teaching in a subject with a shortage of qualified educators, like science, foreign language, or special education. If you can't fulfill this requirement, the grant turns into a loan that must be repaid.
