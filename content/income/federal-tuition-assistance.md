## Federal Tuition Assistance

The U.S. government offers several education assistance programs for members of the armed forces and the National Guard. These programs help veterans and active duty military pay for college, earn their GED, or complete certificate programs. It's important to understand the different options and what each one offers.

### Armed Forces Federal Tuition Assistance
The Armed Forces provide the Tuition Assistance (TA) Program for active duty soldiers. This program helps pay for education through federally accredited schools. To qualify, an officer must spend at least two years in the reserves. The program covers tuition for degrees higher than the officerâ€™s current education level. For example, someone with a bachelor's degree cannot use TA for an associate's degree in a different field.

The TA program covers up to $250 per semester hour, which is usually enough to pay for tuition at most schools. To use this program, soldiers must apply and get approval from the U.S. government education department.

### National Guard Reserves Assistance
The National Guard also offers education assistance. In addition to federal programs, most states have their own tuition assistance programs. The National Guard follows both federal and state rules, which can be stricter than those for the Armed Forces reserves. Generally, soldiers must commit to staying in the reserves for at least four years after finishing their courses.
