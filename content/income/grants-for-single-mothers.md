## Grants for Single Mothers: Your Path to Financial Support

Grants for single mothers may be the only way for you to raise money for college, pay off outstanding debts, or start a new business. Saving money as a single mother can be one of the most difficult things to do. With children as your primary focus, your time is limited. But what about taking care of yourself and meeting your goals?

### Ways to Raise Grant Money

Raising grant money can primarily be done in one of two ways. First, you can apply for a grant from your federal, state, or local government. These grants are usually issued for educational purposes, but there may be other ways that government grant money can be used. A second way to raise funds is by receiving grant money for single mothers offered by businesses and non-profits. These funds come from private institutions, so the conditions for the use of this money may be less strict than for government grants.

### State and Private Grants

Grants for single mothers aren't limited to just the federal government. Some states like New York offer a tuition assistance program (TAP) that gives you up to $5,000 if you live in the state. Kansas and New Mexico offer similar programs. Check with your state to see what types of programs are available.

Applying for private grants for single mothers is a bit different. You will need to contact the financial aid office at the school you're applying to. They will have a list of businesses and non-profit companies offering education grants. If your employer offers tuition reimbursement, this may also be a way for you to get assistance without applying for federal aid. Contact your human resources department for details. Some companies will offer assistance if you agree to pursue courses related to your company's industry or if you're getting an education to improve your skills used at the company.
