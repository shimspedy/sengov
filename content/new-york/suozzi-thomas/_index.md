Representative Tom Suozzi, trained as an attorney and CPA, is the Congressman representing the Third Congressional District in New York. He is a member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, the chief tax-writing committee of the House of Representatives, serving on both the Oversight and Tax Policy subcommittees. Congressman Suozzi is also the Vice-Chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and Co-Chair of the bipartisan Long Island Sound Caucus. In May of 2019, he was appointed to the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.

Congressman Suozzi previously served as mayor of his hometown, Glen Cove, NY from 1994-2001, and as Nassau County Executive from 2002-2009. As a reformer and a problem solver, in 2004 Suozzi created FixAlbany.com, exposing and rooting out corruption in New York state politics. In 2005, he was honored as Governing magazine’s “Public Official of the Year.”  In 2007, he was appointed by the Governor to lead a state commission that proposed the first property tax cap, which has now become law. In 2008, the New York State League of Conservation Voters (NYLCV) named him “Environmentalist of the Year.”

In 2010, Suozzi returned to the private sector as a senior advisor to investment banking firm Lazard and as of counsel at Harris Beach law firm.
