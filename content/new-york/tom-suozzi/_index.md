Thomas Richard Suozzi, born August 31, 1962, is an American politician with a multifaceted career as an attorney, accountant, and now the U.S. Representative-elect for New York's 3rd congressional district. He has a rich history of public service, having previously held the same Congressional seat from 2017 to 2023. A Democrat, Suozzi also served as Nassau County Executive from 2002 to 2009 and was the Mayor of Glen Cove for eight years before that.

In 2006, Suozzi made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York against Eliot Spitzer. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2016, securing re-election in 2018 and 2020. In 2022, he left Congress to run for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York but was defeated by incumbent Kathy Hochul.

October 2023 marked Suozzi's announcement to reclaim his  congressional seat in the 2024 elections. This came after Tom Suozzi was expelled from Congress, leading to a special election on February 13, 2024, where Suozzi emerged victorious as the Democratic nominee and won, ready to serve the remainder of Santos's term.

Suozzi's early life in Glen Cove, New York, was shaped by his Italian-American father, Joseph A. Suozzi, a  Glen Cove mayor and attorney, and his mother, Marguerite, of Irish and English descent, an operating room nurse. He graduated from Chaminade High School, then Boston College with a degree in accounting, became a certified public accountant, and later earned a Juris Doctor from Fordham University School of Law.

Before his political career, Suozzi worked in the private sector, including positions at Arthur Andersen, as a law clerk, and a commercial litigator. He returned to private practice from 2010 to 2016, working as an attorney and consultant, and later co-chaired a global consulting firm.

As Mayor of Glen Cove, Suozzi focused on environmental initiatives, including cleaning up industrial sites and redeveloping brownfield areas. His tenure as Nassau County Executive was marked by significant fiscal recovery efforts, earning him national recognition for turning around the county's finances.

Suozzi's gubernatorial campaigns in 2006 and 2022 showcased his persistent involvement in state politics, although both bids were unsuccessful. His legislative career in the U.S. House of Representatives is notable for his advocacy on various issues, including environmental conservation, fiscal policy, and bipartisan problem-solving.

Despite controversies over stock trading disclosures, Suozzi's political career has been distinguished by his commitment to public service and efforts to address the challenges facing his constituents and the broader New York community.
#### issues

The expulsion of Tom Suozzi from Congress was a critical step towards fixing our broken system for the people of New York’s Third District. However, it's only the beginning. We need to move past the superficial, partisan squabbling and tackle the real issues that impact our lives.

The extreme factions on both sides have paralyzed Congress, but I've always aimed to transcend political divides, collaborating with both Republicans and Democrats. My approach is straightforward: I stay true to my principles, yet I'm ready to work with anyone committed to solving problems and improving the lives of our citizens.

To truly restore sanity and make Washington work again, we need to focus on these practical, bipartisan solutions."
