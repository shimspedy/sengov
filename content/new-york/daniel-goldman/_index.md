Congressman Dan Goldman is an attorney who, before running for office, served as lead counsel in the first impeachment of former President Donald Trump and as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York. He has written about, and provided expert analysis on, significant topics ranging from criminal justice reform to the Special Counsel’s investigation. In law school, Goldman contributed to Michelle Alexander’s seminal book, The New Jim Crow, which addresses the inequalities in our criminal justice system.

As lead counsel in the first impeachment of Donald Trump, Goldman directed the strategy of the investigation and led the closed depositions and questioning of witnesses during the Intelligence Committee’s open hearings. He oversaw the drafting and publication of the Select Committee’s 300-page report on the investigation, ‘The Trump-Ukraine Impeachment Inquiry Report’, which exhaustively detailed Trump’s efforts to extort Ukraine for his personal benefit. Goldman also presented the Report in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee. Finally, he served as lead counsel for the House Impeachment Managers during the Senate trial of Donald Trump.

During his 10-year tenure as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, Goldman focused on organized crime and white collar prosecutions, representing the United States in all phases of the federal criminal process, from investigation through appeal. Goldman conducted and supervised hundreds of investigations involving racketeering, murder, money laundering, gun trafficking, firearms, narcotics, extortion and loansharking offenses, securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, health care fraud, tax fraud, and other white collar crime.

From 2012 to 2014, Goldman was Deputy Chief of the Organized Crime Unit. From 2014 to 2017, he served as Senior Trial Counsel in the Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force, during which time he prosecuted and convicted Billy Walters, a well-known sports gambler, for insider trading.

Goldman has also provided expert legal analysis on network and cable television, and was a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice in 2019.

Goldman has worked extensively with organizations dedicated to increasing opportunity and bolstering democracy, including LIFT Communities, the American Constitution Society, the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia Law School, Stanford Law School, and the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University, among others.

Goldman currently resides in lower Manhattan with his wife, Corinne, and their five children, who attend school in both the Manhattan and Brooklyn portions of the 10th District. He is a graduate of Yale College (B.A. 1998) and Stanford Law School (J.D. with distinction 2005). He clerked for the Hon. Charles R. Breyer in the Northern District of California and Robert D. Sack in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

#### About Dan Goldman
Dan Goldman and his wife, Corinne, live in lower Manhattan where they are raising their five children. In 2019, Dan Goldman served as lead counsel for the impeachment investigation of President Donald J. Trump for abusing his office for his personal interest regarding Ukraine. In that role, Goldman led depositions and questioned witnesses in public hearings, and testified before the House Judiciary Committee. 

Prior to that, Goldman served 10 years as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York working with Preet Bharara. In that role, he held powerful actors accountable and made our city safer. He took on some of the office’s biggest and most consequential cases: prosecuting violent gangs and gun trafficking, mafia bosses and Russian organized crime, and landmark insider trading and major corporate fraud cases. In law school, Goldman contributed to Michelle Alexander’s seminal book, The New Jim Crow, which addressed the inequalities in our criminal justice system.
