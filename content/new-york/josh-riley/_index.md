Josh Riley is from Endicott, New York, where his family spent generations working in the local factories, making shoes and boots at the Endicott-Johnson Shoe Corporation and circuit boards at IBM. When corrupt politicians and greedy corporations shipped those jobs overseas, Josh saw the American Dream slip away for many of his neighbors – so he dedicated his career to fighting for working-class neighborhoods like the one that raised him.

Josh served as a policy analyst at the U.S. Department of Labor, focused on helping communities that had been sold out by bad trade deals. After law school, Josh represented children from low-income families in a landmark civil rights case to improve access to affordable healthcare. Josh went on to serve as counsel on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, where he took on big corporations that exploited workers and consumers and brought together Democrats and Republicans to expand addiction treatment programs and combat the opioid epidemic.

In Congress, Josh is focused on giving working families a square deal in our economy and a voice in our politics. He’s working to rebuild the Middle Class by ending bad trade deals and bringing good manufacturing jobs back home, lowering costs and cutting taxes, and protecting Social Security and Medicare. Josh is a leading voice for campaign finance reform because he believes our politics should work for working families, not the special interests and their corporate PACs.

Josh lives in Ithaca with his wife, Monica, and their two young sons.
