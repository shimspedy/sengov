Carolyn Bosher Maloney, born on February 19, 1946, in Greensboro, North Carolina, is a former American politician who served as a U.S. Representative for three decades. Representing parts of Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn, she was known for her advocacy on economic policy, women's rights, and national security. She began her career as a teacher and later transitioned into public service, working in the New York State Legislature before being elected to the New York City Council in 1982. During her tenure on the council, she became the first woman to represent her district and introduced legislation that recognized domestic partnerships, including same-sex couples.

Elected to Congress in 1992, Maloney quickly became a leading voice on numerous legislative issues. She was instrumental in passing the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which provided aid to first responders affected by the September 11 attacks. She also championed consumer protection laws, such as the Credit CARD Act, and worked to ensure funding for processing DNA rape kits through the Debbie Smith Act. A staunch advocate for women's rights, she was the chief House sponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment and played a key role in establishing the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum.

Maloney made history as the first woman to chair the Joint Economic Committee and later the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. She remained a dedicated public servant until 2023 when she lost a Democratic primary to fellow incumbent Jerry Nadler due to redistricting. Despite her departure from Congress, she continued to be recognized for her contributions, including a tribute in the U.S. Capitol where a portrait of her in a firefighter jacket was unveiled, honoring her relentless work for 9/11 responders. Her legacy is defined by her commitment to progressive policies, legislative achievements, and advocacy for underrepresented communities.
