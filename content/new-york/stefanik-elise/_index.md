Congresswoman Elise Stefanik proudly represents New York’s 21st District and serves as the House Republican Conference Chair and most senior Republican in New York. In 2014, Elise successfully flipped a Democrat district to Republican winning by over 20 points. At the time of her first election, Elise was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress in United States history. She continued this historic rise and she is currently the youngest woman ever to serve in top elected House leadership. Elise is known for her tireless work ethic, policy leadership, media savvy, genuine grassroots connection with voters, and laser focus on delivering real results to her Upstate New York and North Country constituents. Elise has consistently won historic re-election victories, often by the largest margin of any Republican in the Northeast, and consistently earning the most votes in history for any Congressional candidate in the North Country.

Elise is one of President Trump’s staunchest allies in Congress. Hailed by President Trump as “a star,” Elise served on the House Intelligence Committee during the unconstitutional impeachment hearings and played a leading role as a member of President Trump’s impeachment defense team. She served as Co-Chair of New York, a top national surrogate for President Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign, and was proud to deliver a keynote primetime speech at the Republican National Convention in 2020. Elise is proud to be the highest-ranking official in Congress to endorse President Trump for President in 2024.

Elise is a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, the Committee on Education and Labor, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government. Elise has been rated as one of the most effective and bipartisan Members of Congress. She is a well-respected national policy leader on issues ranging from economic policy impacting small businesses and manufacturers to national security, intelligence reform and oversight, rural broadband, rural healthcare, constitutional protections, conservation, life, K-12 & higher education, cyber security, artificial intelligence, law enforcement, battlefield preservation, northern border issues, border security, & government accountability and transparency. 


Elise was born and raised in Upstate New York. Prior to serving in Congress, she worked at her family’s small business. Growing up in a small business family, Elise learned, lived, and understands the values of hard work, perseverance, determination, and grit. As the first member of her immediate family to have the opportunity to earn a college degree, Elise graduated with Honors from Harvard. From 2006 to 2009, Elise served in the West Wing of the White House on President George W. Bush’s Domestic Policy Council Staff and the Chief of Staff’s office where she assisted in overseeing the policy development process on all economic and domestic policy issues.

It is the highest and most humbling honor of Elise’s life to represent Upstate New York and the North Country in Congress.  She is proud to work tirelessly every day to bring a new generation of leadership to Washington on behalf of her district’s hardworking families, small businesses, farmers, students, seniors, service members, military families, law enforcement officers, and veterans. She is unapologetic about fighting every day to give her constituents a seat at the absolute highest levels of government.

Elise lives in Schuylerville with her husband Matt and their young son Sam. They are proud to call Upstate New York – the cradle of the American Revolution – home.
