Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is a rising star in the Republican Party and a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump. She represents New York's 21st Congressional District, which covers a large area of northern New York, including the Adirondack Mountains and parts of the Capital Region.

Stefanik was born in Albany, New York, on July 2, 1984, to a family of small business owners. She graduated from Harvard University with honors in 2006, and then worked in the White House under President George W. Bush. She also served as the director of vice-presidential debate preparation for Paul Ryan in 2012, and as the director of communications for the Foreign Policy Initiative, a conservative think tank.

Stefanik first ran for Congress in 2014, when she was 30 years old. She defeated the Democratic incumbent, Bill Owens, and became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at the time. She was re-elected in 2016, 2018, and 2020, winning by wide margins each time. She is a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, the House Education and Labor Committee, and the House Intelligence Committee. She also chairs the House Republican Conference, the fourth-highest position in the House Republican leadership, since May 2021.

Stefanik has been a vocal advocate for the military, especially for Fort Drum, which is located in her district. She has also championed issues such as rural broadband, health care, education, and agriculture. She has been rated as one of the most effective lawmakers in Congress by the Center for Effective Lawmaking.

Stefanik has also been a loyal ally of Trump, defending him during his first impeachment trial in 2019 and challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election in his favor. She was one of the 147 Republicans who voted to object to the certification of Joe Biden's victory on January 6, 2021, even after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. She has also endorsed controversial candidates such as George Santos, who has been accused of tax fraud and domestic violence.

Stefanik lives in Schuylerville, New York, with her husband, Matt Manda, and their son, Sam. She is the first woman to lead the House Republican Conference, and the youngest person ever to do so. She is widely seen as a potential future leader of the Republican Party and a possible candidate for higher office..
