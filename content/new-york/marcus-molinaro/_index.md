#### ABOUT MARC 
Congressman Marcus J. Molinaro was elected to serve New York’s 19th Congressional District in November 2022. The District includes Broome, Chenango, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Greene, Sullivan, Tioga, and Tompkins counties as well as part of Otsego County and Ulster County.

A native New Yorker, former Mayor, State Assemblyman, and County Executive, Marc is a career problem solver who ran for Congress to make Upstate New York a better place to live, work, and raise a family. 

In Congress, Marc serves on the House Committee on Agriculture, House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure, and the House Committee on Small Business. 

#### DEDICATED TO COMMUNITY
Marc began his career in public service in 1994 at the age of 18, when he was first elected to serve on the Village of Tivoli Board of Trustees. In 1995, he was elected Mayor of Tivoli, becoming the youngest mayor in America. Helping to revitalize his community, Marc was re-elected to this position five times. Concurrently, he served as a Dutchess County Legislator for four terms where he led efforts to strengthen his community’s response to child abuse and domestic violence. 

From 2006 to 2011, Marc continued his service in Albany, representing the 103rd District in the New York State Assembly. In 2011, Marc was elected to serve as Dutchess County Executive. Marc served three terms as County Executive and held a leadership role in the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC) and served as President of the New York State County Executives Association. Marc resigned as Dutchess County Executive in 2023 to serve in Congress. 

Throughout his career, Marc has taken bold action to deliver results for Upstate New York. After identifying shortcomings in the Dutchess County criminal justice system, Marc revamped its programming and reprioritized prevention, intervention, diversion, and enforcement. As a lifelong champion for conservation, Marc advanced preservation efforts of farmlands, waterways, and local environmental treasures. 

Marc has also been known for developing innovative solutions to local issues. In 2015, Marc established “ThinkDIFFERENTLY”. The program challenged Dutchess County residents, businesses, and municipalities to break down barriers for those with physical, intellectual and developmental disabilities. Additionally, Marc implemented a comprehensive approach to healthcare in Dutchess County, notably spearheading initiatives that expanded access to mental health services. 

#### THE MOLINARO FAMILY
Marc resides in Upstate New York with his wife Corinne and children Abigail, Jack, Elias, and Theo.

Marc remains active in the Upstate New York community and has received numerous awards from community and civic organizations for his service.


#### Why I'm Running
New York and America are at a crossroads, with every decision having a profound and lasting impact for years to come. Do we continue to follow the tired, hackneyed ways of doing things in Washington, the same status quo, or do we have the courage, capacity and character to create the vision of our state and country for which we’ve longed? I’ve made my decision: I’ve decided to dedicate myself to the people of New York and seek to represent you in Congress.

From my days as a teen-aged village trustee and youngest mayor in America, through my career in the New York State Assembly, and now, nearly a decade as Dutchess County Executive, I’ve continually worked to mold consensus and tirelessly serve the residents I’ve represented - my neighbors who’ve entrusted me with their confidence to serve their community with their best interest at heart. It’s a sacred trust I’ve long embraced, a pact I’m honored to live up to each day.

Our community needs a proven leader in the House of Representatives, one with a track record of working to find solutions, not stoke the deep division that continues to keep our state and nation from reaching its fullest. For more than a quarter-century, I’ve earned the trust of New Yorkers by unifying people of different backgrounds and ideas to bring about a greater good for the people I’ve served. I’ve done it in the Hudson Valley. I’ve done it in Albany.

I will do it again in Washington.

The son of a mother who, for some time, raised a young family on her own, I know the value of hard work and determination. The father of four children, including one on the autism spectrum, I know the importance of family, giving your all for your loved ones no matter the personal sacrifice. A public servant since 1995, I’ve spent my adult life dedicated to working for my community, always delivering results for those I’ve served.

The past year-and-a-half, these most challenging times of our lifetimes, have called for great leadership, and never has the ability to bring accord been more valuable; it has literally been a matter of life and death. I know all too well the human loss this pandemic has brought to our community, our state, and our nation. In light of such grave consequences, I’m running for the future of our community -- the health, safety, and well-being of my neighbors -- and to help New York and America rebound and fulfill the ideal of our state and country for which we’ve longed.

I’m running for the future of my children and yours; for employees who have struggled like never before to maintain the American dream; for small business owners whose ambitions and livelihoods have been ravaged; for those who have been marginalized, left out, and relegated to the sidelines for too long. I’m running to make NY-19 a better place in which to live, work, and raise a family.

I’m running because I believe in America and Americans. I believe in our exceptionalism-- our capacity and the need to restore our shining city on a hill. I’m running for us--we, the people. 

I hope you’ll run alongside me, stride for stride, step by step -- for the finish line is in sight, and we will cross it together.

#### Meet Marc
Marc was first elected to public office at the age of 18 in 1994, serving on the Village of Tivoli Board of Trustees. In 1995, he became the youngest mayor in the United States.  He was re-elected mayor five times and elected four times to the Dutchess County Legislature. In 2006, he brought his passion for public service to Albany when elected to represent the 103rd District in the New York State Assembly.  Now, as County Executive, Marc serves as Second Vice President for the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC). 

Marc has been an innovator in New York, establishing a holistic approach to dealing with residents’ health. By combining the former Department of Health and Department of Mental Hygiene and creating  the Department of Behavioral and Community Health (DBCH), Marc focused on the community’s health as a whole-- taking into account every individual’s physical and mental health. This inclusive approach to providing the appropriate health care to Dutchess County has proven effective and continues to improve the lives of community members every day.  

In the same spirit of inclusive care, Marc established “ThinkDIFFERENTLY” in 2015. This program is a call to action, a challenge for Dutchess County residents to look at the potential in their neighbors with special needs instead of dwelling on their differences. “ThinkDIFFERENTLY” asks individuals, businesses, communities and municipalities to break down barriers for residents with special needs. In 2016, Marc appointed Dutchess County’s Deputy Commissioner for Special Needs, the first such position in New York State. The Deputy Commissioner for Special Needs serves as an advocate for individuals and families with special needs and abilities, providing personalized support to everyone who needs it . Marc has also brought his “ThinkDIFFERENTLY” message statewide, holding forums across New York State to encourage other communities to embrace the initiative; more than 100 communities across New York State and even across the nation have since adopted “ThinkDIFFERENTLY” resolutions, showing their support for residents of all abilities.

Marc also works hard to protect our physical surroundings. He has been a leader on Open Space Protection and Farmland Preservation, an advocate to preserve the Hudson River Valley Greenway and a supporter of the Greenway Compact.  In 2013, the New York State Senate appointed him to the Greenway Heritage Conservancy for the Hudson River Valley.  In 2014, Marc was honored by the Pace University Land Use Law Center as the recipient of its Groundbreaker’s Award given to a graduate of the Center's Land Use Leadership Alliance (LULA) Training Program.

Another of Marc’s defining accomplishments is the development of Dutchess County’s revamped comprehensive criminal justice system. The innovative system is based on prevention, intervention, diversion and transition – a structure which can be a model for America. Dutchess County’s Mobile Crisis Intervention Team, crisis intervention training, evidence-based alternatives to incarceration, and an array of transitional programs have been successful and can be replicated by counties throughout the nation.

Marc has been active in numerous community and civic organizations.  In 2010, he was honored with the VV Anderson Award for Community Service by the Anderson Center for Autism.  In 2011, Astor Services for Children and Families presented him with the Louise Marillac Public Service Award in recognition of the work he has done on behalf of children and families in the community.  In 2014, Marc received the Champion for Elder Rights and Safety Award from the Coalition on Elder Abuse in Dutchess County.  In 2015, he was honored for outstanding leadership by the Mid-Hudson Chapter of the American Red Cross, and was named the Distinguished Citizen of the Year by the Boy Scouts of America, Hudson Valley Council. The New York State Rehabilitation Association honored Marc as the 2016 Public Official of the Year, and Taconic Resources for Independence recognized him for his successful “ThinkDIFFERENTLY” efforts at the organization’s 30th anniversary celebration.  He was also honored with the 2017 Catherine Seeberger Citizenship Award by The Arc of Dutchess.  

Molinaro is a graduate of Dutchess Community College, where he earned a Dutchess United Educators award, and the PACE Land Use Law Center Community Leadership Alliance.  He has been recognized by the Greater Southern Dutchess Chamber of Commerce and “Capitol” news publication as one of their first “Forty under Forty” leaders. The Albany Times Union cited him as one of Albany’s “True Reformers,” the Hudson Register Star recognized him as a “strong advocate,” and the Poughkeepsie Journal called Molinaro a “voice of reason."   Hudson Valley Magazine readers have voted Molinaro “Best Politician” in the Hudson Valley region seven times. 

County Executive Molinaro lives in Red Hook with his wife Corinne and children Abigail, Jack, Eli, and Theo.
