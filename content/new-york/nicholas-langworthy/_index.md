Nick Langworthy has dedicated his life to fighting for a strong and prosperous America. Throughout his career, he has worked to protect our constitutional rights and the values that make America the greatest country in the world.

As a native son of the Southern Tier, Nick Langworthy grew up in South Dayton, New York where he proudly graduated from Pine Valley Central School. The son of a small business owner in Jamestown, he learned firsthand the value of a hard day’s work and how the role of government can either help or hurt the private sector.

After graduating from Niagara University, he recommitted his dedication to Western New York and took his passion for public service to serve in the district office of former Congressman and NRCC Chairman Tom Reynolds. It was there he learned not only the inner-workings of Congress, but how to deliver first-class constituent service to the people of Western New York. After Reynolds retirement, Nick served as District Director for succeeding Congressman Chris Lee.

Langworthy wanted to take his drive to protect taxpayers even further and was elected to serve as the Erie County Republican Chairman where he helped elect strong leaders to every level of government. His influence and leadership in New York State has earned him recognition in Buffalo Business First Magazine’s “Power 250” ranking of Western New York’s most influential people every single year from 2013 to 2019. He also has been included in City and State Magazine’s list of New York State’s “Power 100” and was named one of their “40 under 40” in 2017.

Langworthy immediately set out on a mission to rebuild, retool, and revitalize the New York Republican Party. He ushered in a new fighting spirit that led the charge to force Cuomo from office, stop non-citizen voting, defeat Democrats’ gerrymandering scheme and countless other issues important to New York taxpayers. Since becoming Chairman, New York’s Republican congressional delegation has grown and Republicans have won new seats in every corner of the state.

Following his successful election in 2016, President Donald J. Trump named Langworthy to the executive committee of his transition team. In 2019, President Trump called on Langworthy to lead the New York State Republican party, making him the youngest person to lead the Party in its history.

Langworthy has proven he doesn’t just know how to fight – he knows how to win. He is running for Congress to stop the disastrous Biden-Pelosi agenda. He will fight against the reckless spending that is causing 40-year record inflation, rein in out-of-control gas prices by unleashing American energy and will restore law and order to our communities by backing the blue and securing our border. He will be an unwavering defender of our US Constitution and protecting the Second Amendment.

Nick and his wife Erin are parents of a young daughter, and he knows there is no more important task than protecting the American Dream for the next generation. He wants to ensure that his family and yours can live prosperously, freely and safely in Western New York for generations to come.
