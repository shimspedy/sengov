Congressman John W. Mannion represents New York’s 22nd Congressional District including the communities of Syracuse, Utica, Oneida, Auburn, and Cortland. He represents all of Onondaga and Madison Counties and parts of Oneida, Cayuga, and Cortland Counties.

A lifelong resident of Central New York, Congressman Mannion spent nearly three decades teaching high school science, including Advanced Placement Biology and Chemistry. As the West Genesee Teachers’ Association president for eight years, he represented 400 teachers and nurses during two successful contract negotiations. The congressman is a graduate of the SUNY System, attending Binghamton and Oswego.

As a New York State Senator, Mannion served as the founding Chairman of the Senate Committee on Disabilities. He secured four consecutive cost of living increases for Direct Support Professionals and expanded the preferred source program to boost employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities. He also authored legislation requiring a report by New York State’s Office for Persons with Developmental Disabilities on the agency’s pandemic response, and he prioritized solutions to address critical workforce and housing shortages.

In the State Senate, Mannion championed efforts to bring new jobs to Central New York, fighting to pass the historic Green Chips legislation that provides low-cost power to the computer chip industry in New York. Micron has pointed to this meaningful legislation as a determining factor in its decision to invest $100B in Mannion’s district to build a Chip Fab in Clay, NY. Mannion also passed bills to create the Upstate Flood Mitigation Task Force and establish the first new police force in the state in fifty years at the Syracuse Regional Airport Authority. Throughout his time in Albany, he secured over $5 million for critical workforce development programs and passed into law some of the strongest reproductive health care protections in the country.

Congressman Mannion is a lifelong Central New Yorker and the grandchild of Irish immigrants. His mother worked at New York Telephone and his father for New York Central Railroad, raising John on Syracuse's famous Tipperary Hill. He now resides in Geddes with his wife of twenty-seven years, Jennifer. She has worked for over twenty-five years as an elementary teacher and reading interventionist, while raising their three children.
