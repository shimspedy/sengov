Senator Chuck Schumer is the Democratic leader of the U.S. Senate and the senior senator from New York. He is a tireless fighter for the middle class and a champion of progressive values and policies.

Senator Schumer was born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 23, 1950, to a family of modest means. He graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, and then returned to his hometown to pursue a career in public service. He was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1974, at the age of 23, and then to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980, representing Brooklyn and Queens.

Senator Schumer was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998, defeating the incumbent Republican senator, Alfonse D'Amato. He was re-elected in 2004, 2010, and 2016, winning by large margins each time. He became the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2005, and helped elect a Democratic majority in the Senate in 2006 and 2008. He also served as the vice chair of the Democratic Conference and the chair of the Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. He became the Senate minority leader in 2017, succeeding Harry Reid, and the Senate majority leader in 2021, after the Democrats won two runoff elections in Georgia.

Senator Schumer is a leader on a wide range of issues, such as:

- **Economy and Jobs**: Senator Schumer is committed to creating a fairer and more prosperous economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful. He supports raising the minimum wage, ensuring equal pay for equal work, strengthening workers' rights and unions, expanding small business opportunities, and providing tax relief for the middle class and working families. He also supports investing in infrastructure, transportation, and broadband to create jobs and improve the quality of life in New York and across the country.

- **Health Care**: Senator Schumer believes that health care is a human right and that everyone should have access to quality, affordable, and comprehensive health care. He supports strengthening and expanding the Affordable Care Act, protecting Medicare and Medicaid, lowering prescription drug prices, and ensuring reproductive rights and justice. He also champions mental health, dental health, and women's health issues.

- **Education**: Senator Schumer is a strong advocate for public education and for providing students with the resources and opportunities they need to succeed. He supports increasing federal funding for education, reducing class sizes, improving teacher training and retention, expanding early childhood education, and making college more accessible and affordable. He also supports investing in STEM education, arts education, and bilingual education.

- **Environment**: Senator Schumer is a fierce defender of the environment and a leader in fighting climate change. He supports the American Jobs Plan, a bold and comprehensive plan to transition the U.S. to a clean energy economy and create millions of green jobs. He also supports rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, restoring environmental protections, and promoting environmental justice and sustainability.

- **Immigration**: Senator Schumer is a proud son of immigrants and a champion of immigrant rights and dignity. He supports comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., protects Dreamers and TPS holders, reunites families, and reforms the immigration system to make it more fair and humane. He also opposes the Trump administration's cruel and racist immigration policies, such as the Muslim ban, the border wall, and family separation.

- **National Security and Foreign Policy**: Senator Schumer is a respected voice on national security and foreign policy issues. He supports a smart and principled foreign policy that advances the U.S. interests and values, promotes peace and stability, and strengthens our alliances and partnerships. He also supports a robust and responsible national defense that protects the American people and honors the sacrifices of our veterans and service members. He is a vocal advocate for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law around the world, especially in the Middle East.
