Congresswoman Laura Gillen is currently serving her first term in Congress representing the people of New York’s Fourth Congressional District. The district includes Nassau County’s South Shore. Congresswoman Gillen is a Baldwin native and lives with her family in Rockville Centre. 

Congresswoman Gillen graduated from Sacred Heart Academy and was a George Baker Scholar at Georgetown University. Her participation in the Baker Scholar program impacted the direction of her life with its lessons of leadership and community service. After graduating, Congresswoman Gillen volunteered on the front lines of the AIDS crisis and in Mother Teresa’s Home for the Dying in Kolkata. Upon her return home, the Congresswoman attended law school at Georgetown Law Center and NYU School of Law, later working as a litigator with Cahill Gordon & Reindel, LLP, where she participated in her firm’s pro bono program where she represented victims of domestic violence. She later joined the Westerman firm in Nassau County.

In 2017, Congresswoman Gillen became the first Democrat to be elected Hempstead Town Supervisor in 112 years. Congresswoman Gillen took aim at waste and corruption and made the Town government more accessible, transparent and accountable to taxpayers. As Supervisor, Congresswoman Gillen led efforts to revitalize the town’s infrastructure, brought taxes down for residents, took on special interests to recover damages for contaminants in the public water supply and passed critical legislation relating to sexual harassment and veterans’ benefits.

In Congress, Rep. Gillen serves on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, sitting on the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, Subcommittee on Aviation, and Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, and the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.
