A born and raised Ohioan, Dave Taylor is a conservative businessman and attorney who proudly represents Ohio’s Second District in the U.S. House of Representatives and understands the importance of getting the job done.

Dave attended Amelia High School and went on to graduate from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and earn his Juris Doctorate degree from the Dayton School of Law. With his law degree in hand, Dave joined the Clermont County Prosecutor’s Office where he held criminals accountable for drugs and violence in his hometown.

Having spent years successfully trying criminal cases, Dave returned to work for his family’s small business where he ultimately served as President, employing two dozen Ohioans.

A member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Dave is committed to ensuring the safety and development of infrastructure in rural Ohio. Dave is also a member of the House Agriculture Committee, where he is eager to support legislation that bolsters Ohio’s agriculture industry and supports local farmers, ranchers, and producers.

Dave’s top priority is delivering results to Ohio’s Second District through representing conservative values and ensuring the needs of hardworking families come first.

Dave and his wife of 28 years, Charity, have three girls and reside in Clermont County.
