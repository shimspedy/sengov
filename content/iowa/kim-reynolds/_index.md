#### About the Governor
Governor Kim Reynolds Seated at Desk
Governor Kim Reynolds is the 43 rd governor of Iowa and has the distinction of being the first woman elected to the state’s highest office in November 2018.

Governor Reynolds has a long-standing record of public service, having served four terms as Clarke County Treasurer before being elected to the Iowa Senate in November 2008.

#### About the First Gentleman
Kevin Reynolds was born in Osceola, Iowa, and grew up on a 500-acre family farm in southern Warren County. His father, Burdette, was a paratrooper during the Korean War. His mother, Ramona, raised their six children and was a passionate gardener. During his childhood, Kevin developed a life-long passion for the outdoors. In his high school years, he met Kim Strawn, who would later become his wife. 

Kevin earned his bachelor’s degree from Iowa State University in Agronomy. His first job was with the County of Pottawattamie in soil and water conservation. He was a County Resource Planner. Kevin went on to work at the U.S. Department of Agriculture first as a Soil Conservationist and later as a District Conservationist. His career responsibilities took him to Mount Pleasant and Leon, Iowa. After 36 years of service, he retired in March 2017.

He made history in his state as First Gentleman when his wife, Kim Reynolds, became Governor of Iowa. In his new role, Kevin is keenly focused on preserving and enhancing Terrace Hill (the Governor’s Mansion) for future generations of Iowans to enjoy. 

As an avid outdoorsman, Kevin also continues to deeply care about soil health and water quality. As First Gentleman, he is actively engaged in educating Iowans of all ages about the state’s many treasured natural resources.

Kevin and his wife, Kim, married on April 3, 1982. Their three daughters (Jennifer, Nicole and Jessica) are happily married. The Reynolds family has 11 grandchildren.
