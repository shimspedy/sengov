His Company saw some of the worst fighting of the Iraq War, losing 22 Marines and a Navy Corpsman to enemy action in eight months.

He has also ensured that U.S. Forces in Korea – the front line of our defense against North Korea – remain a credible deterrent force. With the passage of his NDAA amendments, he has led the response to companies like Huawei and ZTE, state-directed organizations that threaten our national security and our next generation infrastructure. He believes in retaining the United States’ qualitative military edge and in employing U.S. military power only when necessary.

As a member of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, Representative Gallego works to improve the health and wellbeing of as well as the economic and educational opportunities for veterans by improving care – including mental health care – and oversight at the VA, investing in cutting-edge veterans education and career support programs, and ensuring that all veterans can access the benefits they’ve earned. Rep. Gallego has also championed funding to address veterans’ homelessness in the Phoenix area and across the country, an issue he has been passionate about since he first worked with homeless veterans at a non-profit after leaving the service himself.

Congressman Gallego is also a member of the House Natural Resources Committee and the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States (SCIP), where he has fought to uphold Tribal sovereignty and our federal trust responsibility to Native Americans and Alaska Natives. As the former Chairman of SCIP, he held the first-ever House hearing on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, led the fight to protect sacred spaces and affirm Tribal Nations’ right to sovereign homelands, and championed investment in broadband and other critical infrastructure on Tribal land. In addition, he has used his platform on the Natural Resources Committee to advocate for stronger federal land and wildlife conservation laws, public lands policy that combats climate change, and improved public access to America’s iconic public lands.
