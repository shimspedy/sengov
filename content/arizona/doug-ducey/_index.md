Doug Ducey is committed to expanding opportunity for all Arizonans – and as a successful businessman, he’s brought much-needed change to Arizona government.

Doug came to Arizona in 1982 to attend Arizona State University, where he graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Finance. After graduation he worked for Procter & Gamble and ultimately landed at Cold Stone Creamery, where he helped grow a small company to one with over 1,440 locations around the world. He and his partners sold the company in 2007.

Alarmed by deficit spending and the growth of government, Doug ran for public office to make a difference, first as Arizona State Treasurer and then as Arizona’s 23rd Governor.

Building on his business experience, Doug took a $1 billion deficit in his first year and balanced the budget – without raising taxes.

He believes in the importance of education, and led an historic, bi-partisan effort to inject $3.5 billion into Arizona’s K-12 schools, helping boost teacher pay and put more money in the classroom — again, all without raising taxes.

He’s cut regulations to stimulate jobs and has reduced taxes every year. In addition, Doug launched Arizona’s Border Strike Force, a partnership with local, state and federal law enforcement to enhance security along Arizona’s southern border, targeting drug cartels and human traffickers.

Doug is proud of his administration’s work to reduce/eliminate the backlog of untested rape kits, and proactive measures to help people fight drug addiction and get a second chance in their lives.

He and his wife, Angela, live in Paradise Valley with their three sons, Jack, Joe and Sam.
