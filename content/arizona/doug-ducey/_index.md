     greeting: contact Governor Doug Ducey 
     description: GGovernor Ducey was born in Toledo, Ohio. He moved to Arizona in 1982 to attend Arizona State University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Finance. He and his wife, Angela, live in Paradise Valley with their three sons, Jack, Joe and Sam. He is Arizona’s 23rd governor. Elected in 2014, and re-elected in 2018, Governor Ducey applied his experience from a successful career in business to bring much-needed change to Arizona government. Committed to investing in public education, Governor Ducey led a historic and bipartisan effort to invest $3.5 billion into K-12 schools in his first year, injecting more dollars into Arizona’s classrooms. With a focus on teacher pay, the governor also successfully championed the passage of legislation to increase teacher pay 20 percent by 2020. Governor Ducey cut regulations and simplified taxes to stimulate job creation and economic growth. He also prioritized public safety, creating the Arizona Border Strike Force, a statewide, multi-agency effort to combat border-related crime.
