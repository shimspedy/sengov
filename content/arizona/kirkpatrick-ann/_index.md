#### Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick
Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick was born and raised in rural Arizona, moved to Tucson to attend the University of Arizona, and has performed a lifetime of service for Arizona families. She worked as a prosecutor, starting her career in the Pima County Attorney’s office, before going on to serve in Congress. She represents a diverse district that stretches from the suburbs of Tucson to the more rural border towns in Cochise County.

As a member of the influential Appropriations Committee, Ann has crafted a legislative agenda driven by the needs of her constituents. With a focus on accessible healthcare, affordable higher education, building a robust infrastructure, addressing climate change, and advocating for the district’s competitive defense industry, Ann has prioritized bipartisan reforms that directly impact the families, businesses and communities she is honored to represent.

Ann and her husband, Roger, live in the Casas Adobes neighborhood in Tucson and spend their free time babysitting their three energetic grandchildren.
