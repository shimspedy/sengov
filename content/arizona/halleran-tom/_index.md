Growing up, Tom O'Halleran was taught the value of hard work and honesty in serving his community. He took these lessons and joined the Chicago Police Department where he was commissioned as one of the youngest homicide detectives in the city's history. He served with distinction, receiving countless commendations and awards for his work to serve and protect his community.

Following his service, Tom became a member of the Chicago Board of Trade and opened his own small business. As a member of the board of directors, he chaired the finance, floor operations, and planning committees. His work gave the Board of Trade a vision for the future.

Never one to rest, Tom took on public service once again upon retiring to Arizona. He served three consecutive terms in the Arizona House of Representatives and one term in the Senate. Tom used his eight years in the legislature to take on tough challenges and make the right decisions for his constituents, regardless of the political implications. For Tom, it is, and will always be, about the people he serves, not party or title.

Tom and his wife, Pat, live in unincorporated Yavapai County outside the Village of Oak Creek. They celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2019 and have three children and four grandchildren.
