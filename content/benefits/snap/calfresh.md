### Disaster CalFresh General Eligibility Requirements

#### What is Disaster CalFresh?

Disaster CalFresh provides temporary food assistance to households affected by natural disasters. It is also known as the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP).

#### Who can qualify?

To qualify for Disaster CalFresh, a household must meet all of the following criteria:

1. **Residency**: The household must have lived in the disaster area at the time of the disaster.

2. **Adverse Effects**: The household must have experienced one of the following adverse effects:
   - Damage to or destruction of the home or self-employment business.
   - Disaster-related expenses not expected to be reimbursed during the disaster benefit period (e.g., temporary shelter expenses, evacuation expenses, home/business repairs, disaster-related personal injury including funeral expenses).
   - Loss or inaccessibility of income including a reduction, termination, or delay in receipt of income for a significant portion of the disaster benefit period.
   - Inaccessibility of liquid resources (e.g., banks are closed due to the disaster).

3. **Purchase of Food**: The household must plan on purchasing food during the disaster benefit period.

## What are the financial eligibility criteria?

The household’s income and resources, minus a deduction for disaster-related expenses, must be under the disaster gross income limit.

To be eligible for Disaster CalFresh, you must:

have lived or worked in one of the affected counties during the time of the disaster. 

### Additional information

#### CalFresh is Safe for You and Your Family!

Getting CalFresh will not affect your immigration status or your chances of obtaining legal permanent residency in the future. For more information about immigration and public benefits, visit [keepyourbenefits.org](https://www.keepyourbenefits.org) or text the word "benefits" to 650-376-8006. You’ll be able to use a free immigration screening tool from the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo. This tool is anonymous and confidential and will ask you a few general questions to provide specific guidance.

#### Which Immigrants Can Get CalFresh?

Many immigrants can qualify for CalFresh. A household can get CalFresh if at least one person (including children):

- Has citizenship.
- Has a green card (for any length of time).
- Has refugee or asylum status.
- Has parolee status for at least one year (Ukrainian parolees may qualify before one year).
- Has, or is applying for, a U-Visa or T-Visa.
- Is an applicant for VAWA (Violence Against Women Act) relief.
- Is a Cuban or Haitian entrant.
- Is an Afghan entering with a special Immigrant VISA (SIV), (SQ/SI) Parole, or other forms of humanitarian parole.
- Is Hmong/Laotian or American Indian born in Canada.

An individual does not qualify for CalFresh if they:

- Are here on a student, work, or tourist visa.
- Are here under DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals).
- Are here under TPS (Temporary Protected Status), unless they meet other qualifying factors.
- Are undocumented.

If you are not eligible because of your immigration status, you can apply on behalf of other household members, like U.S. born children.

If your immigration status isn’t listed here, consult a local expert on public benefits and immigration. Immigrants who can get CalFresh benefits still need to meet the regular CalFresh income guidelines.

#### What If Some People in My Household Qualify and Others Don’t?

Many households have members who qualify and others who don’t. Make sure to include everyone in your household on your application—CalFresh will only grant benefits to those who qualify. The information you provide is used solely to determine if your household qualifies for CalFresh and will not be shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

#### Am I Eligible for Benefits If I Just Got My Green Card?

Yes, new green-card holders are eligible for benefits immediately. There is no 5-year waiting period to receive CalFresh benefits in California. You can apply as soon as you get your green card, and receiving CalFresh will not be counted against you in citizenship determinations.

#### What Happens After I Submit My Application?

After submitting your application, your local CalFresh office may contact you to schedule an interview. An interview may not be required if you submitted proof of ID for everyone in your household and any other necessary documents. An interview is required if your case worker has questions about your application or needs more documents. If you are missing any documents, the case worker will inform you of what to submit.

#### What Documents Will I Need to Provide to Get CalFresh?

These documents are typically required to get CalFresh:

- A copy of your ID (e.g., driver’s license, consular ID, passport).
- Proof of any income from the last 30 days (e.g., paystubs, a letter explaining how much you earn).
- For college students: a copy of the financial aid award letter and class schedule.

Immigrants may also need to provide proof of status to receive benefits:

- A copy of your green card (both sides).
- A copy of your most recent paperwork for a U Visa, T Visa, Asylum, Refugee or Parolee status, or VAWA petition.
- Naturalized U.S. Citizens may need to provide a copy of their U.S. passport or naturalization papers.

If you are only applying for other household members, you don’t need to provide proof of your immigration status.

Optional documents that can increase your benefit amount include:

- Proof of housing expenses, like rent costs.
- Proof of child support paid.
- Proof of medical expenses for people who are 60+ and/or have a disability.

If you can’t get the proof, tell your case worker during your CalFresh applicant interview. CalFresh will generally accept a sworn statement as a last resort if you cannot get the necessary documents.

#### If Someone in My Family Is Undocumented, Can I Still Apply for CalFresh?

Yes, you can apply for CalFresh even if someone in your family is undocumented. Here are some key points:

- As of March 9, 2021, CalFresh is not considered for public charge. This means that getting CalFresh will not be counted against you when you apply for a green card or citizenship.
- It is common for an undocumented parent to apply for children who have citizenship or eligible immigrant status.
- CalFresh will not share information with ICE.
- Benefits used by children or other household members are not counted against undocumented family members.

Be honest about your immigration situation (and everything else) when applying for CalFresh. Remember, you do not have to provide proof of immigration status for anyone who is not applying for benefits for themselves.

#### Can I Apply If Everyone in My Household Is Undocumented?

No, undocumented individuals are not eligible for CalFresh. However, if you are undocumented and have children or other household members who have citizenship or eligible immigrant status, you can apply for them.

Some immigrants, like green card holders (legal permanent residents), U or T visa applicants, and survivors of human trafficking, may be eligible for CalFresh before they have Social Security numbers. They can still receive CalFresh, so be sure your case worker knows if they want to be included.

You can also contact your local food bank for more information about community food help.

#### Does Getting CalFresh Hurt My Immigration Status or Make Me a Public Charge?

No! As of March 9, 2021, CalFresh is not considered a public charge program. This means that getting CalFresh will not be counted against you when you apply for a green card or citizenship. CalFresh is safe to use and won’t impact your status.

#### Does Getting CalFresh Affect My Ability to Get Citizenship or a Green Card?

No! As of March 9, 2021, CalFresh is not considered a public charge program. This means that getting CalFresh will not be counted against you when you apply for a green card or citizenship.

#### How Will My Personal Information Be Used?

If you are applying for benefits only for another person in your family or household, you do not have to share your immigration status with CalFresh. The CalFresh office may share information with other government agencies like Health and Human Services and the Social Security Administration, only to see if you qualify for benefits, with limited exceptions. CalFresh will not share information with ICE.
