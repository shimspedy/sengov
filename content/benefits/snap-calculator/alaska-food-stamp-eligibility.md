### SNAP Eligibility in Alaska

There are three eligibility tests for SNAP: the Gross Income, Net Income, and Asset tests. Depending on your state and whether your household includes a member who is 60 or older or has a disability, your household may be exempt from these tests.

While the Gross Income and Asset tests are straightforward, Net Income is more complex to calculate. We recommend using our SNAP Eligibility Calculator to see if you qualify for SNAP benefits.

#### Gross Income Limits
Total monthly household income before taxes, including job, self-employment, and other income like social security, disability, child support, worker's comp, unemployment, and pension income.

| Household Size | Gross Monthly Income Limit |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| 1 person       | $1,973                      |
| 2 people       | $2,670                      |
| 3 people       | $3,367                      |
| 4 people       | $4,062                      |
| 5 people       | $4,759                      |
| 6 people       | $5,456                      |
| 7 people       | $6,152                      |
| Each additional person | +$696               |

The gross income limit is 130% of the federal poverty level.

#### Expanded Income Limits for Households with Members 60 or Older or with a Disability
There is no gross income limit in Alaska for households with a member who is 60 or older or has a disability.

#### Net Income Limits
Net income is a household's gross income minus deductions.

Calculating net income can be complex, as shelter-related expenses (utilities and rent) can only be deducted if they exceed half the household's income after other deductions. Additionally, there is a limit on the maximum shelter deduction for some households.

SNAP benefit amounts are based on a household's net income. Generally, $100 more in net income equals $30 less in benefits.

| Household Size | Net Monthly Income Limit |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| 1 person       | $1,518                   |
| 2 people       | $2,054                   |
| 3 people       | $2,590                   |
| 4 people       | $3,125                   |
| 5 people       | $3,661                   |
| 6 people       | $4,197                   |
| 7 people       | $4,733                   |
| Each additional person | +$536            |

The net income limit is 100% of the federal poverty level.

#### Asset/Resource Limit
Countable resources include funds in bank accounts. A home is not counted as a resource.

| Household Type                  | Asset Limit |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| Households with a member 60 or older or with a disability | $4,250 |
| All other households            | $2,750      |
