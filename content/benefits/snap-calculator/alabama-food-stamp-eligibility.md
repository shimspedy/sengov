**SNAP Eligibility in Alabama**

To qualify for SNAP in Alabama, households must pass three tests: the Gross Income, Net Income, and Asset tests. Exemptions from these tests may apply if a household member is 60 or older or has a disability, depending on state-specific regulations.

Alabama has expanded its SNAP eligibility criteria beyond the federal standards, which may result in differing financial requirements on various websites compared to what is outlined here.

**Gross Income Limits:**
Gross income includes all pre-tax household income such as wages, self-employment earnings, and other sources like social security, disability, child support, worker's compensation, unemployment benefits, and pensions. Households with members 60 or older or with disabilities must meet the gross income test only if their assets exceed $4250.

| Household Size | Gross Income Limit (130% FPL) | Expanded Income Limit (200% FPL) |
|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $1579/month                   | $2430/month                     |
| 2 people       | $2137/month                   | $3288/month                     |
| 3 people       | $2693/month                   | $4144/month                     |
| 4 people       | $3250/month                   | $5000/month                     |
| 5 people       | $3807/month                   | $5858/month                     |
| 6 people       | $4364/month                   | $6714/month                     |
| 7 people       | $4920/month                   | $7570/month                     |
| Each additional person | +$557/month           | +$858/month                     |

**Net Income Limits:**
Net income is determined by subtracting allowable deductions from the gross income. Deductions can include expenses like rent, utilities, and medical costs. Calculating net income can be complex, so using a SNAP Eligibility Calculator is recommended.

Only households with members 60 or older or with disabilities whose gross income exceeds 130% of the federal poverty level need to meet the net income test.

| Household Size | Net Income Limit (100% FPL)   |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $1215/month                   |
| 2 people       | $1644/month                   |
| 3 people       | $2072/month                   |
| 4 people       | $2500/month                   |
| 5 people       | $2929/month                   |
| 6 people       | $3357/month                   |
| 7 people       | $3785/month                   |
| Each additional person | +$429/month           |

**Asset/Resource Limits:**
Countable resources include funds in bank accounts but exclude a primary residence. Alabama does not have an asset limit for most households. However, if a household with a member who is 60 or older or has a disability does not meet the gross income test, an asset limit of $4250 applies.

**Deductions:**

| Deduction Type                 | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **Child Support Payments**     | Court-ordered child support can be deducted from net income. |
| **Medical Deduction**          | Out-of-pocket medical expenses for members 60 or older or with disabilities can be deducted, either the full amount (minus $35) with verification or a standard deduction of $175 without full documentation if expenses exceed $35. |
| **Utility Allowances**         | Only one utility allowance is applicable per household. |
| **Heating and Cooling**        | $601 |
| **Basic Utility Allowance**    | $434 |
| **Phone**                      | $52 |
| **Other Deductions**           | 20% of earned income, Dependent care costs for work or education, Monthly rent or mortgage payments, Homeowner's insurance and taxes |

**Maximum Benefit Amounts:**
SNAP benefits are based on a household's net income, with specific amounts allotted based on household size.

| Household Size | Maximum Benefit Amount |
|----------------|------------------------|
| 1 person       | $291/month             |
| 2 people       | $535/month             |
| 3 people       | $766/month             |
| 4 people       | $973/month             |
| 5 people       | $1155/month            |
| 6 people       | $1386/month            |
