### SNAP Eligibility in North Carolina

There are three eligibility tests for SNAP: the Gross Income, the Net Income, and the Asset tests. Depending on your state and whether your household has a member who is 60 or older or has a disability, your household may be exempt from the Gross Income, Net Income, and/or Asset tests.

North Carolina has expanded eligibility beyond the standard federal SNAP eligibility requirements, which is why other websites may display stricter financial eligibility requirements than what you see on this page.

While the Gross Income and Asset tests are straightforward, Net Income is more difficult to calculate. We recommend using our SNAP Eligibility Calculator to see if you're income eligible for SNAP benefits.

This information was collected from USDA and state SNAP resources but is not official. This website is not affiliated with any government organization or SNAP/WIC program.

### Gross Income Limits
Total monthly household income before taxes, including job, self-employment, and other income like social security, disability, child support, worker's comp, unemployment, and pension income.

| Household Size | Monthly Gross Income Limit |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| 1 person       | $2430 / month               |
| 2 people       | $3288 / month               |
| 3 people       | $4144 / month               |
| 4 people       | $5000 / month               |
| 5 people       | $5858 / month               |
| 6 people       | $6714 / month               |
| 7 people       | $7570 / month               |
| Each additional person | +$858 / month       |

The gross income limit is 200% of the federal poverty level.

### Net Income Limits
Net income is a household's gross income minus deductions.

| Household Size | Monthly Net Income Limit |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| 1 person       | $1215 / month             |
| 2 people       | $1644 / month             |
| 3 people       | $2072 / month             |
| 4 people       | $2500 / month             |
| 5 people       | $2929 / month             |
| 6 people       | $3357 / month             |
| 7 people       | $3785 / month             |
| Each additional person | +$429 / month     |

The net income limit is 100% of the federal poverty level.

### Asset / Resource Limit
This means countable resources, like funds in bank accounts. A home is not counted as a resource.

There is no asset limit in North Carolina. If the household has a member who is 60 or older or has a disability and did not meet the Gross Income test above, there is an asset limit of $4250.

Note: The SNAP application may still ask about your household's assets, even if the asset limit does not apply.

### Deductions
#### Child Support Payments Treatment
Court-ordered child support payments can be deducted when calculating net income.

#### Standard Medical Deduction
Monthly out-of-pocket medical expenses for household members who are 60 or older or have a disability can be deducted when calculating net income. You can deduct the full amount of expenses (minus $35) with verification.

#### Utility Allowances
Households can only receive one utility allowance. If a household qualifies for multiple allowances, choose the highest allowance.

| Household Size | Heating and Cooling | Basic Limited Allowance | Phone |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| 1 person       | $585                 | $371                    | $41   |
| 2 people       | $643                 | $408                    | $41   |
| 3 people       | $707                 | $448                    | $41   |
| 4 people       | $770                 | $488                    | $41   |
| 5+ people      | $839                 | $532                    | $41   |

### Other Deductions
Households can receive deductions for the following expenses. Shelter deductions (utilities, rent, and homeowners insurance) only apply for the amount that total shelter expenses exceed a percentage of household income, and are limited to a maximum amount if the household does not contain a member who is 60 or older or has a disability.

- A 20% deduction from job or self-employment income (earned income)
- Dependent care costs (including daycare, babysitters, or other child care) needed for work or school
- Monthly rent or mortgage amount
- Monthly homeowners insurance and taxes

### Maximum Benefit Amounts
SNAP benefit amounts are based on a household's net income. Our SNAP Eligibility Calculator can give you a dollar estimate of what you could receive in SNAP benefits.

| Household Size | Maximum Benefit Amount |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| 1 person       | $291 / month            |
| 2 people       | $535 / month            |
