### SNAP Eligibility in New York

There are three eligibility tests for SNAP: the Gross Income, the Net Income, and the Asset tests. Depending on your state and whether your household has a member who is 60 or older or has a disability, your household may be exempt from the Gross Income, Net Income, and/or Asset tests.

New York has expanded eligibility beyond the standard federal SNAP eligibility requirements, which is why other websites may display stricter financial eligibility requirements than what you see on this page.

While the Gross Income and Asset tests are straightforward, Net Income is more difficult to calculate. We recommend using our SNAP Eligibility Calculator to see if you're income eligible for SNAP benefits.

Note: The SNAP application may still ask about your household's assets, even if the asset limit does not apply.

### Deductions
#### Child Support Payments Treatment
Court-ordered child support payments are excluded from gross income. Unlike other deductions that only impact net income, child support payments are excluded from gross income, reducing both gross and net income.

#### Standard Medical Deduction
Monthly out-of-pocket medical expenses for household members who are 60 or older or have a disability can be deducted when calculating net income. You can deduct the full amount of expenses (minus $35) with verification.

#### Utility Allowances
Households can only receive one utility allowance. If a household qualifies for multiple allowances, choose the highest allowance.
