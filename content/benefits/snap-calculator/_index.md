### SNAP Eligibility and Application Guide

#### Am I Eligible for SNAP?
To be eligible for SNAP benefits, your household must meet certain criteria. If your state agency determines that you qualify, you will receive benefits back to the date you submitted your application.

#### How Do I Apply for SNAP?
You must apply for SNAP in the state where you currently live. Each state has a different application form and process, so a household member must contact your state agency directly to apply.

#### How to Get State Information
If you cannot visit or call your local SNAP office or lack internet access, you may designate another person as an authorized representative to apply and be interviewed on your behalf. This designation must be in writing.

#### What Happens When I Apply for SNAP?
After submitting your application, your state agency will process it and notify you of your eligibility within 30 days. During this period, you must complete an eligibility interview and provide proof of the information you submitted. The interview can be conducted over the phone or in person. If eligible, benefits are provided from the date of application.

You might receive benefits within 7 days if you meet additional criteria, such as having less than $100 in liquid resources and $150 in monthly gross income, or if your householdâ€™s combined monthly gross income and liquid resources are less than your monthly rent or mortgage and utility expenses.

#### How Do I Receive SNAP Benefits?
If eligible, you will receive benefits on an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card, which works like a debit card. Benefits are automatically loaded into your account each month and can be used to buy groceries at authorized stores.

#### How Long Will I Receive SNAP?
Your certification period, which indicates how long you will receive benefits, will be specified in a notice. Before this period ends, you will receive a notice to recertify to continue receiving benefits.

#### Who Is in a SNAP Household?
A SNAP household includes everyone who lives together and purchases and prepares meals together. Certain individuals, like spouses and most children under 22, are included in the same household even if they prepare meals separately. People aged 60 or older with a disability may be a separate household if their income is below a certain level.

#### What Resources Can I Have and Still Get SNAP Benefits?
Households may have $2,750 in countable resources, or $4,250 if a member is 60 or older or disabled. Resources like a home and lot, resources of people receiving SSI or TANF, and most retirement plans are not counted.

#### Do Vehicles Count as Resources?
Vehicles count as a resource for SNAP purposes, but states determine how they count. Licensed vehicles are not counted if used for income-producing purposes, long-distance travel for work, as a home, or for transporting a disabled household member. Non-excluded licensed vehicles count the fair market value over $4,650 as a resource.

#### What Are the SNAP Income Limits?
Households typically must meet both gross and net income limits. Gross income is the total non-excluded income before deductions, while net income is gross income minus allowable deductions.

**SNAP Income Eligibility Limits (Oct. 1, 2023 - Sept. 30, 2024):**

| Household Size | Gross Monthly Income (130% FPL) | Net Monthly Income (100% FPL) |

| 4              | $3,250                           | $2,500                        |

| 6              | $4,364                           | $3,357                        |
| 7              | $4,921                           | $3,785                        |
| 8              | $5,478                           | $4,214                        |
| Each additional member | +$557                   | +$429                         |

#### What Deductions Are Allowed in SNAP?
- 20% deduction from earned income.
- Standard deduction of $198 for households of 1 to 3 people (higher for larger households).
- Dependent care deduction for work, training, or education.
- Medical expenses over $35 for elderly or disabled members not covered by insurance.
- Legally owed child support payments in some states.
- Standard shelter deduction for homeless households of $179.66.
- Excess shelter costs deduction.

#### How Much Could I Receive in SNAP Benefits?
Your SNAP benefits, or allotment, are based on your household's net monthly income and are calculated by multiplying your net income by 0.3 and subtracting the result from the maximum monthly allotment for your household size.

**SNAP Maximum Monthly Allotment Based on Household Size:**

| People in Household | Maximum Monthly Allotment |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| 1                   | $291                       |
| 2                   | $535                       |
| 3                   | $766                       |
| 4                   | $973                       |
| 5                   | $1,155                     |
| 6                   | $1,386                     |
| 7                   | $1,532                     |
| 8                   | $1,751                     |
| Each additional person | +$219                  |

#### What Are the SNAP Work Requirements?
Most people must meet work requirements, including registering for work, not quitting a job, taking job offers, and participating in employment and training programs. Some groups, such as children, seniors, and individuals with disabilities, are exempt.

#### Are Students Eligible for SNAP?
Students aged 18-49 enrolled at least half-time in college are generally not eligible for SNAP unless they meet specific exemptions.

#### Are Non-Citizens Eligible for SNAP?
Non-citizens must meet certain criteria, such as having lived in the U.S. for at least five years, receiving disability-related assistance, or being children under 18. They must also meet other SNAP eligibility requirements.

#### What If I Disagree with a Decision on My SNAP Case?
If you disagree with a decision, you can request a fair hearing within 90 days of the decision. You can request a hearing over the phone, in writing, or in person at the local SNAP office.

#### Nondiscrimination in SNAP
The USDA prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, parental status, income from public assistance programs, political beliefs, or reprisal for prior civil rights activity. Program information may be available in alternative formats and languages.
