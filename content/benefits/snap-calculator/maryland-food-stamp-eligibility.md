### SNAP Eligibility in Maryland

In Maryland, SNAP eligibility is determined through three main tests: Gross Income, Net Income, and Asset tests. Depending on household circumstances, such as having a member who is 60 or older or has a disability, exemptions from certain tests may apply.

Maryland has expanded its SNAP eligibility criteria beyond federal requirements, so other sources might show stricter financial requirements than those listed here. For a precise assessment, we recommend using the SNAP Eligibility Calculator.

#### Gross Income Limits
Total monthly household income before taxes, including job, self-employment, and other income like social security, disability, child support, worker's comp, unemployment, and pension income.

| Household Size | Gross Monthly Income Limit (200% of FPL) |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $2,430                                    |
| 2 people       | $3,288                                    |
| 3 people       | $4,144                                    |
| 4 people       | $5,000                                    |
| 5 people       | $5,858                                    |
| 6 people       | $6,714                                    |
| 7 people       | $7,570                                    |
| Each additional person | +$858                             |

If the household has a member who is 60 or older or has a disability and exceeds the gross income limit, it can qualify by meeting the Net Income and Asset tests.

#### Net Income Limits
Net income is gross income minus deductions. Calculating net income can be complex, especially for shelter-related expenses (utilities and rent) that exceed half the household's income after other deductions. There is also a cap on the maximum shelter deduction for some households.

| Household Size | Net Monthly Income Limit (100% of FPL) |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $1,215                                  |
| 2 people       | $1,644                                  |
| 3 people       | $2,072                                  |
| 4 people       | $2,500                                  |
| 5 people       | $2,929                                  |
| 6 people       | $3,357                                  |
| 7 people       | $3,785                                  |
| Each additional person | +$429                           |

Households with a member who is 60 or older or has a disability only need to meet the Net Income test if they did not pass the Gross Income test above.

#### Asset/Resource Limit
Countable resources include funds in bank accounts, excluding a home.

There is no asset limit in Maryland. However, if the household has a member who is 60 or older or has a disability and did not meet the Gross Income test, there is an asset limit of $4,250.

#### Deductions

**Child Support Payments Treatment**
- Court-ordered child support payments can be deducted when calculating net income.

**Standard Medical Deduction**
- Monthly out-of-pocket medical expenses for household members who are 60 or older or have a disability can be deducted. You can deduct the full amount of expenses (minus $35) with verification.

**Utility Allowances**
- Households can only receive one utility allowance. If a household qualifies for multiple allowances, choose the highest allowance.
  - Heating and Cooling: $551
  - Basic Utility Allowance: $337
  - Single Utilities (Phone): $40

**Other Deductions**
- A 20% deduction from job or self-employment income (earned income).
- Dependent care costs (including daycare, babysitters, or other child care) needed for work or school.
- Monthly rent or mortgage amount.
- Monthly homeowners insurance and taxes.

#### Maximum Benefit Amounts
SNAP benefits are based on a household's net income. Use our SNAP Eligibility Calculator to get an estimate of what you could receive.

| Household Size | Maximum Monthly Benefit Amount |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $291                            |
| 2 people       | $535                            |
| 3 people       | $766                            |
| 4 people       | $973                            |
| 5 people       | $1,155                          |
| 6 people       | $1,386                          |
| 7 people       | $1,532                          |
