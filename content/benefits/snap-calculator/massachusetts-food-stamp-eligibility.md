### SNAP Eligibility in Massachusetts

In Massachusetts, SNAP eligibility is determined by three main tests: the Gross Income, Net Income, and Asset tests. Depending on the state and household circumstances (such as having a member who is 60 or older or has a disability), households may be exempt from some of these tests.

Massachusetts has expanded eligibility beyond the federal requirements, which may result in different financial criteria than other sources. We recommend using our SNAP Eligibility Calculator to check if you qualify for benefits.

#### Gross Income Limits
Total monthly household income before taxes, including job, self-employment, and other income such as social security, disability, child support, worker's comp, unemployment, and pension income.

| Household Size | Gross Monthly Income Limit (200% of FPL) |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $2,430                                    |
| 2 people       | $3,288                                    |
| 3 people       | $4,144                                    |
| 4 people       | $5,000                                    |
| 5 people       | $5,858                                    |
| 6 people       | $6,714                                    |
| 7 people       | $7,570                                    |
| Each additional person | +$858                             |

If the household has a member who is 60 or older or has a disability and exceeds the gross income limit, it can qualify by meeting the Net Income and Asset tests.

#### Net Income Limits
Net income is gross income minus deductions. Calculating net income can be complex, especially for shelter-related expenses (utilities and rent) that exceed half the household's income after other deductions. There is also a cap on the maximum shelter deduction for some households.

| Household Size | Net Monthly Income Limit (100% of FPL) |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $1,215                                  |
| 2 people       | $1,644                                  |
| 3 people       | $2,072                                  |
| 4 people       | $2,500                                  |
| 5 people       | $2,929                                  |
| 6 people       | $3,357                                  |
| 7 people       | $3,785                                  |
| Each additional person | +$429                           |

Households with a member who is 60 or older or has a disability only need to meet the Net Income test if they did not pass the Gross Income test above.

#### Asset/Resource Limit
Countable resources include funds in bank accounts, excluding a home.

There is no asset limit in Massachusetts. However, if the household has a member who is 60 or older or has a disability and did not meet the Gross Income test, there is an asset limit of $4,250.

#### Deductions

**Child Support Payments Treatment**
- Court-ordered child support payments can be deducted when calculating net income.

**Standard Medical Deduction**
- Monthly out-of-pocket medical expenses for household members who are 60 or older or have a disability can be deducted. You can deduct the full amount of expenses (minus $35) with verification. Alternatively, if you have medical expenses over $35, you can use the standard medical deduction amount of $155 without needing to verify all expenses.

**Utility Allowances**
- Households can only receive one utility allowance. If a household qualifies for multiple allowances, choose the highest allowance.
  - Heating and Cooling: $852
  - Basic Utility Allowance: $520
  - Single Utilities (Phone): $59

**Other Deductions**
- A 20% deduction from job or self-employment income (earned income).
- Dependent care costs (including daycare, babysitters, or other child care) needed for work or school.
- Monthly rent or mortgage amount.
- Monthly homeowners insurance and taxes.

#### Maximum Benefit Amounts
SNAP benefits are based on a household's net income. Use our SNAP Eligibility Calculator to get an estimate of what you could receive.

| Household Size | Maximum Monthly Benefit Amount |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $291                            |
