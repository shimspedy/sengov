### SNAP Eligibility in Maine

In Maine, eligibility for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) is determined by three tests: Gross Income, Net Income, and Asset tests. These tests help determine whether a household qualifies for SNAP benefits. Maine has expanded eligibility beyond the standard federal requirements, so you may find stricter financial criteria on other websites. We recommend using the SNAP Eligibility Calculator for a precise assessment.

#### Gross Income Limits
Gross income includes total monthly household income before taxes, such as job earnings, self-employment income, social security, disability benefits, child support, worker's compensation, unemployment benefits, and pension income.

**All Households**
If a household has a member who is 60 or older or has a disability but exceeds the gross income limit, it can qualify by meeting the Net Income and Asset tests.

| Household Size | Gross Monthly Income Limit (200% of FPL) |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $2,430                                    |
| 2 people       | $3,288                                    |
| 3 people       | $4,144                                    |
| 4 people       | $5,000                                    |
| 5 people       | $5,858                                    |
| 6 people       | $6,714                                    |
| 7 people       | $7,570                                    |
| Each additional person | +$858                             |

#### Net Income Limits
Net income is calculated by subtracting allowable deductions from gross income. Calculating net income can be challenging, especially for shelter-related expenses, which can only be deducted if they exceed half the household's income after other deductions. Additionally, there is a cap on the maximum shelter deduction for some households.

| Household Size | Net Monthly Income Limit (100% of FPL) |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $1,215                                  |
| 2 people       | $1,644                                  |
| 3 people       | $2,072                                  |
| 4 people       | $2,500                                  |
| 5 people       | $2,929                                  |
| 6 people       | $3,357                                  |
| 7 people       | $3,785                                  |
| Each additional person | +$429                           |

Households with a member who is 60 or older or has a disability need to meet this test only if they did not pass the Gross Income test above.

#### Asset/Resource Limit
Countable resources include funds in bank accounts. A home is not counted as a resource.

There is no asset limit in Maine. However, if the household has a member who is 60 or older or has a disability and did not meet the Gross Income test, there is an asset limit of $4,250.

**Note:** The SNAP application may still ask about your household's assets, even if the asset limit does not apply.

#### Deductions

**Child Support Payments Treatment**
Court-ordered child support payments are excluded from gross income, reducing both gross and net income.

**Standard Medical Deduction**
Monthly out-of-pocket medical expenses for household members who are 60 or older or have a disability can be deducted when calculating net income. You can deduct the full amount of expenses (minus $35) with verification.

**Utility Allowances**
Households can receive only one utility allowance. If a household qualifies for multiple allowances, choose the highest allowance.

- Heating and Cooling: $1,011
- Basic Utility Allowance: $341
- Single Utilities (Phone): $58

**Other Deductions**
Households can receive deductions for the following expenses. Shelter deductions (utilities, rent, and homeowners insurance) apply only for the amount that total shelter expenses exceed a percentage of household income and are limited to a maximum amount if the household does not contain a member who is 60 or older or has a disability.

- A 20% deduction from job or self-employment income (earned income)
- Dependent care costs (including daycare, babysitters, or other child care) needed for work or school
- Monthly rent or mortgage amount
- Monthly homeowners insurance and taxes

#### Maximum Benefit Amounts
SNAP benefits are based on a household's net income. Use the SNAP Eligibility Calculator to get an estimate of what you could receive.

| Household Size | Maximum Monthly Benefit Amount |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $291                            |
| 2 people       | $535                            |
| 3 people       | $766                            |
| 4 people       | $973                            |
| 5 people       | $1,155                          |
| 6 people       | $1,386                          |
| 7 people       | $1,532                          |
| Each additional person | +$429                   |
