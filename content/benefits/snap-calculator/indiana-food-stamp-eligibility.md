### SNAP Eligibility in Indiana

To qualify for SNAP benefits in Indiana, households must meet three eligibility tests: the Gross Income, Net Income, and Asset tests. Depending on whether a household member is 60 or older or has a disability, your household may be exempt from one or more of these tests.

Indiana has expanded eligibility beyond the standard federal SNAP requirements, so you might see different financial eligibility requirements on other websites.

While the Gross Income and Asset tests are straightforward, Net Income is more complex to calculate. We recommend using our SNAP Eligibility Calculator to determine if you qualify for SNAP benefits.

#### Gross Income Limits
Total monthly household income before taxes includes job income, self-employment income, and other income such as social security, disability, child support, worker's compensation, unemployment, and pension income.

| Household Size | Gross Monthly Income Limit (130% of FPL) |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $1,579                                    |
| 2 people       | $2,137                                    |
| 3 people       | $2,693                                    |
| 4 people       | $3,250                                    |

#### Expanded Income Limits for Households with Members 60 or Older or with a Disability
There is no gross income limit in Indiana for households with a household member who is 60 or older or has a disability.

#### Net Income Limits
Net income is a household's gross income minus deductions. Calculating net income can be complex, as shelter-related expenses (utilities and rent) can only be deducted if they exceed half the household's income after other deductions. Additionally, there is a limit on the maximum shelter deduction for some households.

| Household Size | Net Monthly Income Limit (100% of FPL) |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 person       | $1,215                                  |
| 2 people       | $1,644                                  |
| 3 people       | $2,072                                  |
| 4 people       | $2,500                                  |
| 5 people       | $2,929                                  |
| 6 people       | $3,357                                  |
| 7 people       | $3,785                                  |
| Each additional person | +$429                          |

#### Asset/Resource Limit
Countable resources include funds in bank accounts but exclude a home.

| Households | Asset Limit |
|------------|-------------|
| All Households | $5,000  |

#### Deductions

**Child Support Payments**
- Court-ordered child support payments can be deducted when calculating net income.

**Other Deductions**
