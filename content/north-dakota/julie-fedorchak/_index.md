Congresswoman Julie Fedorchak is a fourth-generation North Dakotan, proudly representing her state’s people, values, and traditions in Washington, D.C. 

Julie has 30 years of experience in business and public service. Most recently, she completed 12 years as a member of the North Dakota Public Service Commission. In that role, she helped deliver North Dakota families and businesses the lowest utilities services costs in the nation, permitted more than $15 billion in energy infrastructure projects, and advocated for reliability-based market reforms as her state’s liaison to the 15-state grid operator MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator). 

Julie rose to several national and regional leadership positions in the energy sector, including president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), a post she completed in November 2024. Julie has been a national advocate for the responsible, aggressive energy development that is necessary for economic growth, public safety and national security.

Prior to being a utility regulator, Julie was U.S. Senator John Hoeven’s state director for two years. Early in her career she served as communications director for North Dakota Governor Ed Schafer, helping to strengthen the state’s business climate and drive economic growth. She later founded a successful communications business which she ran for 10 years, authoring several books and articles, and working with clients across business, government, and politics.

Born in Williston, raised in Fargo, and a graduate of Bismarck Century High School and the University of North Dakota, Julie embodies North Dakota’s hardworking and resilient spirit. Growing up as the youngest of eight children, she spent summers on her family farm near Belden, where she developed a deep appreciation for North Dakota’s farming and ranching communities. 

Julie and her husband, Mike, a Navy veteran, have been married for 25 years, live in Mandan and have three grown children. They are active members of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit parish and are involved in various community organizations, including the University of Mary, where Julie serves on the Board of Trustees.

In her free time, Julie enjoys entertaining, golfing, hunting, traveling, and cheering on North Dakota’s sports teams. Above all, she remains passionate about serving the people of North Dakota and preserving the state’s values for future generations.
