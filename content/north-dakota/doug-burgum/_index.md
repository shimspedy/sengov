     description: Governor Doug Burgum took office as the 33rd governor of North Dakota on December 15, 2016. Prior to being elected Governor, Gov. Burgum led Great Plains as CEO through its initial public offering in 1997 and acquisition by Microsoft Corp. in 2001. In 2006, Gov. Burgum reaffirmed his passion for North Dakota by founding Kilbourne Group, a real estate development firm committed to creating smart, healthy cities through vibrant downtowns. In 2008, he co-founded Arthur Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in ambitious, mission-driven software companies. In 2009, then-Gov. John Hoeven awarded Gov. Burgum the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award, North Dakota’s highest citizen honor. The award recognized Burgum for his business leadership and numerous philanthropic efforts, including the Doug Burgum Family Fund, which focuses its charitable giving on youth and education. Born August 1, 1956, Gov. Burgum grew up in Arthur, N.D. He has maintained his commitment and connection to his roots through family farm partnerships, by serving as a member for Arthur Companies, Inc., a diversified agribusiness company founded by his grandparents in 1906, and through a ranching partnership in the Badlands of western North Dakota. Gov. Burgum graduated with a bachelor’s degree in university studies from North Dakota State University in 1978. He earned a master’s of business administration from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business in 1980. Gov. Burgum is married to Kathryn Burgum and has two sons, Joe and Tom, and a daughter, Jesse.
