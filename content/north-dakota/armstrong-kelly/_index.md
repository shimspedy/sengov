Kelly Armstrong took office as the 34th governor of North Dakota on Dec. 15, 2024 and brings a background in business, a love for the outdoors and a passion for volunteering and public service to the Governor's Office.

Kelly is a lifelong, devoted North Dakotan and a tireless advocate for making North Dakota a better place to live, work, and raise a family. 

Kelly was elected to the U.S. House of Representative in 2018, representing North Dakota's at-large congressional district. During his tenure, Armstrong was an advocate for energy independence, agricultural interests and conservative fiscal policies, reflecting the priorities of his largely rural and resource-rich home state.

A staunch supporter of North Dakota's oil and gas industries, Armstrong worked to advance legislation aimed at reducing regulatory burdens and promoting domestic energy production. He has also championed policies to support farmers and ranchers, advocating for fair trade agreements and federal assistance during economic challenges.

In Congress, Armstrong was an active member of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 

Prior to his congressional career, Kelly served in the North Dakota Senate from 2012 to 2019 representing District 36. He spearheaded legislation to reform DUI laws and pass a $2 billion statewide investment into our infrastructure. Kelly was elected Chairman of the North Dakota Republican Party in 2015 and led the party to landslide victories for President Donald Trump, Gov. Doug Burgum, and ND Legislative Majorities. His legal background as an attorney has influenced his legislative priorities and contributions to legal and regulatory debates.

Kelly grew up in Dickinson, he earned his bachelorâ€™s degree from the University of North Dakota and received his law degree in 2003 from UND as well. 

Kelly married his wife Kjersti in 2004 and they have two children, Anna and Eli.
