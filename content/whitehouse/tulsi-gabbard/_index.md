Lieutenant Colonel Tulsi Gabbard’s life is defined by her unwavering commitment to service and her love of country. From her earliest days in public office to her extensive military career, she has dedicated her life in service to protect the safety, security and freedom of the American people and our nation.

The people of Hawaii elected LTC Tulsi Gabbard to the State Legislature when she was 21 years old, to the Honolulu City Council eight years later, and at age 31, to the United States Congress where she served  for four terms. Having experienced firsthand the true cost of war, LTC Gabbard vowed to honor the lives and sacrifice of her brothers and sisters in uniform, serving on the Armed Services, Homeland Security, and Foreign Affairs Committees in Congress.

A combat veteran with three deployments to the Middle East and Africa as part of a special operations mission to counter terrorism, LTC Gabbard has served in uniform since 2003. She served in a medical unit  during her 2005 deployment to Iraq and later led a Military Police platoon in Kuwait, where she was the first woman to receive an award of appreciation from the Kuwaiti military, earning their hard-won respect. She currently serves in the U.S. Army Reserve as Battalion Commander of the 1-354 Regiment in Tulsa, Oklahoma, leading soldiers in Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas.

LTC Tulsi Gabbard approaches every issue, domestic and foreign, with a focus on ensuring the safety, security, and freedom of the American people. She is honored to be President Trump’s nominee for Director of National Intelligence and is committed to securing the nation, upholding  the Constitution and serving the American people.
