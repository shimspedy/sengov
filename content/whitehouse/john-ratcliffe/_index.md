Pam Bondi is a fourth-generation Floridian from Tampa, Florida who spent more than 18 years as a prosecutor, trying cases ranging from domestic violence to capital murder. In 2010, she ran for Florida Attorney General, becoming the 37th and first female Attorney General in Florida’s history, serving for two consecutive terms from 2011-2019.

As Florida’s Attorney General, Pam Bondi remained unwavering in her commitment to make Florida the safest state to live, work, and raise a family. When Attorney General Bondi took office, Florida was referred to as the pill mill capital of the United States. Of the top 100 oxycodone dispensers in the country, 98 of them were in Florida. In her first legislative session, Attorney General Bondi successfully fought for tough legislation to shut down all 98 of these unscrupulous doctors and clinics. She was then appointed Co-chair of the Substance Abuse Committee for the National Association of Attorneys General and to President Trump’s Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission where she worked alongside other national leaders in areas of prevention, interdiction, and treatment.

In her commitment to combating human trafficking, Attorney General Bondi spearheaded efforts to strengthen Florida’s state laws, raise public awareness, and provide enhanced resources for victims. Under her leadership, the Florida Legislature created the Florida Statewide Human Trafficking Council. Attorney General Bondi served as Chair of the Council until the conclusion of her tenure as Florida Attorney General.

In 2019, Attorney General Bondi joined the White House as Special Advisor to President Trump in the Office of White House Counsel, working on the defense legal team throughout the unprecedented Impeachment Proceedings.

Attorney General Bondi also served on the Board of Trustees for the Kennedy Center and as the Chair of the Center for Litigation, Co-Chair of the Center for Law and Justice, and Chair of the Florida Chapter at the America First Policy Institute.
