Marco Rubio is the son of two hardworking immigrants from Cuba. His father worked as a banquet bartender, and his mother balanced caring for the family at home while working in a factory, as a cashier, and as hotel maid. Rubio saw firsthand how hard work, faith, and community helped his parents achieve the American Dream.

Born in Miami, Rubio was drawn to public service in large part because of his grandfather, who saw his homeland destroyed by communism. During his 14 years in the U.S. Senate, Rubio fought to protect the freedoms and opportunities that made America the greatest country in the history of the world. Rubio also traveled to dozens of countries, met with countless foreign leaders, and saw firsthand how America’s enemies are weakening our nation. As America’s 72nd U.S. Secretary of State, Rubio will ensure U.S. foreign policy makes America stronger, safer, and more prosperous.

Rubio met his wife Jeanette, who was also born and raised in Miami, through mutual friends. They were married in 1998. Together, they’ve raised four children: Amanda, Daniella, Anthony, and Dominick.
