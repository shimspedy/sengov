Kelly Loeffler is an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and former U.S. Senator from Georgia who dedicates her life to growing businesses and advancing economic opportunity for all.

A self-made businesswoman, Kelly rose from modest beginnings, working on her family’s farm and small trucking business, to build a three-decade career in financial services and technology. As a member of the executive leadership team at Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), she helped build ICE from a small startup to a Fortune 500 company. In 2018, she launched Bakkt (NYSE:BKKT), a fintech startup in digital assets, as its founding CEO.

Kelly served in the U.S. Senate in 2020, where she brought her private-sector experience to Washington. She served on key committees including Agriculture, Joint Economic, HELP, and Veterans Affairs – championing conservative values, pro-growth policies, advocating for small businesses, and passing legislation to strengthen economic resilience.

As co-owner of the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream for a decade, Senator Loeffler helped position the franchise as a platform to empower women through sports, demonstrating her commitment to community impact.

After her Senate service, Kelly founded Greater Georgia Action, an election integrity advocacy and voter registration non-profit, as well as RallyRight, a conservative tech startup – while serving on several corporate and philanthropic boards.

She earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Illinois, an MBA from DePaul University, and is the only CFA® charterholder to ever serve in Congress. A devout Catholic, she is a staunch advocate for free enterprise and opportunity for all Americans through the America First agenda.
