Sean Duffy served as Congressman from Wisconsin’s 7th District in the US Congress for ten years, serving on the House Financial Services Committee and actively leading on local transportation issues via his co-chairmanship of the Great Lakes Task Force. 

Prior to serving in Congress, Duffy was the District Attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin, for ten years. There he brought over a hundred cases to trial with an over 90% trial success rate. After leaving Congress, Duffy hosted the Fox Business show, “The Bottom Line with Dagen and Duffy.”   

Sean was born and raised in Hayward, Wisconsin. As the tenth of eleven siblings in a large Irish Catholic family, Sean learned the enduring value of cooperation and compromise. Duffy also comes from a long line of lumberjacks, who helped build his beloved state of Wisconsin, and was a world-champion lumberjack athlete. He holds a marketing degree from St. Mary’s University, and a J.D. degree from William Mitchell College of Law.

When Sean was in his twenties, he got his start in television on the MTV reality TV show, “The Real World”. He also starred on “Road Rules All Stars,” where he met his wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy. 

Rachel and Sean are America’s first and longest-married reality TV couple. They have been married for 25 years and have nine children together.
