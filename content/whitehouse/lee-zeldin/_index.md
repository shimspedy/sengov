Lee Zeldin is a former United States Congressman who represented New York’s First Congressional District from 2015 to 2023. In 2022, Zeldin made national headlines by nearly winning New York’s gubernatorial race, garnering the most votes for a Republican candidate statewide since Nelson Rockefeller over 50 years earlier. His strong performance at the top of the ticket helped Republicans flip multiple suburban House districts in New York, resulting in the Republican Party’s majority in the House of Representatives. 

Born and raised in Suffolk County, New York, at just 23, Lee Zeldin became the youngest attorney in New York at the time. Zeldin served four years on active duty in the U.S. Army, where he held roles as a Military Intelligence Officer, Prosecutor, and Military Magistrate. In the summer of 2006, Lee Zeldin deployed to Iraq with an infantry battalion of fellow paratroopers from the Army’s elite 82nd Airborne Division in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 

Today, he continues his service as a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, marking over two decades in the military. In 2010, Zeldin was elected to the New York State Senate, where he served until 2014, when he won a seat in Congress. During his eight years in Congress, Zeldin served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Financial Services Committee. As one of two Jewish Republicans in Congress, he co-chaired the House Republican Israel Caucus, which had over 100 members. He was a vocal advocate on foreign policy, border security, military affairs, combating antisemitism, environmental issues, energy policy, and much more. 

For his district, he championed vast infrastructure and research projects, including the preservation of Plum Island, Army Corps of Engineers initiatives, and a $2 billion Electron-Ion Collider for Brookhaven National Lab.

Lee Zeldin currently resides on Long Island, in New York State, with his wife, Diana. Their twin daughters, Mikayla and Arianna, recently left for college, marking an exciting new chapter for their family.
