Known as a leading trade expert, Jamieson served in the Trump administration as Chief of Staff to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Ambassador Robert Lighthizer. During his time, he worked very closely Ambassador Lighthizer and senior White House officials in executing historic trade agreements — such as the Phase One trade deal with China and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. 

Jamieson participated in every major Administration trade action initiated during his time at USTR. These actions played a significant role in reshoring American businesses and leveling the playing field for American workers, farmers, manufacturers, and consumers.

Jamieson also served in the U.S. Air Force Judge Advocate General’s Corps, with a deployment to Iraq.
