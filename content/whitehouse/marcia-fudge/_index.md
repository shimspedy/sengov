Marcia Louise Fudge (born October 29, 1952) is an American attorney and politician serving as the 18th United States secretary of housing and urban development since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, she served as the U.S. representative for Ohio's 11th congressional district from 2008 to 2021. The district includes most of the black-majority precincts between Cleveland and Akron. Following the death of Stephanie Tubbs Jones in 2008, Fudge ran unopposed in the special election to replace her. She was chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 113th Congress. 

She considered running for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives at the start of the 116th Congress but eventually announced she would back Nancy Pelosi. 

Then president-elect Joe Biden nominated Fudge as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development on December 10, 2020. The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs advanced her nomination by a vote of 177 on February 4, 2021. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021, by a vote of 6634. She was virtually sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on March 10, 2021. Upon taking her oath of office, she became the second African-American woman to serve as secretary of housing and urban development.
