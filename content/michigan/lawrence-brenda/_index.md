A lifelong resident of Michigan, her district included parts of Detroit, Southfield, and 16 other cities in Oakland and Wayne counties.

In 2014, she was elected to Congress, where she served four terms, rising to leadership as Freshman Whip and later Senior Whip. She was a Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s Subcommittee on the Interior and served on the House Committee on Small Business. Her priorities included infrastructure, education, women’s rights, and economic development.
