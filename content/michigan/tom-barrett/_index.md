Representative Tom Barrett represents Michigan’s 7th Congressional District. A lifelong Michigan resident, Tom grew up in a hardworking family where his father worked two jobs and his mother stayed home to raise Tom and his six siblings. From an early age, he learned the importance of hard work, perseverance, and the value of family.

After high school, Tom joined the United States Army, where he served for 22 years in multiple key locations around the world, including Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, Kuwait, and the Korean DMZ. Throughout his military career, he logged over 1,000 hours flying advanced helicopters, earning numerous awards and distinctions along the way.

After retiring from the military, Tom returned to Michigan, where he was shocked to discover that veterans were facing significant challenges finding employment. With Michigan holding one of the highest veteran unemployment rates in the nation, Tom knew he had to take action. He ran for the Michigan State Legislature, where he became a strong advocate for veterans, working to improve resources and opportunities for those who served.

Tom is a graduate of Western Michigan University, where he earned his degree with honors in 2007 through the Montgomery GI Bill. He lives in Charlotte, Michigan, with his wife, Ashley, and their four children: Patrick, Eleanora, Gwendolyn, and Louis.

Representative Barrett is committed to restoring America’s values of hard work, freedom, and opportunity for all. He is dedicated to ensuring that Michigan’s 7th District and the nation remain places where everyone can thrive.

Michigan’s 7th Congressional District includes all of Ingham, Clinton, Shiawassee, and Livingston Counties, most of Eaton County, and parts of Oakland and Genesee Counties.
