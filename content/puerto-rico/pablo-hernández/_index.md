Pablo José Hernández, born on May 11, 1991, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is the youngest Resident Commissioner in Puerto Rico’s history. Elected with the highest number of votes of any official in the 2024 election, he represents the people of Puerto Rico in the U.S. Congress with a focus on economic development, equity in federal programs, and infrastructure rebuilding.  

Hernández began his political career in 2008 as a volunteer for the mayoral race in San Juan before he was old enough to vote. His innovative use of social media in his uncle’s successful campaign for the Puerto Rico Senate that same year highlighted his early understanding of digital tools in modern politics. By 2012, he was serving as absentee voting coordinator for Puerto Rico’s Popular Democratic Party.  

After earning a Bachelor’s degree, Hernández worked in the Puerto Rico Governor’s Office, focusing on policy and administrative priorities, before departing to pursue a law degree at Stanford Law School. There, he worked with the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic and explored the intersection of social media and democracy.  

Following his graduation, Hernández clerked for Judge Gustavo Gelpí in Puerto Rico’s Federal District Court. He later worked in Washington, D.C., gaining experience in both legal practice at a prominent law firm and in public policy at a leading tech company.  

In addition to his public service, Hernández is an accomplished author. His works include Compatriotas: Exilio y retorno de Luis Muñoz Marín, a biography of Puerto Rico’s former governor focusing on the years 1968–1972, as well as several publications examining Puerto Rico’s political status as a U.S. Commonwealth.  

As Resident Commissioner, Pablo José Hernández remains committed to advocating for Puerto Rico's inclusion in federal programs, fostering economic opportunities, and promoting sustainable development for the island.
