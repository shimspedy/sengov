Larry Rhoden is a lifelong West River rancher, a dedicated husband and father, and a proven leader with a record of service for South Dakota. He serves as the 34th Governor of South Dakota.

Larry was elected as lieutenant governor alongside Governor Kristi Noem in 2018 and re-elected in 2022. He rose to the office of governor in January 2025.

Growing up in the church, Larry understood true service at a young age. After graduating high school, he joined the South Dakota National Guard, serving six years and carrying on a family legacy of military service that began in the Revolutionary War. While his children were young, he served as a church trustee, earned a seat on the local school board, and led the Board of Directors for the area Cenex. He currently serves as a Deacon of his home church.

In 2000, Larry was elected to the state legislature. During his time as a citizen legislator, his peers repeatedly selected him to serve in leadership, and he's shown an aptitude for getting things done. Larry served as House Majority Leader and chaired both the Senate and House State Affairs Committees. Larry worked with then-Representative Noem to reform property taxes, led efforts to repeal the so-called "Trucker's Tax," and shaped legislation to defend the 2nd Amendment rights of South Dakotans. His work earned him the American Conservative Union's highest ranking in 2017. He served as Interim Secretary of the South Dakota Department of Agriculture from May 2020 to September 2020 and as South Dakota's Agriculture Ambassador from 2020 to 2025. He has also served as a past President of State Ag and Rural Leaders.

Larry still does custom welding and operates the ranch where he was born and raised. He and his wife, Sandy, have four sons: Jesse, Cody, Reggie, and Tristen; daughters-in-law Sarah, Liz, Jennifer, and Kalen; and seven grandchildren.
