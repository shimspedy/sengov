Liz Cheney is an American lawyer and politician who served as a U.S. Representative from Wyoming from 2017 to 2023. She is the eldest daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Second Lady Lynne Cheney. She worked in the U.S. State Department during the George W. Bush administration and was involved in promoting regime change in Iran and other Middle Eastern countries. She also co-founded a nonprofit organization called Keep America Safe that advocated for a strong national security policy. She ran for the U.S. Senate in Wyoming in 2014 but withdrew from the race. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2016 and became the chair of the House Republican Conference in 2019. She was known for her conservative views on economic, social, and foreign policy issues. She was also one of the few Republicans who openly criticized former President Donald Trump and his role in the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol. She supported Trumpâ€™s second impeachment and was appointed as the vice chair of the House January 6th Committee that investigated the riot. As a result, she faced backlash from Trump and his allies and was removed from her leadership position in the House Republican Conference in 2021. She did not run for reelection in 2022 and became a professor of practice at the University of Virginia Center for Politics in 2023.
