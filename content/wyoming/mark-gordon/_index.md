Mark Gordon was elected Wyoming's 33rd Governor, on Nov. 6, 2018. He was sworn into office on January 7, 2019.

Mark Gordon grew up on the family ranch in Wyoming where he learned the values of hard work and integrity and the importance of working together. As Governor, he brings those values to the table, maintaining his commitment to a Wyoming where its citizens can pursue their dreams while the state retains its unique character. He is a strong believer that Wyoming must chart its own course, and a steadfast defender of its interests to do so.

As a conservative, Governor Gordon has worked tirelessly to set Wyoming on a sustainable fiscal path. He is committed to making government more transparent, accessible, productive and efficient. He believes government is best when it is closest to the people, and is committed to giving local communities the tools they need to thrive. He is a staunch advocate of quality education for all children from bottom to top, K-12 through all forms of post-secondary education, private and public.

Governor Gordon served as Wyoming State Treasurer from October 2012 until January 2019 when he was sworn in as Governor. He was ranked 57 th among the Sovereign Wealth Fund institute’s “most significant and impactful public investor executives” in 2013. During his time in office, he transformed and modernized the management of the state’s financial portfolio, leading in 2016 to Wyoming earning the No. 1 ranking in the United States and No. 3 in the world among all sovereign funds by the Peterson Institute.

Elected Governor in 2018, he has successfully led Wyoming through two of its most significant challenges in decades: the COVID-19 crisis and the most significant decline in mineral revenue in the state’s history. He has spearheaded efforts to diversify all sectors of Wyoming’s economy, including technology, finance, agriculture, energy, including carbon capture and sequestration, research, education and tourism. He is dedicated to continuing to make the state a darn good place to raise kids.

Governor Gordon and his wife Jennie have four grown children – Anne; Aaron with wife Megan; Bea with husband Austen; and Spencer with wife Sarah, their son Everett, and their recent additions of twin daughters Violet and Eloise.
