Congressman Ted Deutch represents Florida’s 22nd district, home to communities in northern Broward County and southeastern Palm Beach County in South Florida. Now serving his seventh term in the 117th Congress, he is the Chairman of the House Ethics Committee, a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, and a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on which he serves as the Chairman of the Middle East, North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism Subcommittee.

Noted by the South Florida Sun Sentinel for his accessible personality, sense of humor, and thoughtful approach to the issues, Ted has proven himself to be an energetic advocate for the priorities of his constituents. Ted’s priorities in the 117th Congress include promoting economic opportunity in South Florida, reducing the influence of big money in our elections, gun violence prevention, fighting for full equality for all, and advancing the security interests of the United States, Israel, and our allies.

Ted and his wife Jill have lived and worked in South Florida since 1997. Prior to holding public office, Ted enjoyed a successful career as a commercial real estate attorney. Born and raised in the working class community of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Ted is the youngest son of the late Jean and Bernard Deutch, a World War II veteran who earned a Purple Heart at the Battle of the Bulge. A graduate of the University of Michigan and the University of Michigan Law School, Ted earned the prestigious Harry S. Truman Scholarship. His passion for serving the community inspired him to run for the Florida State Senate in 2006.

#### House Committee on Foreign Affairs
In January 2021, Congressman Deutch was re-elected to serve as Chairman for the Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. As a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ted is deeply engaged in legislation involving economic sanctions and diplomacy, foreign assistance, national security, global human rights, and an array of other international issues.

#### House Committee on the Judiciary
Serving as a senior member on the House Judiciary Committee has given Congressman Deutch the opportunity to debate important legislative issues, from civil rights and gun violence prevention to campaign finance and criminal law enforcement. The Judiciary Committee has oversight over all legislation involving the administration of the courts, the apportionment of congressional districts, issues surrounding bankruptcy, intellectual property, and counterfeiting, immigration policy and non-border enforcement, national penitentiaries, and other issues.

#### House Committee on Ethics
At the start of the 117th Congress, Democratic leaders tapped Congressman Deutch to Chair the House Ethics Committee for the second term. The House Ethics Committee is the only committee to operate with an equal number of both Democrats and Republicans and a completely nonpartisan staff. The Ethics Committee is charged with enforcing the Official Standards of Conduct, which include rules on gifts, travel, personal income, and other areas.
