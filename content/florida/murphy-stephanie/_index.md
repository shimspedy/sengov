U.S. Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy represents Florida’s Seventh Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. The district includes all of Seminole County and much of northern Orange County, including downtown Orlando, Maitland, Winter Park, and the University of Central Florida. 
 
Congresswoman Murphy is the first Vietnamese-American woman elected to Congress in our nation’s history. She serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, where she is a member of the Subcommittee on Trade and the Subcommittee on Worker and Family Support. She also serves on the House Armed Services Committee, where she is vice chair of the Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations and is a member of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces. In July 2021, Congresswoman Murphy was appointed to serve on the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. 
 
In addition to her committee assignments, Congresswoman Murphy serves as co-chair of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of Democrats focused on fiscal responsibility, a strong national defense, and a principled and pragmatic approach to legislating. Murphy is the first woman of color to lead the Blue Dogs and only the second member in the coalition’s history to serve consecutive leadership terms.
 
Congresswoman Murphy also serves as a Chief Deputy Whip of the House Democratic majority. In this role, she helps Democrats communicate with House leadership so that legislation that comes to the House floor reflects the views of the entire Democratic caucus. As Chief Deputy Whip, Congresswoman Murphy has a seat on the powerful House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which recommends committee assignments to the Democratic caucus and helps shape the House policy agenda.
 
Before her election to Congress, Congresswoman Murphy was a businesswoman, college instructor, and consultant. She served as a national security specialist in the office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, where she received numerous awards for her distinguished service, including the Secretary of Defense Medal for Exceptional Civilian Service. Congresswoman Murphy holds a M.S. in Foreign Service from Georgetown University and a B.A. in Economics from the College of William and Mary. She lives in Winter Park, Florida, with her husband and two young children.
