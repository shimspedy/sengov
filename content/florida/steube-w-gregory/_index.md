Congressman Steube’s life has been defined by Service. Prior to being elected to Congress, Greg served for 2 years in the Florida Senate and 6 years in the Florida House.  However, Greg’s commitment to public service began long before his involvement in politics. Immediately after graduating from the University of Florida with both undergraduate and law degrees, Greg answered the call to serve in the war on terror following the September 11th attacks. Enlisting in the U.S. Army, Greg served with distinction from 2004 to 2008 as an Airborne Infantry Officer and a JAG Corps Officer. Greg served as the Chief of Detainee Operations for Multinational Division North in Iraq with the 25th Infantry Division in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2006-2007.

In Congress, he currently serves on the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committees. Through these committee assignments, Greg has spent time advocating for conservative immigration policies, standing up for our nation’s heroes, and fighting for faith-based values. He is also recognized as a leader in the agriculture community, recognizing the important balance between agriculture and water quality issues surrounding Florida’s Lake Okeechobee.

Greg is frequently interviewed in national and regional media. He has appeared on Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, NBC News, Newsmax TV, One America News Network, NTD News, and News Nation. His legislation is regularly covered by The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The New York Times, POLITICO, The Hill, The Free Beacon, The Washington Times, and The Epoch Times. He often joins conservative thought leaders on nationally syndicated radio shows including The Sean Hannity Show, The Great America Show with Lou Dobbs, Breitbart Radio with Alex Marlow, Washington Watch with Tony Perkins, and The Wilkow Majority.

The 17th District covers all of Charlotte, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Highlands, and Okeechobee counties, along with portions of Lee, Polk, and Sarasota counties. The District’s land area of over 6,300 square miles is home to some of the largest cattle ranches, crops, and citrus farms in the state and is the largest citrus-producing district in the entire nation.

Greg lives in Sarasota with his wife Jennifer, son Ethan and their rescue dogs, Luke, Leia, Chance, and Matty.
