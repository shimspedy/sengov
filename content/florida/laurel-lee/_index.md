Congresswoman Laurel Lee was sworn into office in the United States House of Representatives on January 3, 2023.  She proudly represents the 15th District of Florida which encompasses eastern Hillsborough county including Thonotosassa and Plant City, and part of Brandon, as well as parts of Pasco and Polk counties including Zephyrhills and west Lakeland.

A wife, mother, and daughter of a two-star general in the United States Air Force, Laurel is committed to ensuring that the 15th District of Florida’s voice is represented in Congress. Laurel grew up in a military family, born at the Write-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. As a life-long public servant, Laurel is focused on bringing common-sense solutions to Washington that will encourage job growth, limit government overreach, secure our borders, and bolster our economic and national security.  

Prior to her election to the U.S. House of Representatives, Laurel served as Florida’s 36th Secretary of State under the DeSantis Administration from January 2019 to May 2022. During her tenure, she worked to strengthen Florida’s elections infrastructure and cybersecurity defenses and ensured accurate and secure elections in the state. From 2013-2019, Laurel served as a Circuit Court Judge in Florida’s Thirteenth Judicial Court in Hillsborough County, appointed by then-Governor Rick Scott. Before becoming a judge, she served as a federal prosecutor for the United States Attorney’s Office in the Middle District of Florida. As a federal prosecutor, she investigated and litigated False Claims Act cases and initiated and prosecuted a wide range of criminal offenses, including white-collar crime, violent crime, and offenses involving the sexual exploitation of children.  

Laurel serves on House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees. Her main focus on these committees includes government accountability and transparency and protecting our nation from threats both abroad and at home.  

During her first week in office, Laurel introduced the REINS Act to remove burdensome government regulations for Floridians. This legislation reins in harmful regulations, limits executive overreach, and protects all Americans from unelected and unchecked Washington bureaucrats.  

Laurel is a graduate of the University of Florida where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science in 1996 and received her law degree in 1999. 

Laurel lives in eastern Hillsborough County with her husband, Tom, and their three children.

#### Economy
Because of the Biden Administration, we are facing historic inflation and skyrocketing gas prices that are crippling hardworking Americans. Laurel will fight for policies to get the economy back on track and put more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans, like cutting wasteful spending, lowering taxes, balancing the budget, and reviving the Keystone Pipeline.

Laurel will fight to reverse the failed, left-wing Biden Agenda in Congress, so we can grow our economy, fight inflation, secure America and make us energy independent again.

#### Law Enforcement
Laurel is a former judge and prosecutor who is a strong supporter of law enforcement and will stand up to the radical liberals who want to defund the police.

As a former federal prosecutor, she has seen firsthand the vital role police play in our criminal justice system. They are a critical piece to a law-abiding society, and she believes we must do everything we can to support our law enforcement officers and fully fund law enforcement to keep our streets and communities safe.

#### Second Amendment
Laurel is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. She will always fight to protect the constitutional rights of law-abiding gun owners from radical gun control liberals.

#### Families
Laurel is pro-life and pro-family. She believes so many of the problems we face as a country are due to the breakdown of families and a federal government that is hostile to religious liberty.

#### Immigration
Laurel believes we have an illegal immigration crisis at the southern border. She supports finishing the Trump Border Wall and deporting illegal immigrants who enter the country unlawfully, and she supports the border patrol agents who are under attack by the radical left.

#### Elections
Laurel is the former Florida Secretary of State, appointed by Governor DeSantis, where she worked to strengthen Florida’s election integrity and cyber security and increase voter registration and participation to ensure that Florida has free and fair elections.
