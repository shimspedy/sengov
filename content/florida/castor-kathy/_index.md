Kathy Castor is Tampa Bay’s voice in the U.S. Congress. She was elected in 2006 and represents Florida’s 14th Congressional district, which includes Tampa and parts of Hillsborough County. She is the first woman to represent Hillsborough and Pinellas counties in the U.S. Congress.

Castor focuses on issues vital to Tampa Bay area families and businesses, and is committed to building a stronger economy that works for everyone as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Chair of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. She works on initiatives to create jobs, protect the environment and consumers, improve schools, ensure veterans receive the benefits and care they have earned, provide access to affordable health care and defend protections for people with preexisting health conditions.

Providing better-paying jobs for Tampa Bay is Castor's number 1 priority. She has successfully fought to bring new, good-paying job opportunities to Tampa Bay’s small businesses and large economic engines alike, including Port Tampa Bay, University of South Florida, Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute, Tampa International Airport, MacDill Air Force Base and federally qualified community health centers.

In 2021 alone, her office worked to deliver $2.9 billion in Covid19 grants to support small businesses and nonprofits, including $2.7 billion in Paycheck Protection small business loans, $74.6 million in Restaurant Revitalization Fund awards and $46.8 million in Shuttered Venue Operators Grant; a record $1.9 billion in federal grants secured for this Tampa/Hillsborough congressional district to create jobs, invest in education and infrastructure, and support the important work of local partners as Tampa Bay Builds Back Better; a record $3.4 million recovered for veterans, seniors, small businesses and families of this congressional district who were stuck in red tape before requesting assistance from U.S. Rep. Castor; and thanks to the American Rescue Plan and President Biden, Rep. Castor delivered ~$206M in tax cuts for most families with children (per the new expanded Child Tax Credit) which helped 86,000 Tampa area families at a time they needed it most with child care, groceries, diapers and school supplies.

##### Working to Protect our Environment, Economy and Address the Climate Crisis

Castor has a long established track record of fighting for all that makes Florida special. She started her professional legal career with the Florida Department of Community Affairs working to enforce environmental and growth management laws that protect wetlands, Florida’s coastline, endangered species and sensitive lands.  In private practice, Castor continued her commitment to Florida’s environment as a land use/environmental attorney representing local governments.  As a Hillsborough County Commissioner, Castor served as chair of the Hillsborough County Environmental Protection Commission that is charged with protecting the air, water, wetlands, and land of our large and diverse county, and the delegated elements of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.  

##### Solving the Climate Crisis
In June 2020, led by Chair Castor, Democratic members of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis unveiled a comprehensive plan titled “Solving the Climate Crisis: The Congressional Action Plan for a Clean Energy Economy and a Healthy, Resilient, and Just America.” The report lays out the Climate Crisis Action Plan, full of detailed, ambitious and actionable climate solutions that Congress should enact to benefit American families in communities across the nation.

The Climate Crisis Action Plan calls on Congress to:

- Grow Our Economy and Put Americans Back to Work in Clean Energy Jobs
- Protect the Health of All Families
- Make Sure Our Communities and Farmers Can Withstand the Impacts of Climate Change
- Protect America’s Land and Waters for the Next Generation

Since the release of the Climate Crisis Action Plan, House Democrats have successfully turned more than 200 of the climate solutions in the report into law, while also passing more than half of our 715 climate recommendations.
 
##### No Drilling

U.S. Rep. Castor has introduced legislation to keep oil drilling away from Florida throughout her tenure in Congress, including the bipartisan Protecting and Securing Florida's Coastline Act. She is also the author of the Florida Coastal Protection Act to make the 235-mile drilling ban off of Florida’s west coast permanent, which passed through the House of Representatives.  The Gulf of Mexico BP Horizon disaster was a wake-up call for many who urged “drill, baby, drill.”  She was active and outspoken against BP during the Deepwater Horizon oil blowout disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, which impacted Florida’s beaches, economy and small businesses. That year, she secured $10 million from BP to support Florida college and university marine research, including the University of South Florida and Sarasota’s Mote Marine Laboratory. Castor introduced the Gulf of Mexico Economic and Environmental Restoration Act to fund long-term economic recovery, environmental restoration and research with the fines and penalties to be paid by BP for its pollution under the Clean Water Act. Extensive bipartisan efforts continued on this legislation in 2011, and in June 2012, Gulf Coast states and the Gulf of Mexico achieved a major victory when the RESTORE Act was passed by Congress.

##### Energy

In addition, Castor has championed energy efficiency, distributed energy and environmental justice to ensure ALL communities, families and individuals enjoy the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards. A benchmarking bill for the disclosure of energy information for commercial buildings in the 114th Congress was signed into law as part of The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015. Castor’s Clean Distributed Energy Grid Integration Act was incorporated into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, signed into law November 15, 2021 by President Biden.

##### Disaster Response and Resiliency

In the wake of disasters that have destroyed communities in Florida and across the United States, Castor has been unwavering in pressing for federal emergency aid resources to quickly reach the hardest hit regions. After Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, Castor launched a Puerto Rico Recovery and Assistance Task Force to fight for the resources the island needs to rebuild for resiliency and stronger infrastructure and economy, as well as maximize local resources to serve Puerto Rican families that have relocated to Florida. So that no U.S. region or territory ever again experiences 100 percent power loss, as a member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, Castor has pressed for robust electric generation, grid modernization and resiliency policies.

As Chair of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, Castor is dedicated to solutions that protect our communities from the climate crisis, while we cut the carbon pollution that is causing the climate to change in the first place.

##### Quality, Affordable Health Care

As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee, Castor was instrumental in ensuring that health care reform worked for Florida families, businesses, and university medical and nursing colleges. She helped to draft the landmark Affordable Care Act that passed in 2010, and she has worked tirelessly against weakening new patient protections, especially for neighbors with pre-existing conditions, and educating neighbors about health insurance enrollment in the new marketplace exchange.

Castor has authored legislation to improve children’s health care of the nation’s sickest kids through a “health home” model that launched in her hometown of Tampa, Fla., as well as a bipartisan bill to address the opioid epidemic. Castor remains focused on lowering the cost of prescription drugs; protecting Medicare for seniors; supports expanding Medicaid in the State of Florida; and has authored provisions to remedy the doctor shortage and bring new medical residencies to the state and expand scholarships for medical professions at Florida colleges and universities. Castor works hard to bolster and support our health care institutions -- University of South Florida, Haley VA Hospital, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute, Tampa General Hospital and BayCare.

Castor co-chairs the Academic Medicine Caucus and Children’s Health Care Caucus. 

##### MacDill AFB & Veteran Community

MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. is home to two combatant commands, Special Operations Command and Central Command; the 6th Air Mobility Wing; the 927th Air Refueling Wing; and dozens of mission partners. Castor fights for investment, expansion and support our base’s military missions and personnel need to keep our country safe.

In 2020, provisions Castor championed for our service members were included in the year’s National Defense Authorization Act, including a 3 percent pay raise for our troops and a continued commitment to upgrade base housing for military families. To help ensure the veterans in her district receive the benefits and care they have earned, Castor regularly holds roundtable discussions with veterans and veterans-related nonprofits to address challenges and maximize collaboration.

She is the co-chair of the Air Force Caucus and the Special Operations Forces Caucus

##### Lifting Tampa and Cuban American Families

Castor is also dedicated to improving the lives of Cuban Americans. She successfully advocated to ease travel and spending restrictions on Cuban-Americans visiting relatives in Cuba. In January 2011, President Obama announced that Tampa International Airport's eligibility to resume direct flights to and from Cuba after more than two years of a Castor-led lobbying effort. TIA is now one of the busiest airports in the nation for direct flights to Cuba. In 2013, Castor went on a fact-finding visit to Cuba and has advocated more engagement with the island nation to promote modernization. The Center for Democracy in the Americas presented Castor with the 2013 award for Courage in Congress for her advocacy in changing U.S. policy towards Cuba. The Tampa Bay community, including business and education leaders, have stood with Castor in developing ties and establishing Tampa as a Gateway to Cuba, and boosting cultural and educational exchanges.  In 2014, President Obama announced that the United States would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. Castor continues to work on improving human rights and fostering better economic opportunities in Cuba and in the United States. Castor accompanied President Obama in 2016 in a historic trip to Cuba to cement reinstatement of diplomatic ties. She is a co-chair of the bipartisan Cuba Working Group and the lead Democrat on a bill to end the embargo.

In addition, over the years, Castor has united Tampa Bay behind immigration solutions, including the American Dream and Promise Act. She has held town halls, public meetings and roundtables to bring together legal experts and community resources to highlight the contributions of immigrants to Tampa Bay’s history and the region’s economic success.
