Born in Winter Haven, Florida, Cory Mills is a decorated U.S. Army combat Veteran, and recipient of the Bronze Star.  Cory left Florida to serve his country first in uniform, and then to serve further our U.S. State Department and other government agencies in both Afghanistan and Iraq.

Cory has spent most of his adult life serving our great nation and fighting for the American people, and for those friends of America who have suffered under tyrannical and dictatorship style rule.

He served with the 82nd Airborne Division and was a member of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) 20 in Iraq.  While serving abroad, Cory was struck twice in 2006, once with an improvised explosive device (IED) and once with an Iranian explosively formed projectile (EFP), which resulted in numerous casualties.  Fortunately, Cory was able to stabilize himself prior to evacuation.  For his actions, former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilizad presented Cory Mills with a Certificate of Appreciation from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad for his actions which saved members of his team and U.S. military service members. Cory Mills has nearly 7-years of service in Iraq, approximately 2-years in Afghanistan, served in the Kosovo Campaign in 2000, and has traveled to the front lines of Ukraine during the Russian invasion to provide information for USAID and Department of State officials.  He also supported anti-terrorism assistance training for the Kurdish forces in northern Iraq to help them repel potential insurgencies.

Cory Mills was a Trump appointee to the Pentagon as a Department of Defense (DoD) advisor, and a foreign policy expert you may have seen on Newsmax, Fox News, OANN, and many other media outlets.

In the private sector, Cory co-founded Pacem Solution International LLC and Pacem Defense LLC with his wife, Rana.  Through the PACEM companies, Cory and Rana have supported risk management assessments, intelligence collection, and security for media such as NPR news.  In 2018, Pacem Defense acquired Amtec Less Lethal Systems, Inc., now known as ALS, Inc., in Perry, Florida, to help continue their support to the law enforcement communities and our allies abroad.

Cory is a husband, father, patriot, combat veteran, entrepreneur, foreign policy expert, and true American conservative. Cory believes in FIGHTING for the people, restoring the voice of “We The People” -- America’s voice -- and making America First Again.

Cory is a constitutionalist who believes that the sacred oath he took to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic” does not have an expiration date.
