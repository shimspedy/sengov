Congressman Mike Haridopolos is an experienced leader with a rich history of public service, business success, and a steadfast lifelong commitment to conservative values. 

Mike began his career teaching United States History and Political Science at Brevard Community College—now Eastern Florida State College, and taught classes as an instructor at the Bob Graham Center at the University of Florida.

Representing communities in Brevard County in the Florida House of Representatives and the State Senate from 2000-2012, Mike championed transparency, reduced taxes, and advanced conservative reforms. In the Florida Legislature, Mike quickly established himself as a capable lawmaker who stood firmly rooted in his conservative values, and pushed for greater government transparency and accountability for Floridians, leading the effort to put the state’s budget online. In 2008, he sponsored and championed Florida’s constitutional amendment reducing property taxes and allowing homeowners to bring their tax savings with them when they move to a new home. 

Serving as President of the Senate from 2010-2012, Mike made transforming the Florida Senate into a more conservative policy body a key objective of his time in office.

After leaving office in 2012, Haridopolos started a successful business and political consulting company. He was elected to represent Florida’s 8th Congressional District in 2024, following the retirement of Congressman Bill Posey. 

Mike lives in Indian Harbour Beach with his wife Dr. Stephanie Haridopolos. They have three adult children, Alexis, Hayden and Reagan. Mike is dedicated to serving Brevard, Indian River, and Orange Counties with integrity, strength and vision.
