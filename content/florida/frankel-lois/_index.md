From her days as a working mom and now as she describes herself—a working grandmother, Congresswoman Lois Frankel has spent her life delivering positive change to her community as a civic leader, state legislator, mayor, and now Member of the United States House of Representatives. Currently, she sits on the House Appropriations Committee and on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which is personal to her as a proud mom of a brave Marine war veteran. 

A trailblazer in the Florida State Legislature, Lois served as the first woman Democratic minority leader. She became a leading force to improve the economic condition of families and seniors, and to protect human rights and women's reproductive freedom - fights she continues today in Congress as co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus.

Prior to her election to Congress, Lois served as Mayor of West Palm Beach, raising her city to a new vitality and earning a reputation as an innovative problem solver.

On a personal note, Lois is an avid abstract painter who is very proud of her son, and even more proud to be “Lolo” to her grandsons.
