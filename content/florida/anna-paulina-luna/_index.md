Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna is serving her first term as the Representative for Florida’s Thirteenth Congressional District. Rep. Luna is a member of the House Freedom Caucus and the Congressional Second Amendment Caucus.

Rep. Luna is the first Mexican-American woman elected to the United States Congress to represent Florida. Raised by a single mother in one of Southern California’s low-income neighborhoods, Anna’s rough upbringing taught her the importance of hard work and independence. She also firsthand experienced the devastating consequences of radical big-government policies in cities like the one she grew up in. 

Anna joined the military at a young age to leave behind the life of America's low-income, inner-city communities. She would go on to graduate from the University of West Florida with a bachelor’s degree in biology. While serving in the United States Air Force, Anna met her husband, Andy Gamberzky – a bronze star recipient who earned a Purple Heart when enemy combatants shot at him in Afghanistan. 

Anna believes that the “business as usual” mentality in Washington has ruined the lives of everyday Americans, who are failed by decades of leaders who do not truly value them for anything more than their votes. In Congress, Anna will always fight against the elitist political establishment that has, for far too long, left the American people behind.

Congresswoman Luna resides in St. Petersburg, with her husband Andy.
