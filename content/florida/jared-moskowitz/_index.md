Moskowitz answered the call of public service and was elected to the Parkland City Commission when he was in law school. Right away, he began working for the people he was elected to serve by putting forward and delivering on pragmatic solutions regarding public safety and environmental protection.

In 2012, Moskowitz was elected to the Florida Legislature, where he worked across party lines to deliver for his constituents, including passing bipartisan measures to make Florida’s schools safer, address climate change, support Israel, and implement animal welfare legislation.

When 17 people died in the mass shooting at his alma mater, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, he championed the movement to pass meaningful reforms.  As a State Representative, he worked with the families of the victims and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to enact historic gun violence prevention legislation, raising the age to buy guns from 18 to 21 and putting in place “red flag laws” giving law enforcement the power to take away firearms from those too dangerous to responsibly possess them. He also championed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, the most comprehensive gun violence prevention, school safety, and mental health bill ever passed in Florida.

In 2019, Moskowitz was appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis to be Florida’s Director of Emergency Management. As director, he was responsible for disaster recovery efforts throughout the state.  Most notably, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 storm.  During the height of the COVID pandemic, Moskowitz established testing programs, the vaccine rollout, and administered the distribution of millions of personal protective equipment to communities and hospitals across the state.

Most recently, Moskowitz served as a Broward County Commissioner. In this position, he worked to improve affordable housing, invest in critical infrastructure, expand public transportation, enhance public safety, and address quality-of-life issues on behalf of his constituents.

Moskowitz is now a dedicated representative to the constituents of Florida’s 23rd Congressional District. During his first term, Moskowitz worked tirelessly on initiatives to address gun violence, defend our democracy, strengthen support for Israel, and protect women’s reproductive freedom. Currently, Moskowitz serves on the House Oversight Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as well as the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump. Additionally, Moskowitz serves as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Sneaker Caucus, Co-Chair of the Congressional Dog Lovers’ Caucus, Vice Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and member of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combatting Antisemitism.

#### Defending Democracy
Donald Trump and extremist Republicans have been on a mission to disenfranchise voters, weaken democratic institutions, undermine the rule of law and sow unfounded doubts about the legitimacy of our electoral system and processes. Jared will fight back, ensuring that American democracy is insulated from Trumpism and placed on a safer path than the one which ultimately led us to the horrific events of January 6th, 2021. He will support election security at the national level, advocate for reforms to stop gerrymandering and ensure minority representation, make Election Day a national holiday, universalize vote by mail, and standardize the process by which elections are certified in order to blunt GOP attempts to invalidate them.

#### Preventing Gun Violence
When 17 people died in the mass shooting at Jared’s alma mater, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, he championed the movement to pass meaningful reforms through the Florida Legislature in order to make sure a tragedy like this could never happen again in the Sunshine State. As a State Representative, he worked with the families of the victims and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide to enact historic gun violence prevention legislation raising the age to buy guns from 18 to 21 and putting in place “red flag laws” giving law enforcement the power to take away firearms from those too dangerous to responsibly possess them. In Congress, Jared will fight to make this law a model for the nation and to ban assault weapons.

#### Safeguarding Reproductive Rights
As a State Legislator, Jared fought against attempts to restrict abortion rights. When the draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked, he immediately called on the U.S. Senate to bypass the filibuster and codify Roe into law. In Congress, he will be committed to making sure reproductive rights are protected by the federal government and that we continue the fight for health care equity.

#### Standing up for the LGBTQ+ Community
Love is love. As hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community continue to rise, Jared is focused on fighting against bigotry and stigmas. In Congress, Jared will be a strong ally to the LGBTQ+ community, advocating for anti-discrimination policies and safeguarding marriage equality, just as he did in the FL legislature. He will also continue sponsorship of Congressman Deutch’s Ruthie and Connie LGBT Elder Americans Act.

#### Protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Obamacare
The GOP is working overtime in Washington to gut three of the most popular government initiatives on which Americans rely: Social Security, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act – but Jared won’t let them. In Congress, he’ll fight to expand Medicare, protect Social Security, and reduce prescription drug costs. He will also work to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, which has extended coverage to millions in our country – including those with preexisting conditions who previously had no access to the care they needed.

#### Standing Up For Israel
Jared’s great-grandparents were killed at Auschwitz, and his grandparents barely escaped Europe before the war. Today, antisemitism is on the rise globally and the U.S.-Israel relationship is more important than ever. Jared is 100% committed to continuing U.S. military assistance to Israel; keeping the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem; and strengthening economic, diplomatic and military ties with Israel. He is a staunch fighter against the BDS movement and will work to stop antisemitism in all its forms.

#### Fighting for Affordability
South Florida has become one of the country’s least affordable communities. In Congress, Jared is committed to taking concrete actions to reduce the cost of living when it comes to housing, property insurance, inflation, gasoline, groceries, and other basic household goods. That’s why on the Broward County Commission, Jared recently advocated for over 1,000 new affordable housing units. In Congress, he’ll fight for lower gas prices, more federal funds for workforce housing, and renter protection initiatives to crack down on bad actors.

#### Economic Stability and Opportunities
Inflation is just one barrier to families’ economic success. Congress should work to create new opportunities to financially empower and include all Americans. Jared will advocate for financial innovations and new technologies that advance economic justice, provide increased accessibility to new tools and opportunities, and make financial policies more inclusive. In short, he is dedicated to providing greater access to opportunity. Jared will propel these ideas by supporting innovative legislative measures such as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA), while also ensuring that Congress appropriately promotes competition for emerging and novel technologies. A more secure and competitive digital marketplace that incorporates cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies will secure America’s economy for the next generation. Jared will work to create new economic opportunities, expand entrepreneurship programs, and invest in local economies to create jobs.

#### Protecting the Environment
We’re living through a climate crisis that threatens our way of life, and we must act quickly to mitigate the effects of climate change. Investing in environmental protection isn’t just a long-term plan towards clean air, clean water, and sustainability, it’s also a way to reinvigorate the economy and create jobs in our community. Jared was a consistent advocate for environmental causes as a State Representative, and he will fight for bold policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, convert to clean energy sources, protect the Everglades, and make our community more resilient against environmental threats.

#### Preventing the Next Pandemic
When COVID-19 first emerged, we all saw how unprepared the United States was for a health crisis of its magnitude. As Florida’s Director of Emergency Management, Jared worked hard to respond to the unprecedented challenges Florida faced by accelerating the statewide vaccine distribution network to ensure families across the state were protected. He brought vaccines to senior living facilities, 250+ Black and Hispanic churches, HUD housing, immigrant communities, Holocaust Survivors, and other vulnerable communities. In Congress, Jared will prioritize critical vaccine research, biosecurity for gene synthesis, proper safety protocols around research of concern, supply chain issues, PPE production, and pandemic-proof infrastructure as ways to mitigate COVID-19 and prevent the next pandemic. This also means increasing common sense safety and security measures, like better regulation of gain of function research. Our public health professionals, scientists, and researchers are ready to advance this science and technology, and we need to empower them by fully funding pandemic prevention and preparedness research at the federal level.
