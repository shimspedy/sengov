Matt Gaetz, a member of the 118th Congress, is currently serving his fourth term in the U.S. House of Representatives. He is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. His work in Congress focuses on national security, veterans’ affairs, and adherence to constitutional principles.

From Florida to D.C., Matt has lived up to his reputation as an outspoken conservative firebrand. Matt has been a prominent voice for uncovering corruption within the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation during his tenure in the US House, as well as fighting to advance former President Trump’s America First agenda for the United States on the House floor, on television, directly to his constituents during “Open Gaetz Days” or town halls, and most recently in a nation-wide America First tour.

During the Russia Hoax and subsequent partisan impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Matt was a staunch defender of the President and a fierce advocate for his acquittal. Matt spearheaded the charge for transparency during the Democrats’ partisan impeachment depositions by leading over fifty Republican colleagues into their secretive, closed-door impeachment inquiry to observe the proceedings.

Matt was a tireless defender of President Trump and his vision for the United States during the Trump Administration, and continues to defend the former president. He has earned nicknames such as the “Trumpiest Congressman in Trump’s Washington” by GQ magazine and “the Trumpiest Congressman” by Rolling Stone, which he considers badges of honor.

Matt has authored key pieces of legislation on foreign policy, veterans’ health care, immigration, climate change, and more during his time in office. In 2019, Matt introduced the “Green Real Deal,” a plan to address climate change by harnessing the power of free markets, embracing technological innovation and entrepreneurship, and cutting excessive governmental red tape. In 2020, he introduced the “PANDEMIC Act,” which mandates the deportation of all illegal aliens held in the United States when a national emergency related to a communicable disease is declared, and in 2020 he authored the “Ainsworth Act,” which allows centenarian military veterans to qualify for full pension benefits from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs regardless of their net worth.

Since Northwest Florida is home to strategic military installations such as Eglin AFB, Hurlburt Field, and NAS Pensacola, Matt has made it a priority to ensure the military has extraordinary capabilities to protect America. During the FY2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Matt secured numerous provisions, including an amendment to increase the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) to service members in the district, and a $600 million in funding for Military Construction Projects throughout the district and enhancements to the Gulf Test Range.

Matt graduated from Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, with a bachelor’s degree in interdisciplinary sciences. After finishing his undergraduate studies, Matt moved to Williamsburg, Virginia, to attend William & Mary Law School, where he received his Juris Doctorate.

Prior to serving in Congress, Matt worked as an attorney in Northwest Florida with the Keefe, Anchors & Gordon law firm, where he advocated for a more open and transparent government. In 2010, Matt was elected to serve in the Florida House of Representatives to represent portions of Okaloosa and Santa Rosa county. He was chairman of the Finance and Tax Committee, where he authored and passed $1 billion in tax cuts, all while balancing the state budget and repealing or replacing over 4,000 regulations. Matt also served as chairman of the Criminal Justice Subcommittee, where he authored and passed some of America’s toughest penalties against violent sexual predators.

Matt was born in Hollywood, Florida, to Don and Vicky Gaetz and grew up in Northwest Florida. He is a member of First Baptist Church in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Matt is married to Ginger Gaetz and has one son, Nestor, who he has described raising as “the most rewarding thing I’ve done in my life.”

#### Congress
Matt Gaetz is one of former President Donald Trump's top allies in Washington and has long been an ardent critic of the Mueller Witch Hunt. Matt is not afraid to call out the Fake News Media in their attempts to tear down Conservatives and the America First Agenda. Former President Trump has called Matt an "Absolute Warrior," and GQ called him "The Trumpiest Congressman in Trump's Washington." When Matt sees corruption and agenda-pushing by the out-of-touch liberal elite, he takes action.

#### Education
Parents and teachers, not bureaucrats, know what's best for our students, and Matt successfully sponsored legislation allowing local school districts to opt out of Common Core textbook requirements. Matt is committed to improving school safety in a bipartisan manner, because nothing should divide us when it comes to protecting our children.

#### Energy
Rep. Gaetz believes we should continue to encourage innovation in clean energy solutions, and has proposed a "Green Real Deal" for America that promotes these solutions.

#### Environment
Florida's environment is known world-wide for our vibrant Everglades, rich fisheries, and pristine beaches. The environment is an enormous factor of our economy, and contributes directly to the livlihood of millions of Floridians. In the 115th Congress, Congressman Gaetz joined the Climate Solutions Caucus, which explores solutions to environmental issues such as climate change and global warming. Congressman Gaetz is commited to seeking creative solutions to protecting our environment without inviting the federal government to impose burdonsome regulations on our citizens.

#### Foreign Affairs
America must lead on the world stage, or someone else will. It is imperative that we lead through diplomacy and strong defense policies.

In 2018, Matt secured a $41.9 million authorization to fund military test ranges, including our local Gulf Test Range. This allocation will not only ensure that the U.S. has the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen, but also keeps great paying jobs in our community. Keeping the American people safe at home and abroad is the Federal government's most important duty. Matt knows that a well-trained and fully-funded military is critical in ensuring our national security and fighting terrorism. We must project global strength and send our enemies a clear message that we will not tolerate any acts that threaten our safety and security.

#### What is the Green Real Deal?
The Green Real Deal is a strategy linked to legislative proposals that can gain broad, bipartisan support. Climate change is too big for one political party to solve alone. We must address it as a nation, rather than lecture from the ivory towers of our own piety.

Let's start by modernizing our electric grid. The American Society of Civil Engineers graded our grid D+. Today's grid cannot accommodate fluctuation in capacity, utilization, and availability of our existing renewable portfolio — much less an expanded use of renewables. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory argues that today's renewable energy technology, coupled with upgraded grid technology, could result in renewable energy meeting 80 percent of America's energy needs by 2050.

To unlock the potential of American innovation, grid upgrades will facilitate "net metering," which allows property owners, shopping centers, hospitals, and schools to sell energy they create back to the grid. This creates incentives for corporations to maximize renewable energy production and allows homeowners to lower or eliminate their energy costs by embracing renewable energy.

The grid isn't the only platform ripe for innovation. The federal government owns 640 million acres of land. Reps. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and Raul Grijalva (D-N.M.) have both drafted legislations to harvest more renewable energy on public lands. It's a bipartisan no-brainer.

The GND assumes that investment in clean energy demands more government. But here, less government is the answer. Today's cheapest, cleanest energy comes from hydropower. A pro-hydro agenda should cut the maze of red tape. More hydropower means lower costs for consumers, while reducing carbon emissions.

Legacy government-control doctrine also constrains zero-emissions nuclear innovation, particularly where it can replace dirty coal. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission favors big, expensive light-water reactors that cost billions. The NRC won't fairly consider smaller, reliable modular reactors built at a fraction of the cost, limiting the availability of nuclear power to disadvantaged and rural communities lacking a robust payer base. A more libertarian, technologically inclusive policy would democratize nuclear use, reduce carbon emissions, and allow American companies to capture the global modular-nuclear market.

The GRD rejects the fiction that Washington alone can solve problems. States should be encouraged to create tax incentives for energy production and efficiency upgrades, as Florida has. By supporting individual responsibility over government control, every American can be rewarded when the carbon footprint shrinks.

America's solar technology once led the world. Not anymore. China stole American intellectual property, replicated our products, and undercut American solar companies. President Trump's tariffs against Chinese solar panels were a good start, but we must become more aggressive in defense of American innovators.

#### Health
Matt is committed to solving the country's opioid epidemic, promoting research for medicial cannibis, expanding healthcare options and protecting life in the womb.

#### Jobs and the Economy
Congress could learn a thing or two from Florida's economic recovery, where Matt has voted to repeal over 4,000 burdensome regulations and cut taxes over 50 times, totaling over $1 billion in savings for Floridians. That commitment has made Florida a leader in job growth, with unemployment at its lowest rate in 8 years. In Congress, Matt supports our President Trump's "America First" policy to bring jobs and revenue back from overseas.

#### Judiciary
Congressman Gaetz has served on the House Judiciary Committee since the 115th Congress. His work defending President Trump on the House Judiciary Committee has earned him the title of "Absolute Warrior."

This standing committee was established in 1813 by the House of Representatives and has since expanded its role from strictly judicial legislative matters to "the administration of justice in federal courts, administrative bodies, and law enforcement agencies. courts, law enforcement agencies."

#### Law Enforcement
Law Enforcement heroes place their lives on the line every day to protect our community. Congressman Gaetz has sponsored several pieces of legislation to protect our men and women in law enforcement, including the Wounded Officers Recovery Act of 2017, The American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017, and the Rapid DNA Act of 2017.

#### Military
Irresponsibly cutting defense spending is a national security risk that won't solve our budget crisis. We must cut spending and balance our budget with long-term solutions—not on the backs of our service members and defense community. Matt will always stand up for our military community, and opposes any automatic cuts to defense spending that would jeopardize our national security and damage the Northwest Florida economy.

In 2018, Matt secured a $41.9 million authorization to fund military test ranges, including our local Gulf Test Range. This allocation will not only ensure that the U.S. has the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen, but also keeps great paying jobs in our community. Keeping the American people safe at home and abroad is the Federal government's most important duty. Matt knows that a well-trained and fully-funded military is critical in ensuring our national security and fighting terrorism. We must project global strength and send our enemies a clear message that we will not tolerate any acts that threaten our safety and security.

#### Religious Liberty
Matt is passionate about ensuring the free exercise of religion is preserved and protected from unconstitutional government overreach and liberal judicial activism.

#### Veterans
Northwest Florida is home to strategic military installations such as Eglin AFB, Hurlburt Field, and Pensacola NAS. Home to diverse mission sets like Special Operations, Test and Evaluation, and training the next generation of pilots, we owe our freedom to the brave men and women that serve in Florida's First District. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Matt has fought for increased funding for the F-35 program to ensure its extraordinary capabilities are protecting our Nation as quickly as possible. He has also worked to enhance readiness by securing $27.4 million to fund Gulf Coast Test Range enhancements that will enable our aviators to train on up-to-date technology as well as continue critical testing of air-to-air missiles, drone targeting, and hypersonic weapons.

In the FY19 National Defense Authorization Act passed by the House of Representatives in May, Matt secured authorization for $31.9 million in further funding for Gulf Coast Test Range Enhancements, $10 million for an Air Traffic Control Tower at NAS Whiting Field, and $60 million for F-35 spares. He will continue to be an advocate for our military to ensure it is ready and able to fight the wars of today and tomorrow.
When it comes to caring for our veterans Matt has worked diligently to improve the quality of care America's heroes receive. He supported the Choice Act which provided an additional $2.1 billion in mandatory funding for the Veterans Choice Program. This program allows veterans to be seen by a community provider if the VA cannot provide care in a timely manner. Matt has also worked with the VA on reducing missed appointments by using ride share apps, using Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment for Traumatic Brain Injuries and PTSD, and using Telemedicine options for treating mental health.
