#### biograph
As the 65th Governor of Mississippi, Tate Reeves continues to build on his strong record as a conservative leader who fights to guard taxpayers’ dollars, improve educational opportunity, and grow new careers so that our state’s best and brightest can raise their families and thrive here at home.

In his inaugural address, Governor Reeves promised that this would be an administration for all Mississippi. He committed to a mission to create a climate where good careers are plentiful with every Mississippian prepared to pursue them, as he has every single day of his time serving our state.

Upon taking office, Governor Reeves inherited a crumbling corrections department and a scandal-plagued human services department. He took immediate action to stem the existing issues and begin the process of rebuilding, shedding light on the issues and installing the best leadership to help him turn the departments around to work for the people of Mississippi.

While tackling the inherited issues within government agencies to provide for the safety and human dignity of all Mississippians, Governor Reeves simultaneously led our state through historic flooding and tornadoes and a worldwide pandemic—all within his first 100 days in office.

Governor Reeves has continued to make history throughout his public service career. When elected in 2003 for his first public office, Governor Reeves became the youngest state treasurer in our country and the first Republican to hold the office in Mississippi. His business training in the banking sector made him our state’s foremost advocate for balancing the state budget while minimizing state debt.

He was elected in 2011 and re-elected four years later as the 32nd Lieutenant Governor, leading the Mississippi Senate. His conservative management helped fill our state’s Rainy Day Fund to over $550 million—the most in state history—and reduce the overall debt burden. He fought for transparency in how agencies spend tax dollars and stronger reporting requirements on taxpayer-funded incentive programs.

His commitment to long-term growth that creates better careers led Governor Reeves to propose the largest tax cut in state history through the Taxpayer Pay Raise Act, lowering the personal income tax and enabling more Mississippi employers to invest in jobs and better compete in the global marketplace.

Governor Reeves’ upbringing in Florence’s public schools made him driven to reform the education system to increase opportunity for all Mississippians. He has worked to increase investment in the classroom and enacted reforms to save money, strengthen achievement, and effectively communicate school performance. His new mission for our state is to give us more national board-certified teachers per capita than any state in the nation.

Governor Reeves remains committed to his inaugural promise to defend the loving culture that underpins our quality of life and grow our economy that lifts all of our families. He has pledged to work every day to make that promise a reality for all Mississippi.

A Rankin County native, Governor Reeves is a graduate of Florence High School and an honors graduate of Millsaps College, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics. He holds the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.

Governor Reeves and his wife, Elee, are the proud parents of three daughters, Tyler, Emma, and Maddie.

#### Economic Growth

A strong economy is a core foundation of a healthy society. Since first taking public office in 2004, Governor Reeves has worked tirelessly to craft sensible policies that will grow Mississippi’s economy and improve the quality of life for all Mississippians.

Thanks to the smart, conservative policies that Governor Reeves implemented, Mississippi is in the best fiscal and financial shape in our state’s history. He championed a historic tax cut that bolstered job growth and attracted new businesses across the state. Governor Reeves worked to reduce Mississippi’s debt and fill our state’s Rainy Day Fund at the highest level in state history in case of disaster.

Now as Governor, he is executing policies that will continue to build Mississippi’s economic growth, attract new businesses, and create an economic environment that ensures all Mississippians thrive here at home.

#### Workforce Development
The bedrock of a successful economy is a skilled workforce that can adapt to evolving industry trends and attract new businesses. That is why Governor Reeves has prioritized workforce development throughout his tenure in public service.

During a time of economic downturn, Mississippi has experienced great success bringing in new businesses and more jobs to the Hospitality State. That is due in large part to innovative, conservative policies enacted by Governor Reeves to revolutionize Mississippi’s workforce and keep our skilled workers here in Mississippi, where they can obtain high-paying, meaningful careers right here at home.

Every day, Governor Reeves continues working to develop a competitive, skilled workforce that will lead to economic growth for years to come.

#### Education
For the past decade, Governor Reeves has fought to improve Mississippi’s education system. As a result, Mississippi has been a shining example in recent years that smart, conservative policies work in education.

In 2019, Mississippi students led the nation in educational gains in reading and math. We have significantly improved testing scores while the rest of the nation has remained stagnant. Graduation rates have risen dramatically in Mississippi, surpassing all experts’ expectations. Education groups all across the country are looking to Mississippi and asking themselves how they can replicate the success happening in the Hospitality State.

Governor Reeves is committed to continuing that success that he helped champion while leading the Mississippi Senate.

#### Public Safety and Criminal Justice
Public safety is essential for a society to thrive and prosper, which is why Governor Reeves has made the safety of Mississippians and criminal justice reform top priorities throughout his time serving our state.

From fighting to improve benefits for law enforcement officers to reforming Mississippi’s prison system, Governor Reeves is committed to fostering an environment to provide for the safety of all Mississippians and the human dignity of all within the system.

Governor Reeves also believes every Mississippian has the right to bear arms and protect his or her family, which is why he has always been a strong, steady advocate for protecting Second Amendment rights in Mississippi. As long as he is in office, Governor Reeves will fight against any efforts to limit Mississippians’ right to protect their loved ones.

#### Healthcare

States across the country are looking to Mississippi and trying to replicate our success in implementing innovative telehealth technology. Governor Reeves has worked for years to strengthen the telemedicine capabilities in Mississippi in order to offer high-quality, affordable healthcare access to all Mississippians, regardless of where they live.

In the wake of COVID-19, Governor Reeves worked tirelessly with the state health department, national and state health experts, and the Trump Administration to ensure the effectiveness of our data-driven, measured strategy to mitigate the pandemic’s impact on public health.

Governor Reeves is committed to continue increasing Mississippians’ access to quality healthcare and improving public health by promoting smart, conservative policies that ensure the health and well-being of all who call Mississippi home.
