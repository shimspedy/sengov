### About Gov Tate Reeves
Tate Reeves is a product of small-town Mississippi and a lifelong Mississippian. A strong conservative, Tate’s leadership in state government has focused on the principles of guarding taxpayers’ dollars, improving educational opportunity, and growing new careers so our state’s best and brightest can stay in Mississippi.

Tate is pro-life and is committed to protecting the rights of the unborn. He is committed to defending our Second Amendment and will fight Washington liberals who try to take those rights away.

Tate’s business training in the banking sector made him the state’s foremost advocate for balancing the state budget while minimizing state debt. His conservative management helped fill the state’s “rainy day fund” and reduce our overall debt burden. Tate’s upbringing in Florence’s public schools drove him to reform the education system to increase opportunity.

A father of three and a husband to another small-town Mississippian, the former Elee Williams of Tylertown, Tate Reeves is dedicated to creating a future Mississippi in which all our children have the ability to thrive and stay at home to raise their children.
