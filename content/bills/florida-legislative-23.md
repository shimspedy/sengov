Recent legislative changes in Florida encompass a wide array of issues, reflecting the state's diverse policy priorities. Here's a detailed overview:

1. **Abortion**: The new legislation, SB 300, significantly alters abortion laws in Florida, now limiting abortions to within six weeks of pregnancy. This comes with a caveat: the restriction will be implemented only if the Florida Supreme Court decides that the privacy clause in the state's Constitution does not protect abortion rights. This represents a notable shift from the previous 15-week limit, marking a substantial change in the state's stance on reproductive rights.

2. **Affordable Housing**: SB 102 addresses the critical issue of housing affordability. This legislation is aimed at making housing more accessible for workers. It includes measures to incentivize investments in affordable housing projects and encourages the development of mixed-use spaces in commercial areas. This move reflects a growing recognition of the housing challenges facing Florida's workforce and a legislative effort to alleviate these pressures.

3. **State Budget**: The passing of a record $117 billion budget for the fiscal year 2023-2024 marks a significant financial milestone for the state. Included in this budget is HB 7063, a comprehensive tax package featuring several sales-tax holidays and a reduction in the commercial-lease tax. These measures indicate a strategic approach to fiscal policy, with potential implications for both consumers and businesses.

4. **Death Penalty**: With SB 450, Florida has revised its approach to death penalty sentencing. The legislation eliminates the previous requirement for a unanimous jury recommendation before a death sentence can be imposed. The threshold has been lowered, now requiring recommendations from only eight of the 12 jurors. This change has profound implications for capital punishment cases in the state, altering the dynamics of jury deliberations in such trials.

5. **Election Laws**: The enactment of SB 7050 introduces additional constraints on voter registration groups and relaxes campaign-finance reporting requirements. It also amends the "resign to run" law, potentially impacting future political candidacies. This legislation is part of ongoing debates and actions surrounding election laws, reflecting the contentious and evolving nature of electoral politics in Florida.

6. **Gun Laws**: Florida has taken a significant step in gun legislation with HB 543, allowing residents to carry guns without the need for a concealed-weapons license. This policy, commonly referred to as "constitutional carry," marks a departure from the state's longstanding licensing process and represents a substantial shift in gun rights and regulation.

7. **Immigration**: SB 1718 targets federal border policies by increasing requirements for businesses to verify the immigration status of their workers. It also mandates the collection of data regarding the legal status of hospital patients. This legislation is indicative of Florida's proactive stance on immigration issues, particularly in response to federal policies.

8. **Lawsuit Limits**: Business and insurance sectors have seen a legislative win with the approval of HB 837. This law is designed to shield these entities from expensive lawsuits by introducing changes such as reducing the time allowed for filing negligence lawsuits. The law reflects a legislative effort to balance the interests of businesses with those of plaintiffs.

9. **LGBTQ Issues**: A series of bills, including SB 254, were passed that directly impact the LGBTQ community. These laws bar doctors from providing certain medical treatments, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, to transgender minors. Additionally, there's an expansion of the prohibition on instruction about gender identity and sexual orientation in schools. These legislative actions have stirred significant public discussion and debate regarding rights and education.

10. **School Vouchers**: In a major education policy shift, HB 1 was passed, extending eligibility for taxpayer-funded vouchers to all students. These vouchers can be used for private-school tuition and other educational expenses. This legislation removes previous income requirements in voucher programs, potentially reshaping the educational landscape in Florida by increasing access to private education options.

Additional legislative actions further illustrate the range of issues addressed in the recent session:

- **Antisemitism**: A new law targets actions against religious practices or properties, classifying certain offenses as a third-degree felony or hate crime.

- **Campus Free Speech**: New requirements have been set for universities in managing debates and other campus forums, with a focus on protecting free speech.

- **Child Autopsies**: A law has been passed to protect the privacy of minors in domestic violence cases by restricting the public release of autopsy reports.

- **Defamation**: Bills aimed at making it easier to sue news outlets for defamation made initial progress but did not pass.

- **Gainesville Regional Utilities**: The governance structure of Gainesvilleâ€™s city-owned utility has been restructured.

- **Natural Gas Expansion**: A legislative effort to alter how customers contribute financially to natural gas facility construction did not pass.

- **School Start Times**: Legislation proposing delayed start times for middle and high school students was put forward.

- **Teacher Unions**: A new law requires teacher unions to secure 60% of dues-paying members to maintain collective bargaining rights, up from the previous 50% threshold.
