#### Bill Summaries 
This bill imposes a national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services in lieu of the current income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes. The rate of the sales tax will be 23% in 2025, with adjustments to the rate in subsequent years. There are exemptions from the tax for used and intangible property; for property or services purchased for business, export, or investment purposes; and for state government functions.

Under the bill, family members who are lawful U.S. residents receive a monthly sales tax rebate (Family Consumption Allowance) based upon criteria related to family size and poverty guidelines.

The states have the responsibility for administering, collecting, and remitting the sales tax to the Treasury.

Tax revenues are to be allocated among
- the general revenue
- the old-age and survivors insurance trust fund
- the disability insurance trust fund
- the hospital insurance trust fund
- the federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund

No funding is authorized for the operations of the Internal Revenue Service after FY2027.

Finally, the bill terminates the national sales tax if the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution (authorizing an income tax) is not repealed within seven years after the enactment of this bill.

The proposed bill replaces current income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes with a national sales tax on the use or consumption of taxable property or services in the United States. The rate of the tax will be 23% in 2025, with adjustments in later years. Some exemptions apply, such as for used and intangible property, business purchases, and state government functions.

A monthly sales tax rebate called the Family Consumption Allowance will be given to lawful U.S. resident family members, based on their family size and poverty status. The states are responsible for collecting and remitting the sales tax to the Treasury.

Revenues from the sales tax will be divided among general revenue, the old-age and survivors insurance trust fund, the disability insurance trust fund, the hospital insurance trust fund, and the federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund.

After FY2027, no funding is authorized for the operations of the Internal Revenue Service. The national sales tax will be terminated if the Sixteenth Amendment, which authorizes an income tax, is not repealed within seven years of the bill's enactment.

the bill proposes a national sales tax on the use of taxable property or services, with exemptions and rebates, and gives the responsibility of collection and remittance to the states. Revenues will be allocated among different trust funds and the national sales tax will be terminated if the Sixteenth Amendment is not repealed.

The bill is expected to have a significant impact on the tax system in the United States, with the introduction of a national sales tax and the elimination of various other taxes. While the monthly sales tax rebate for families may help offset the impact of the sales tax, it remains to be seen how the states will handle the administration and collection responsibilities. The termination of the national sales tax if the Sixteenth Amendment is not repealed within seven years adds an element of uncertainty to the future of the tax system.

It is important to note that this bill is just a proposal and has not been enacted into law. The actual impact of the bill will depend on the final form that it takes if it is passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.

the proposed national sales tax bill has the potential to significantly change the tax system in the United States, with a focus on a consumption tax instead of various other taxes. The impact on individuals, businesses, and the economy will depend on the specifics of the final bill and its implementation.

It's also worth considering the potential effects of the proposed national sales tax on different segments of the population. Low-income families may be disproportionately impacted by the sales tax, especially if the rebates do not fully offset their consumption. On the other hand, businesses and individuals who purchase items for investment, export, or business purposes may see a decrease in their tax burden.

Additionally, the elimination of the IRS and the responsibility for collection being shifted to the states may lead to complications and discrepancies in the administration of the sales tax. The termination clause in the bill may also create an uncertain environment for businesses and individuals, as it is unclear what the future of the tax system would look like if the Sixteenth Amendment is not repealed.

In the end, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of the proposed national sales tax on various groups and the overall economy. Before any final decisions are made, it is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of such a system and carefully consider the implications for all parties involved.
