The concurrent resolution denounces the horrors of socialism. The resolution states that socialist ideology results in the concentration of power which has frequently led to the establishment of communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships. The resolution highlights the fact that many of the worst crimes in history have been committed by socialist ideologues, including Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, and others. The resolution also mentions the devastating consequences of the implementation of socialism in various countries, such as the Bolshevik Revolution, the USSR gulags, the famine and devastation caused by the Great Leap Forward in China, the killing fields in Cambodia, and the current state of Venezuela.

The resolution quotes President Thomas Jefferson and President James Madison, both of whom believed in the sanctity of the individual and opposed the collectivistic system of socialism. The resolution concludes by stating that Congress denounces socialism in all its forms and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States of America. The resolution was passed by the House of Representatives on February 2, 2023.

In summary, the concurrent resolution is a formal statement by Congress condemning the ideology of socialism and its disastrous consequences. The resolution highlights the fact that socialist policies have resulted in mass killings, famine, and economic failure, and emphasizes the belief in individual freedom and property rights held by the founding fathers of the United States. The resolution serves as a warning against the implementation of socialist policies in the United States.
