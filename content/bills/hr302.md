The Energy Cybersecurity University Leadership Act of 2023 is a bill that aims to support the development of a next-generation energy-specific cybersecurity workforce. The bill directs the Secretary of Energy to provide financial assistance to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers pursuing certain courses of study related to cybersecurity and energy infrastructure. The assistance will be provided on a competitive basis in the form of scholarships, fellowships, and research and development projects at institutions of higher education. Additionally, the Secretary of Energy will conduct outreach to historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and minority-serving institutions. The bill also requires the Secretary of Energy to submit a report on the implementation of the activities described in the bill to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate within one year after the date of enactment of the bill.

#### Background

The United States is facing an increasing threat to its energy infrastructure from cyberattacks. Cybercriminals and nation-state actors are actively targeting the energy sector to disrupt operations, steal intellectual property, and gain a foothold in critical infrastructure systems. The Energy Information Administration reports that the energy sector experiences more cyber incidents than any other critical infrastructure sector.

The need for a skilled cybersecurity workforce has become more evident with the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. However, the cybersecurity workforce shortage is a persistent challenge in the United States, especially in the energy sector. The demand for cybersecurity professionals is higher than the supply, and it is expected to remain so in the foreseeable future.

#### Objectives

The Energy Cybersecurity University Leadership Act of 2023 aims to address the shortage of cybersecurity professionals in the energy sector by providing financial assistance to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers pursuing certain courses of study related to cybersecurity and energy infrastructure. The bill aims to support the development of a next-generation energy-specific cybersecurity workforce that can protect critical energy infrastructure systems from cyber threats.

The bill directs the Secretary of Energy to provide financial assistance, on a competitive basis, for scholarships, fellowships, and research and development projects at institutions of higher education to support graduate students and postdoctoral researchers pursuing a course of study that integrates cybersecurity competencies within disciplines associated with energy infrastructure needs. The bill also requires the Secretary of Energy to conduct outreach to historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and minority-serving institutions to provide greater access to opportunities to study and develop skills in the cybersecurity field.

#### Provisions

The Energy Cybersecurity University Leadership Act of 2023 has several provisions to support the development of a next-generation energy-specific cybersecurity workforce. The provisions are as follows:

Financial Assistance: The bill provides financial assistance to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers pursuing courses of study that integrate cybersecurity competencies within disciplines associated with energy infrastructure needs. The financial assistance will be provided on a competitive basis in the form of scholarships, fellowships, and research and development projects at institutions of higher education.

Research Traineeship Experiences: The bill provides graduate students and postdoctoral researchers with research traineeship experiences at National Laboratories and utilities. These experiences will help the students to gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity and energy infrastructure and provide opportunities for collaboration with industry and government professionals.

Outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions: The bill directs the Secretary of Energy to conduct outreach to these institutions to provide greater access to opportunities to study and develop skills in the cybersecurity field. This outreach will help to ensure that the development of the cybersecurity workforce is inclusive and diverse.

Reporting Requirements: The bill requires the Secretary of Energy to submit a report to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate within one year after the date of enactment of the bill. The report will provide details on the implementation of the activities described in the bill.

#### Impact

The Energy Cybersecurity University Leadership Act of 2023 has the potential to have a significant impact on the cybersecurity workforce and energy infrastructure. By providing financial assistance, research traineeship experiences, and outreach to underrepresented institutions, the bill will support the development of a next-generation energy-specific cybersecurity workforce that can protect critical energy infrastructure systems from cyber threats.

The bill's provision for financial assistance will help to attract and retain cybersecurity talent in the energy sector. The act also directs the Secretary of Energy to conduct outreach to historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and minority-serving institutions. These institutions are specifically mentioned in the act because they often have limited access to resources and may be underrepresented in the field of cybersecurity. The outreach effort will aim to increase awareness of the opportunities available through the Energy Cybersecurity University Leadership Act and encourage students at these institutions to apply for financial assistance.

The report required by the act will provide an overview of the implementation of the activities described in the act, including the number of scholarships, fellowships, and research and development projects awarded, as well as the number of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who participated in research traineeship experiences at National Laboratories and utilities. The report will also include information on the effectiveness of the outreach efforts to historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and minority-serving institutions.

the Energy Cybersecurity University Leadership Act of 2023 aims to support the development of a next-generation energy-specific cybersecurity workforce. The act provides financial assistance to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers pursuing certain courses of study relating to cybersecurity and energy infrastructure, and promotes outreach to historically underrepresented institutions. By investing in the education and training of the future cybersecurity workforce, the act seeks to ensure the security of the nation's energy infrastructure and protect against cyber threats.
