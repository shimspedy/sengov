The Alabama public has voted to elect Republican Congressman Mo Brooks to public office 14 times.  As such, Mo Brooks has successfully helped carry the GOP banner in general elections more than any other current Alabama office-holder.  The public has elected Mo Brooks five times as a state legislator, four times as a Madison County Commissioner, and six times as a U.S. Congressman.

Mo Brooks was first elected to public office as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives in 1982.  At the time, Mo Brooks was one of only 11 Republican legislators (out of 140 total) and the only elected Republican legislator north of Birmingham.

Mo Brooks was re-elected to the Alabama House in 1983, 1986, and 1990. While in the legislature, Brooks was elected Republican House Caucus Chairman three times and was ranked number one (out of 140 legislators) by the Alabama Taxpayers’ Defense Fund in the fight to protect family incomes from higher taxes. He was also ranked in the top 20 percent by Alabama Alliance of Business & Industry on pro-jobs, tort reform, and free enterprise issues and was recognized as one of the legislature’s most effective legislators by Alabama Magazine.

In 1996, Mo Brooks ran for the Madison County Commission and unseated an eight-year incumbent. He was re-elected to the Commission in 2000, 2004, and 2008.

In 2010, Mo Brooks unseated an incumbent Congressman to become the first Republican elected to Congress in Alabama’s Fifth Congressional District in more than 130 years.  Mo Brooks has been re-elected to Congress four times, every time with a reelection vote exceeding 60%.

Congressman Mo Brooks serves on two influential House committees: Armed Services and Science, Space, and Technology. Congressman Brooks also serves on three important House subcommittees: the Strategic Forces and Readiness subcommittees on Armed Services and the Space subcommittee on Science, Space, and Technology.

Now in his 6th term, Congressman Brooks’ seniority has improved to #8 out of 26 Republicans on Armed Services and #2 out of 15 Republicans on Science, Space, and Technology.

Congressman Brooks grew up in the Tennessee Valley.  Mo’s parents, Jack & Betty Brooks, taught him early on that study and hard work were expected and required. They also taught him the importance of honesty, and to never be shy about speaking up and fighting for important principles. Congressman Brooks’ father, Jack Brooks, an electrical engineer, retired from Redstone Arsenal’s Metrology Center. Brooks’ mother, Betty Brooks, taught economics and government for over 20 years at Lee High School in Huntsville. 

Congressman Brooks graduated from Grissom High School in 1972 (where he was all-city in baseball and an active member on two state championship debate teams). He graduated from Duke University in three years with a double major in political science and economics, with highest honors in economics. In 1978, he graduated from the University of Alabama Law School.

After graduation, Mo Brooks worked as a prosecutor in the Tuscaloosa District Attorney’s office, where he earned a solid "tough-on-crime" reputation.  Mo Brooks also served as Madison County’s District Attorney in 1991 and 1992.

During every year except when he served as a prosecutor, court clerk, or Congressman, the bulk of Brooks’ income came from the private sector through his private legal practice.

In 1995-1996, Mo Brooks served as a Special Assistant Attorney General for then Attorney General Jeff Sessions and, from 1996-2002, as a Special Assistant Attorney General for then Attorney General Bill Pryor.

In 1976, Congressman Brooks married Martha Jenkins of Toledo; they met at Duke University. Martha graduated from the University of Alabama with an accounting degree. She later retired as a certified public accountant and obtained a math and education major from the University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2005. She taught math at Whitesburg Middle School.

Mo and Martha are the proud parents of four children and grandparents of ten grandchildren.
