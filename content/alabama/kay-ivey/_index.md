     greeting: contact Governor Kay Ivey 
     description: Growing up in the small town of Camden in Wilcox County, Alabama, and working on her father’s farm taught Governor Kay Ivey to value hard work and living within one’s means. Her parents instilled values of faith, family, and community. After graduating from Auburn University in 1967, Governor Ivey worked as a high school teacher and a bank officer. She served as Reading Clerk of the Alabama House of Representatives under Speaker Joseph C. McCorquodale and was Assistant Director of the Alabama Development Office, where she worked to spur job creation and economic development across the state. On April 10, 2017, Governor Ivey was sworn in as the 54th Governor of the State of Alabama in the Old Senate Chamber in the Alabama State Capitol by Acting Chief Justice Lyn Stuart. Following a successful nineteen months in office, the people of Alabama made history again in November 2018 by electing Governor Ivey to a full term. She is the first Lt. Governor of Alabama elected to a full term after taking over as governor due to a vacancy in the governor’s office. On January 14, 2019, Governor Ivey was officially sworn in for her full term by Associate Justice Will Sellers.
