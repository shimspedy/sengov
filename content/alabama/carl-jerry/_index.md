#### About Jerry
Congressman Jerry Carl is a native of Mobile, Alabama, and currently represents Alabama’s First Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. Jerry was sworn in on January 3rd, 2021.

Jerry has been married to Tina, also a native of Mobile, for 39 years. Together, they have two children and two grandchildren. Jerry was raised by a single mother, so he learned the values of hard work and perseverance at an early age. This work ethic is what led him to start his first of many businesses at the age of 25.

Before his time in Congress, Jerry created and grew dozens of small businesses primarily dealing with home health care equipment and specialty pharmacies. He also has experience with timber management and real estate development. Until his son joined the Marines, Jerry never had any ambition of getting involved in politics. When his son returned from Afghanistan, Jerry decided it was time to do more for his community.

#### Advocating for Economic Development, Job Growth, and Lower Taxes

Jerry served two terms on the Mobile County Commission before running for Congress. During his time in public office, Jerry has fought to restore common sense to government, and he has been a consistent fighter for job creation, lower taxes, and family values. Jerry is a staunch defender of our fundamental constitutional rights, and he is committed to limiting the size and scope of the federal government by eliminating wasteful spending and doing away with burdensome rules and regulations.

#### Advancing our National Security Interests

Alabama’s contribution to our nation’s military strength and defense programs is vital to national security. Jerry is a natural fit on the House Armed Services Committee, where he is a staunch advocate for the defense interests of Alabama and the United States as a whole. Whether it’s Austal Shipyard in Mobile, Fort Rucker in the Wiregrass, Maxwell-Gunter Airforce Base in Montgomery, or Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama’s contribution to our nation’s military strength and defense programs is critical to national security.

#### Protecting and Promoting Alabama’s Natural Resources

Jerry also serves on the House Committee on Natural Resources, where he works to promote offshore energy production, protect and expand land for recreational hunting and fishing, advocate for Alabama’s timberland, manage and sustain our oceans and fisheries, and oversee tribal lands.
