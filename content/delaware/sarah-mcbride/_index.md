Congresswoman Sarah McBride proudly represents the greatest state in the nation, and our country’s First State, Delaware, as its sole member of Congress.

Sarah grew up in Wilmington and has been serving our state for decades as a public servant and advocate. From 2020-2025, Congresswoman McBride served as State Senator for the First State Senate District. She worked for former Governor Jack Markell and the late Attorney General Beau Biden, and served as the national spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ equal rights organization.

As a state senator, McBride passed legislation expanding access to health care, requiring mental health and media literacy education in public schools, promoting green technologies, and protecting workers and families.

In her first term as state senator, McBride passed the landmark Healthy Delaware Families Act, providing paid family and medical leave to workers throughout the First State and marking the largest expansion of Delaware's social safety net in decades. In her final term, she passed the largest ongoing investment into Delaware’s Medicaid program since the Affordable Care Act. Passing the legislation with unanimous and bipartisan support, the Protect Medicaid Act of 2024 unlocks over $175 million annually in new discretionary Medicaid funding to protect, enhance, and expand health coverage for the roughly 200,000 Delawareans who receive care through the joint state- and federal-funded health insurance program.

Prior to her service in the State Senate, McBride led the successful effort to pass a landmark non-discrimination law in Delaware. For her work and advocacy, former Gov. Markell awarded McBride the Order of the First State, making her one of the youngest Delawareans granted the state’s highest civilian honor.

Sarah married her late husband Andrew Cray in 2014 and is the proud aunt of seven. She is a graduate of Cab Calloway School of the Arts and American University. McBride has taught public policy at the University of Delaware and is the author of the 2018 memoir, “Tomorrow Will Be Different,” which includes a foreword from President Joe Biden.
