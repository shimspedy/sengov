     greeting: contact Governor Janet Mills 
     description: Governor Mills was sworn in as the 75th Governor of Maine on Wednesday, January 2, 2019. Governor Mills was born and raised in Farmington, Maine, where she still proudly lives today. She graduated from Mt. Blue High School in Farmington, the University of Massachusetts at Boston, and the University of Maine School of Law. Governor Mills first entered public service as an Assistant Attorney General, where she prosecuted homicides and other major crimes. After a few years, she was elected District Attorney for Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford Counties, making her the first woman to be elected as a DA in New England. Prior to becoming governor, Governor Mills served as the Attorney General of Maine â€“ the first and only woman to hold the job. Governor Mills is the first woman governor of Maine. In her historic victory, she earned more votes than any governor in state history and is first governor since 1966 to win a majority of the vote for her first term. In 1985, she met and married the love of her life, her husband, Stan Kuklinski, a widower with five young daughters ages four to sixteen. Governor Mills and Stan moved back to Farmington, and she became a full-time mom to five daughters who she helped raise while working full-time herself. She is now the proud grandmother to three grandsons and two granddaughters.
