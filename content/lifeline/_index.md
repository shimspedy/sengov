## What Is the Lifeline Assistance Program?

Lifeline is a federally sponsored program aimed at ensuring that all Americans have access to essential telephone and internet services. Established in 1985 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the program has evolved over the years. Initially, it provided subsidies for home phones, but now it covers mobile phone and data services, broadband (high-speed) internet, and bundled voice and internet services.

The program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), an independent not-for-profit organization based in Washington, D.C. Lifeline-subsidized services are delivered through various regional carriers across the country.

## How Does the Lifeline Program Help Seniors?

Phone services are crucial for everyone, especially seniors who may not be as familiar with internet-based communication platforms like social media and video conferencing. A phone is a lifeline to emergency services, medical assistance, friends, family, and essential government programs. With the decline of public pay phones and the growing reliance on mobile phones, having a cell phone is increasingly important for maintaining independence and safety.

Modern smartphones offer features like GPS navigation, voice-activated calling, and emergency services that can help older adults stay safe. Additionally, there are thousands of apps designed to promote health and wellness for seniors, such as medication reminders and activity trackers.

The Lifeline Assistance Program helps to eliminate financial barriers, enabling low- and moderate-income seniors to access home phones, mobile phones, and internet services.

## What Does the Lifeline Program Cover?

The Lifeline program provides eligible low-income households with discounts on home and mobile phone services, as well as broadband and bundled voice-internet services. 

### Eligible Lifeline Services:
- Home phone service
- Mobile phone service (with or without data)
- Broadband home internet service
- Broadband-voice service bundles

Lifeline subsidies are granted on a per-household basis, with one subsidy per household. Most states have multiple authorized Lifeline providers, allowing beneficiaries to choose the best plan for their needs. Many carriers offer special plans that match the monthly Lifeline subsidy, making phone service free for participants.

### Monthly Lifeline Assistance Program Subsidy Limits:

Beneficiaries receive a monthly subsidy of up to $9.25 off the cost of home or mobile phone, internet, and bundled services. Residents of Tribal lands qualify for an additional $25, for a maximum subsidy of $34.25. They may also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 for connection or activation charges.

## Who Qualifies for the Lifeline Assistance Program?

The Lifeline program is designed for low- and moderate-income households. Applicants must have an annual household income at or below 135% of the federal poverty guidelines or participate in specific government assistance programs, such as:
- Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
- Medicaid
- Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit
- Federal Public Housing Assistance
- Supplemental Security Income (SSI)

Residents of Tribal lands may also qualify if they receive benefits from programs like the Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance or Tribal TANF.

### Whatâ€™s Considered a Household Under Lifeline Guidelines?

A household is defined as a single individual who lives independently or multiple people who live together and share income and expenses. Congregate living settings, such as retirement homes, are often considered single-person households under Lifeline guidelines.

## Does the Lifeline Program Offer Free Phones?

While Lifeline funds are for telecommunications services, some carriers offer free mobile phones to participants who sign up for a plan. These phones typically include smartphones with features like GPS and mobile data, though they are often from lesser-known manufacturers. Participants can also opt to use their own compatible phone with a Lifeline carrier.

## How to Apply for the Lifeline Assistance Program

Most applicants can apply through the National Verifier Application System operated by USAC, which streamlines the eligibility confirmation process. Residents of California, Texas, and Oregon must apply through their state's specific Lifeline programs.

## Annual Lifeline Recertification

Lifeline benefits are valid for one year. Beneficiaries must recertify annually to continue receiving the subsidy. The recertification process verifies that participants are still eligible and can be completed online, by phone, or by mail.

## Lifeline Program Rules

Participants must agree to the following:
- Complete annual recertification within 60 days of receiving the notification.
- Keep contact information up-to-date.
- Only use one Lifeline subsidy per household.
- Use their Lifeline service at least once every 30 days to avoid disconnection.
