     greeting: contact Governor Laura Kelly 
     description: Laura Kelly was sworn in as the 48th governor of the State of Kansas on January 14, 2019. Governor Kelly grew up in a career military family where she learned the importance of service, integrity and accountability. She has made it her lifeâ€™s work to fight for children and families on the job, in her community, and as a four-term state senator. As the long-time leader of the Kansas Recreation and Park Association, Laura advocated for public parks across the state. Governor Kelly was elected to the Kansas Senate in 2004. She immediately built a reputation as a no-nonsense leader who could work with anyone to get things done. After just two years, she was asked to serve as the Ranking Minority member of the important Ways and Means Committee. She has advocated for fiscally responsible, balanced budgets that still reflect the priorities of Kansas communities, like schools, health care, roads and public safety. Laura and her husband Ted Daughety, a doctor of pulmonary and sleep disorders, live in Topeka and have been married for 36 years. They have two grown daughters, Kathleen and Molly Daughety.
