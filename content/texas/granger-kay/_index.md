A native Texan and member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, Granger is an alumna of Texas Wesleyan University. After graduation, she was a classroom teacher for nine years before building a successful insurance business, which she managed for more than two decades. In recognition of her service as an educator, business owner and public servant, her alma mater honored her with an honorary doctorate of humane letters. 

Kay’s rise to prominence in the U.S. House of Representatives is marked by a distinguished business career; a lifelong commitment to public service, which includes serving as the first female mayor of Fort Worth, Texas; and in her current role as Congresswoman for one of Texas’ most influential congressional districts.   

Granger currently serves as the Ranking Member of the powerful Appropriations Committee. In this role, Kay has been a leading voice for Texas, advocating for government accountability and transparency.

During her tenure in the House of Representatives, Granger has been a forceful and unrelenting advocate for global security and national defense. Kay established herself as one of the nation’s leading proponents of its Armed Forces. In fact, Granger has received numerous honors for her leadership on national defense issues including the 2016 Henry M. Scoop Jackson Distinguished Service Award presented by the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs for her unwavering commitment throughout her career for a robust military capability for the U.S. and its allies.

Granger was also awarded the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award and the Department of the Army’s Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service. These honors are the top recognitions given to civilians by the secretary of the Navy and secretary of the Army.

Texas’ 12th Congressional District is a strategic center for our nation’s defense, and is home to the Naval Air Station Fort Worth – Joint Reserve Base (NAS Fort Worth-JRB), a key facility for the U.S. Armed Forces. It also serves as home for many important defense contractors and subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, where the F-35 “Lightning” Joint Strike Fighter aircraft is built, among other programs including the US Air Force workhorse, F-16 “Fighting Falcon,” and the world’s premier fighter aircraft, the F-22 “Raptor.”

As a result of Granger’s leadership and unwavering support, the 12th District has played an integral role in the current “War on Terror,” and provided vital jobs to constituents, while also fueling both the Texas and U.S. economies.

She has also been a champion for growth at the world’s first industrial airport, Fort Worth Alliance Airport, and its surrounding Alliance Texas development, which today is home to more than 400 of the world’s leading companies and the Federal Aviation Administration’s Southwest Headquarters.

In recognition of her accomplishments in Congress, as former mayor of the City of Fort Worth and as a business owner, Granger has been elected to the Texas Women’s Hall of Fame and the Fort Worth Business Hall of Fame.

Kay attends the First United Methodist Church of Fort Worth and is the mother of three children and grandmother of five. She is an avid and accomplished painter and enjoys spending free time with her family.

#### ATIONAL SECURITY
Kay believes ensuring our troops have the best equipment and training is a necessity for our success against our adversaries. Kay fights to ensure necessary funding goes to support our brave service members who protect our nation’s freedom. 

Despite growing threats we face around the world, including those from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda, President Biden continues to propose cutting our national defense. 

Now, more than ever, strong investments in our national security are essential to deterring any and all potential adversaries. Kay will never stop fighting for those who fight for us, no matter where the threat exists.

#### TAXES
Kay is working hard to reduce the size of government and lower taxes. In 2017, Kay worked with President Trump and passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that lowered tax rates for all Americans, led to the lowest poverty rate in a half century, and brought unemployment down to its lowest in 50 years.

Kay continues to fight against Democrats crippling tax increases on workers and small businesses. She supports a constitutional amendment that would require the House of Representatives to have a 3/5 majority to raise taxes, preventing the Democrats massive tax increases.

#### BUDGET
Kay believes Congress must do more to control spending. Kay has prioritized and eliminated wasteful or duplicative programs, and we need to use the same fiscal discipline that American families exercise at home. Kay supports an amendment to the Constitution requiring the federal government to balance the budget. Such an amendment would go a long way in bringing fiscal restraint to Washington.

#### EDUCATION
As a parent, former school teacher, and the daughter of an educator, Kay has seen firsthand the triumphs that can happen in the classroom, but also the challenges our students, teachers, and school administrators face in today’s education system. Parents, not federal bureaucrats, should be the chief decision makers when it comes to their children’s education. Kay is committed to having safe schools and ensuring teachers have the resources they need to make sure our children are prepared to be the leaders, innovators, and job creators of tomorrow.

#### ISRAEL & THE MIDDLE EAST
Kay has a long record of supporting Israel. For decades, the United States and Israel have forged a bond based on the pursuit of peace in the Middle East, Israeli security, and our shared goals of fighting terrorism. Earlier in 2021, Israel was under attack from terrorists. Countless civilian lives were saved because of the Iron Dome system that the United States has supported year-after-year.  

Kay has led the fight to replenish the Iron Dome funding, while Democrats have stripped it out of funding bills multiple times. Kay believes our friendship and mutual support for Israel are unshakeable, and believes it is critical for us to strengthen this relationship.

#### BORDER SECURITY & IMMIGRATION
Kay believes in a strong border and supports finishing President Trump’s border wall. 

No form of immigration reform should be passed without border security and enforcement of our current immigration laws. 

We must act to stop drugs and criminals from coming across our borders. Kay opposes any form of amnesty. Kay does not believe that the immigrants who have come here illegally should be given any special privileges. They should not be allowed to get on a path to citizenship ahead of the thousands of people who have been waiting in line for months, if not years.

#### OUR VETERANS
Our military veterans face many challenges when they leave the military. Kay supports the men and women who have dedicated, and are still currently dedicating, their lives to safeguarding this nation and preserving democracy. Kay has helped our veterans obtain the services and benefits they rightfully deserve.
