It is the honor of my lifetime to represent Texas’ 26th Congressional District. I was born on a military air force base in New Mexico and grew up on a cattle ranch in West Texas.

I attended Dartmouth College and graduated cum laude with degrees in both Economics and History. I was President of the conservative paper, The Dartmouth Review. I was also President of Christian Union and grew it to be one of the largest student groups on campus, despite being on a campus hostile to the Christian faith. In college, I fought the left nonstop - on their own turf - and I left Dartmouth even more conservative than when I arrived.

Upon graduation, I became an investment banker on Wall Street and then worked as an analyst at a global, multi-strategy hedge fund. For many people, I was living the American Dream. I was working in one of the largest, most successful hedge funds in the world, and rising fast in the industry.

Yet, the call for service and duty to my country came. I could not sit back as progressive politicians and their cheerleaders in the media worked hard to destroy all the things that make our country great. Biden and his Leftist allies have spent years inflicting disastrous economic policies on millions of working-class Americans, in communities like the one I grew up in. 

That’s why I left a successful career in finance. I soon launched DC Enquirer, a conservative, America First news outlet, which exploded in popularity almost overnight.

I am happily married to my wife, Danielle. She has written two books, one about Christianity, and the other is a pro-life book that debunks the Left’s pro-abortion arguments. She served on the Advisory Board of Women for Trump and led the Texas Women for Trump bus tour. She has spoken at churches in Texas, at Turning Point USA conferences, and at rallies before the Supreme Court to confirm Amy Coney Barrett. She is an amazing mother who continues to fight for the littlest among us. 

I am also a father to our beautiful daughter, Marigold. I ran for Congress so she and all our children can live in a better America, and I look forward to serving in the 119th Congress to accomplish our shared Republican agenda.
