##### DEDICATED MOM. WOMAN OF FAITH. BORDER PATROL WIFE. INDEPENDENT LEGISLATOR. SOUTH TEXAS CONGRESSWOMAN.

Mayra Nohemi Flores (born January 1, 1986) is an American politician who represented Texas's 34th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2022 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, she was the first Mexican-born woman elected to the House.

Flores was born and raised in Burgos, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Her family moved to the United States when she was six years old, and she gained citizenship at age 14. Growing up, she worked alongside her parents in the Texas cotton fields to earn money for school clothes and supplies. She graduated from San Benito High School and South Texas College.

Before her congressional campaign, she worked as a respiratory therapist and chaired Hispanic outreach for the Hidalgo County Republican Party. In June 2022, she won a special election for Texas's 34th congressional district after Democratic Representative Filemon Vela Jr. resigned. She proudly served the district on the Homeland Security and Agriculture Committees following her historic victory.

Flores lost her campaign for a full term in the November 2022 midterm elections to Democrat Vicente Gonzalez after the district was redrawn.

With strong conservative values instilled by her parents and grandparents, Flores always prioritized God and family. She graduated in 2014 as a Respiratory Care Practitioner and dedicated herself to caring for the elderly and disabled with chronic respiratory issues, playing a crucial role in combating COVID-19. She is a proud U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) wife and a mother, committed to fighting for a better future for the children of South Texas.

## SECURING THE BORDER

Illegal immigration fuels human and child trafficking. As someone who legally immigrated to America at six years old and lives in South Texas, I have a unique perspective on illegal immigration and its impact on American citizens' livelihoods. We MUST secure our border to keep harmful individuals out and to encourage LEGAL immigration.

## MORE JOBS, BETTER OPPORTUNITIES

We need to create opportunities for everyone to achieve the American Dream and find prosperity. Through smart, pro-growth policies, we can foster an environment where small businesses can thrive and create jobs in South Texas.

For too long, radicals from both sides have inserted politics into business operations, and that needs to end. Job creators should feel empowered, not burdened by excessive taxes and regulations.

## EDUCATION, NOT INDOCTRINATION

Our children's education is the foundation of their future success. However, many kids today are not receiving the education they deserve. Radical gender ideology has infiltrated classrooms, and disturbing content is present even in elementary schools. America needs to refocus on teaching essential knowledge, not imposing far-left worldviews.

Parents should always have the right to know what their children are being taught. Their voices must be heard in curriculum decisions. Families should have the freedom to choose the best education for their children. School choice is a human right, and outdated one-size-fits-all systems have trapped too many children in failing schools.

We also need to support our public school teachers better. Many care deeply about our children but lack the resources and support to teach effectively. This must change.

## ENERGY JOBS & INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE

Texas and the United States have the energy resources to lower home energy prices, gas prices, and secure our national interests. In Congress, I proudly supported legislation that empowered energy producers and reduced burdensome regulations.

American energy is the backbone of a strong, resilient economy. I will continue to fight for every reliable energy source in Congress. The Left's assault on the energy industry affects many Texans and their families. I will protect their jobs and way of life so they can achieve the American Dream.

## PROTECTING WOMEN'S SPORTS

Title IX, enacted nearly fifty years ago, enshrined fairness in sports and American life. Now, this essential right is being eroded by biological males competing in women's competitions. We need to stop this practice and protect women's rights to compete and achieve. I fully support barring males from competing in women's sports and invading women's private spaces.

## EMPOWERING PARENTS

As a mom, I can't imagine my child's school or the government telling me how to raise my children. Yet, many American families face this situation daily. It's time to put parents back in the driver's seat and protect kids from those who wish to impose their views on our families.

### ENACT THE PARENTS BILL OF RIGHTS

In March 2023, the Republican-led House of Representatives passed the Parents Bill of Rights, protecting parents' rights to be involved in their children's lives and decision-making. Vicente Gonzalez voted NO, siding with a radical agenda that takes kids away from their parents and denies moms and dads the right to make critical decisions.

### PROTECTING PARENTAL CUSTODY

Across the nation, stories emerge of children being taken from their parents due to radical gender ideology. A child should not be taken away from their parents. Vicente Gonzalez's silence on this issue aligns him with those tearing families apart to advance a far-left agenda.

## PROTECTING KIDS

The United States remains the number one consumer of child pornography and child sex trafficking. We must protect kids from these sick individuals.

With the Vicente Gonzalez and Joe Biden "OPEN BORDER" policies, kids are trafficked over the border by cartels and forced into sex trafficking. We must hold the cartels, Mexican government, and Americans who enable these actions accountable. I will tirelessly advocate for securing the border, stopping sex trafficking, and protecting kids from dangerous situations. Enough is enoughâ€”it's time to stand up for what's right!

## PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY

Washington politicians often use seniors' money to cover their mistakes. I will always protect Social Security and Medicare, never jeopardizing the future of our older Americans. Seniors deserve a voice at the table that won't sell them out to plug a financial hole or push a dangerous agenda. I am here to protect them and the programs they have paid into their entire lives.
