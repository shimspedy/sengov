Congressman Morgan Luttrell is currently serving his first term representing Texas' 8th Congressional District. Texas’ 8th District encompasses parts of Montgomery, Walker, Harris, and all of San Jacinto and Polk counties. He serves on three Committees in Congress: House Armed Services Committee, Committee on Homeland Security, and Committee on Veterans' Affairs

As a 5th generation Texan raised on a horse ranch, Morgan learned the importance of hard work, discipline, and personal responsibility at an early age. He turned his strong values, deep love for America, and passion for helping others into a career of distinguished service. 

After graduating from Willis High School, Morgan earned his bachelors in Psychology from Sam Houston State University. Shortly after graduation, he enlisted in the US Navy. 

In 2009, by the grace of God, Morgan survived a deadly helicopter crash that left him with a broken back and a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Determined to get back in the fight with his teammates, Morgan rehabbed, recovered, and returned to the frontline. 

Following an honorable 14-year military career, Morgan retired from the Navy in 2014 and applied his personal success and experience to help fellow veterans recover from PTSD and traumatic brain injuries sustained in battle. After achieving an advanced degree in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience at the University of Texas at Dallas, Morgan created an innovative health and wellness platform helping veterans heal from their physical and psychological injuries.

Former Texas Governor and Energy Secretary Rick Perry appointed Morgan to serve as a Special Advisor at the Department of Energy—leading the creation of the Artificial Intelligence and Technologies Office to ensure America continued to outpace Russia and China in the development of machine-learning technology.

Morgan applied his expertise to harness and combine the nation’s most powerful computing resources with next-generation AI analytic tools to help solve some of America’s most formidable healthcare challenges like cancer, traumatic brain injuries, suicide, and opioid addiction. 

In addition to representing Texas’ 8th District in Congress, Morgan is a small business owner, husband and father.

#### MEET MORGAN
Morgan Luttrell built a life centered around service. A 5th generation Texan raised on a horse ranch, at an early age Morgan learned the importance of hard work, discipline, and personal responsibility. He turned his strong values, deep love for America, and passion for helping others into a career of distinguished service. 

After graduating from Willis High School, Morgan earned his bachelors in Psychology from Sam Houston State University—but he found his calling when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy to become a Navy SEAL. 

From Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL training (BUD/S) to Officer Candidate School, Morgan excelled as top grad—no matter the challenge. He served multiple combat deployments and led his troops as a Naval Special Warfare Officer.

In 2009, by the grace of God, Morgan survived a deadly helicopter crash that left him with a broken back and a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Determined to get back in the fight with his teammates, Morgan rehabbed, recovered, and returned to the frontline. 

Following an honorable 14-year military career, Morgan retired from the Navy in 2014 and applied his personal success and experience to help fellow veterans recover from PTSD and traumatic brain injuries sustained in battle. After achieving an advanced degree in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience at the University of Texas at Dallas, Morgan created an innovative health and wellness platform helping veterans heal from their physical and psychological injuries.

Morgan’s work with the Boot Campaign, a Texas based non-profit, caught the attention of former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who had recently been appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the Department of Energy (DOE). 

Secretary Perry appointed Morgan to serve as a Special Advisor at the DOE—leading the creation of the Artificial Intelligence and Technologies Office to ensure America continued to outpace Russia and China in the development of machine-learning technology.

Morgan applied his expertise to harness and combine the nation’s most powerful computing resources with next-generation AI analytic tools to help solve some of America’s most formidable healthcare challenges like cancer, traumatic brain injuries, suicide, and opioid addiction. 

Today, after earning his executive certificate in professional leadership development from the Harvard Business School, Morgan serves as an adjunct professor at Sam Houston State University. He teaches law enforcement leadership, runs a successful small business, and is raising his family in Montgomery County.

Across two wars, healing fellow veterans, and leading 21st century technological advances in President Trump's Department of Energy, Morgan has poured every ounce of himself into protecting America and saving as many lives as he can. He’s ready for his next mission: serving as our conservative Congressman.

Under the Biden and Pelosi regime, Morgan knows our freedoms are under the constant threat of the socialist agenda. The radical left is waging a culture war on Texans very way of life. Like you, Morgan will not allow the conservative values we’re teaching our children to be threatened by DC. As our Congressman, Morgan will bring bold leadership, put America first, fight to finish the Wall, stop radical indoctrination in our kids’ classrooms, defend from increasing cybersecurity threats, stand with Israel, and protect America from the threat of Russia and China and socialists here at home. 

Morgan and his wife Leslie reside in Magnolia with their two sons, Gunner and Lincoln.
