Congressman Sylvester Turner was elected to represent the historic 18th Congressional District of Texas, a seat long held by transformative leaders such as Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, Congressman Mickey Leland, Congressman Craig Washington, and the late, great Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (followed by her daughter Congresswoman Erica Lee Carter). Turner proudly continues this legacy of leadership, advancing the district’s tradition of justice, equity, and transformative public service with his unique vision and experience.

Born and raised in Houston’s Acres Homes neighborhood, Turner earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of Houston and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School. He began his distinguished legal career as a trial lawyer at Fulbright & Jaworski, where his success and dedication led him to co-found Barnes & Turner, a prominent law firm specializing in commercial law and personal injury litigation.

Turner served 27 years in the Texas House of Representatives, representing District 139. As a respected bipartisan leader, he served 21 years on the House Appropriations Committee and six years as Speaker Pro Tem, helping shape state fiscal policy and balancing multiple budgets.

Elected as Houston’s 62nd Mayor in 2015 and re-elected in 2019, Turner led the nation’s fourth-largest city through unprecedented challenges. He guided Houston through seven federally declared natural disasters, including Hurricane Harvey, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Turner championed pension reform, reducing the city’s liabilities by billions, a "fix" that eluded the city for nearly two decades.

Turner launched Houston’s first Climate Action Plan, reinforcing the city’s status as the energy capital of the world and committing to carbon neutrality by 2050. He chaired the Global Resilient Cities Network, was a leader in the C40 Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, and served as Chair of U.S. Climate Mayors, enhancing Houston's leadership in sustainability, climate adaptation, and energy transition.

In addition to environmental leadership, Turner’s administration prioritized public safety through the One Safe Houston initiative, which addressed violent crime and mental health. He also tackled illegal dumping through the One Clean Houston campaign, resulting in cleaner and safer neighborhoods. Turner’s Complete Communities initiative focused on revitalizing underserved areas by leveraging public and private partnerships to create equitable growth and opportunity. His Hire Houston Youth program provided over 20,000 jobs to young adults, improving economic mobility for the next generation.

Nationally, Turner served as Chair of the African American Mayors Association and as a Trustee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, further cementing his role as a national leader.

Turner is a proud father of one daughter and grandfather of one grandson. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated, The Church Without Walls, and resides in his home community of Acres Homes in Houston, Texas.
