Juan Alanis began a career in public service on his 21st birthday when he proudly pinned on a badge as a law enforcement officer. For nearly three decades, he has dedicated his life to protecting others. Juan has received three awards for saving the lives of others, including a decoration for rescuing a child whose father was trying to burn down a house with his daughter inside it. 

The newly created 22nd Assembly District is more than just borders on a map; for Juan, it is home. It is where he married his wife, Barbara. It is where they raised their three children. It’s where he has worked as a peace officer, protecting and serving in nearly every community in Stanislaus County over the course of his career. 

In the legislature, Juan hopes to bring his Public Safety expertise to Sacramento, providing a voice of reason & common sense to the capitol. In addition to helping shape policy that makes Californians safer, Juan will fight to reduce the cost of living for working-class families, protect the Central Valley’s water rights, and be a true champion for the 22nd District’s Agricultural & Business communities.
