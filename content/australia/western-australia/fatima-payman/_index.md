Fatima Payman The First Hijab-Wearing Muslim Woman in the Australian Parliament"

Fatima Payman is an Afghan-born Australian politician who made history in 2022 by becoming the first hijab-wearing Muslim woman to be elected to the Australian Parliament. Born in Kabul in 1995, Fatima fled the Taliban with her family when she was just five years old, seeking refuge in Pakistan. Her father eventually made it to Australia in 1999, where he spent time in immigration detention before working as a security guard, kitchen hand, and taxi driver to bring the rest of his family to Australia in 2003.

Growing up in Perth, Fatima attended the Australian Islamic College where she was head girl before studying pharmacy at university. However, her experiences with the exploitation her father faced in various jobs prompted her to get involved in politics. She joined the United Workers Union in 2018 and became president of Young Labor WA, dedicating herself to advocating for workers' rights.

In 2022, Fatima entered politics as the third candidate on the Labor Party's ticket for the Senate, intending to use the election as practice before running seriously in 2025. However, she defied expectations by winning the sixth and final Senate vacancy in Western Australia, becoming the third-youngest Senator in Australian history at the age of 27.

As a Senator, Fatima has made it her mission to get more people from diverse backgrounds involved in politics, improve early childhood education, and tackle climate change. She has also expressed a desire to "normalise hijab wearing," using her platform to show that Muslim women can succeed in politics and other fields while still maintaining their religious identity.

Despite facing obstacles such as the difficulty of renouncing her Afghan citizenship due to the Taliban's takeover of the country, Fatima has shown a determination and resilience that is an inspiration to many. With her historic election, she has broken down barriers and opened doors for others to follow in her footsteps.
