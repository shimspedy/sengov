Nola Marino is an Australian politician who has been a member of the House of Representatives since 2007, representing the Division of Forrest in Western Australia. She is a member of the Liberal Party and has held various positions in the party, including Chief Government Whip and Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories.

Before entering politics, Marino ran a dairy farm with her husband and served on the board of Dairy Western Australia, an industry lobby group. She also served as president of the Harvey Bulls Football Club for ten years. Marino is the first woman to represent the Division of Forrest, which was established in 1922.

Marino reportedly supported Malcolm Turnbull in the 2015 leadership spill against Tony Abbott, and Turnbull subsequently appointed her as Chief Government Whip in the House of Representatives. She was the first woman to hold the office. In 2019, Marino was appointed Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories in the Morrison government. She held the position until May 2022, following the appointment of the Albanese ministry. Marino is a member of the centre-right faction of the Liberal Party.
