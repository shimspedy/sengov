William Edward Slade Brockman is an Australian politician and current President of the Australian Senate. He was born on 27 March 1970 in Manjimup, Western Australia, and grew up on a family farm in the South West region of the state.

Brockman received his Bachelor of Laws from the University of New England and a first-class Honours Degree in Political History from Murdoch University. Prior to his career in politics, he ran his family farm and held management roles in business, as well as working for industry associations.

Brockman was appointed as a Senator for Western Australia in 2017, filling the casual vacancy resulting from the resignation of Chris Back. He is a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party and has served in various parliamentary and committee roles, including as Government Deputy Whip of the Senate, Chair of the Economics Legislation Committee, and Chair of the Select Committee on Multi-Jurisdictional Management and Execution of the Murray Darling Basin Plan.

Brockman's policy interests include agriculture, mining, trade, oil and gas, infrastructure, and regional development. He has expressed his personal beliefs against the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill, and voted against it in parliament.

Following the resignation of Scott Ryan, Brockman was chosen as the Liberal Party's candidate for President of the Senate in 2021. He won the position with 45 votes against Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi's 7 votes.
