Matt, the Liberal Senator for Western Australia, is committed to listening and learning from the community he represents, in order to deliver measurable social and economic outcomes that benefit Western Australians. Born in 1978 and based in Perth, Matt currently holds the position of Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate and serves on five committees: the Senate Standing Committee of Selection of Bills, the Senate Standing Committee of Senatorsâ€™ Interests, the Deputy Chair of Senate Legislative Committee on Education and Employment, the Chair of Senate References Committee on Education and Employment, and the Joint Statutory Committee of Human Rights.

Matt's family has been in Western Australia for six generations. His great-grandparents, Michael and Kathleen Kilrain, were among the first settlers in Manjimup, and their farm is still owned by the family today. Matt's other great-grandparents, Mick and Sarah O'Sullivan, worked and raised their children in Manjimup as well. These values of hard work, personal responsibility, working with and giving back to the community, and family have guided Matt's life and career.

Matt and his wife Montanique are raising their two children in Perth's southern suburbs. His career has taken him all over Western Australia, starting as a tradesman and later working as a youth worker for eight years. In 2008, Matt joined Andrew and Nicola Forrest's Minderoo Foundation, where he led the nation-building project, GenerationOne, which has helped tens of thousands of Indigenous people find work.

Matt was sworn in as a Senator for Western Australia on July 2, 2019. As a member of the Australian Parliament, he serves on several committees, including the Senate Legislation Committee for Finance and Public Administration, the Legislation and References Committee for Education and Employment, and the Senators' Interests Standing Committee. Matt believes that strong families, good government policy, and meaningful employment are critical to building successful communities, and he is committed to putting these convictions into practice as a Senator for Western Australia.
