Claire Chandler is an Australian politician who currently serves as a Senator for Tasmania, representing the Liberal Party. She was born on June 1, 1990, and grew up in the Huon Valley. Chandler attended St Michael's Collegiate, a Hobart private school for girls, before pursuing her education at the University of Tasmania, where she studied Arts/Law.

During her time at university, Chandler developed an interest in politics, and joined the University of Tasmania Liberal Club. It was here that she met her future husband, Chris Edwards. Chandler later became a member of the Young Liberals and served as both the Tasmanian Division President and Federal President.

As Young Liberal President, Chandler led an internal review of the Tasmanian Division of the Liberal Party gender imbalance. She described the party's engagement with women as "sobering" following the report, but rejected the idea of gender quotas as a solution to fix the divide.

Chandler stood as a candidate for the seat of Franklin at the 2018 Tasmanian state election, before being preselected in the second position on the Liberal Party's Senate ticket in Tasmania on September 9, 2018. She was subsequently elected to the Senate at the 2019 federal election, becoming Australia's youngest female senator at the age of 29.

Chandler is a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party and has been described as a conservative. She advocates for a conscience vote for members of parliament on euthanasia, but does not support any changes to the law as it currently stands in Tasmania. Chandler campaigns against the use of anti-discrimination laws and tax-payer funds to suppress free speech by those she calls "the woke".

Chandler is a strong advocate for women's "sex-based rights" and is against the expansion of transgender rights. She argues that women's sports, toilets, and change rooms should be reserved for people of the female sex. In June 2021, Chandler appeared at an online event alongside Walt Heyer, an American de-transitioned activist who has called gender reassignment surgery a "modern-day frontal lobotomy". Chandler has also criticised the attendance of transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard at the 2020 Summer Olympics, arguing that it displaced other female athletes.

In February 2022, Chandler introduced the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment (Save Women's Sport) Bill 2022 to the Parliament of Australia, further cementing her stance on the issue.
