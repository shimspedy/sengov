Carol Louise Brown is an Australian politician and member of the Australian Labor Party. Born on 19 July 1963 in Hobart, Tasmania, she is the eighth of thirteen children of union and Labor activists Julia and Rex Brown. Her great-grandmother, Mary Butler, was a founding member of the Hobart branch of the ALP, while her uncle Leo Brown served as state president of the party. Brown joined the ALP at a young age and worked as an administrative officer with the party from 1984 to 1996.

Brown's political career began when she became an adviser to Senator Sue Mackay in 1996. She later held various positions with the Tasmanian state government, including portfolio services manager within the Department of Premier and Cabinet (1998–2002), office manager for the Minister for Primary Industries, Water and Environment (2002–2004), and office manager for the Minister for Infrastructure, Energy and Resources (2004–2005). Brown also served as an assistant secretary of the Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch) and acted as state secretary in 2000.

On 25 August 2005, Brown was appointed to the Australian Senate to fill a casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Sue Mackay. She was subsequently elected in her own right in the federal elections of 2007, 2013, 2016, and 2019, representing the state of Tasmania. Brown is a member of the ALP's left faction.

After the 2010 election, Brown was elected Deputy Government Whip, and after the 2013 election, she was added to Bill Shorten's shadow ministry as a shadow parliamentary secretary. In 2016, she was promoted to Shadow Minister for Disability and Carers, but in 2019, she was returned to the rank of shadow assistant minister.

In the 2022 Federal election, Labor won government, and Brown was appointed Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Transport in the Albanese government. Throughout her political career, Brown has been a strong advocate for issues such as climate change action, workers' rights, and the rights of people with disabilities and their carers.
