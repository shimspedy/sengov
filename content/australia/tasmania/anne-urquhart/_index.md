Anne Elizabeth Urquhart is an accomplished Australian politician who currently serves as a Senator for Tasmania since 2011, representing the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Born on 18 October 1957 in Latrobe, Tasmania, Anne was the second of three children of Tom and Betty Polden. She began working as a process worker at the Edgell-Birds Eye factory in Ulverstone in July 1980 after starting a family with her husband Graham.

Anne Urquhart has a strong background in union organizing, having joined the Food Preservers' Union of Australia and serving as a delegate before becoming a full-time organizer in August 1990. Her union later merged into the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU), where she continued to serve as state president from 1998 to 2004 and state secretary from 2004 to 2010.

In addition to her union activities, Urquhart has also been an active member of the Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch) since 2004, serving as vice-president and delegate to the ALP National Conference. She was elected to the Senate at the 2010 federal election and was re-elected for a second term in 2016.

During her time in the Senate, Anne Urquhart has been a member of several committees, including the Senate Select Committee on the Future of Public Interest Journalism and the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. She has also held several positions within the ALP, including chief whip in the Senate since 2016 and state president of the ALP in Tasmania since 2014, replacing Rebecca White.

Following the ALP's victory at the 2022 federal election, Anne Urquhart was appointed as chief government whip, which highlights her rising importance and political acumen within the party. Despite her busy schedule, Anne Urquhart still maintains an office in Devonport, where she remains committed to serving the people of Tasmania with passion and dedication.
