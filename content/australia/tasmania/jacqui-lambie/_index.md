Jacqui Lambie is a former Australian politician and member of the Australian Senate. She was born on February 26, 1971, in Tasmania, Australia. Lambie started her career as a soldier in the Australian Army before entering politics.

Throughout her political career, Lambie made headlines for her controversial statements and policies. In 2014, she expressed concerns about the potential threat of a Chinese Communist invasion and later added Indonesia as a potential military threat. She called for the reintroduction of national service and supported the reintroduction of the death penalty for Australian citizens who leave the country to become foreign fighters.

Lambie also made headlines for her views on Islam, calling for a ban on the burqa in Australia and attacking supporters of Islamic sharia law. However, she distanced herself from these views later on, stating that she didn't want to be divisive.

Lambie also criticized The Australian Greens, accusing them of destroying all hope in Tasmania and likening them to Islamic State. However, in 2020, Lambie worked alongside The Greens in criticising a bill that would 'weaken' political donation laws.

One of Lambie's main policy initiatives was the establishment of a Royal Commission into Veteran Suicide. She called for this in response to a Change.org petition organised by Julie-Ann Finney, whose son David Finney took his own life after a crippling battle with Post-Traumatic Stress injury. As of 20 April 2021, the petition had over 400,000 signatures.

Lambie was appointed as a Senator for Tasmania in 2013, representing the Palmer United Party, but resigned from the party in 2014 due to conflicts with the party's founder, Clive Palmer. She then served as an independent senator until she was re-elected in 2016 under her own political party, the Jacqui Lambie Network.

In November 2019, Lambie announced that she would be resigning from the Senate due to a citizenship issue, which was later resolved. She resigned from the Senate in January 2020 but left the door open for a possible return to politics in the future.

Overall, Jacqui Lambie's political career was marked by controversy and a willingness to speak out on difficult issues. While some of her policies and statements were divisive, she was also known for her advocacy on behalf of veterans and her willingness to work with political opponents on issues of common concern.
