Tammy Tyrrell, a notable Australian senator and member of the Jacqui Lambie Network, was born on August 1, 1970. She rose to prominence after her successful election to represent Tasmania in the Senate during the 2022 Australian federal election, where she won the sixth vacancy.

Tammy spent her early years in Ulverstone, Tasmania, where she grew up and received her education. Despite not attending university, she pursued a successful career spanning 15 years in employment services. However, it was her tenure as a staff member for Senator Jacqui Lambie, a prominent figure in Australian politics, that paved the way for her eventual foray into politics.

In 2014, Tammy joined Senator Lambie's team and served in various capacities for almost a decade until 2022. She gained valuable experience and knowledge of Australian politics during this time, which made her a natural choice to lead the Jacqui Lambie Network's Senate ticket for the 2022 federal election.

Tammy's political acumen and her dedication to serving her constituents helped her win the election, unseating incumbent senator Eric Abetz. She began her six-year term on July 1, 2022, and continues to work tirelessly to make a positive impact in the Senate and the lives of Australians.
