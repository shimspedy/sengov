Wendy Anne Askew is an Australian politician currently serving as a Senator for Tasmania representing the Liberal Party. Born on March 16, 1963, in Launceston, Tasmania, she comes from a family of politicians. Her father, Max Bushby, and her brother, David Bushby, were also Liberal politicians.

Before venturing into politics, Askew had an extensive career in both the public and private sectors. She worked as a general manager for the St Giles Society, which provides disability services. She also spent 20 years working in the banking industry with organizations like Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank. In addition, she worked as an office manager for state MP Michael Ferguson, an advisor to state MP Sarah Courtney and federal MP Andrew Nikolic, and as an advisor to the federal education minister Dan Tehan.

Askew has held several senior positions in the Tasmanian Liberals party, including serving on the state executive, as party treasurer, and as a senior vice-president of the party. She was also a candidate for Senate preselection for the 2019 federal election.

In January 2019, her brother, David Bushby, announced his retirement from the Senate, and Askew was subsequently chosen to fill his vacancy. She defeated seven other candidates to become the Liberal Party's nominee for the casual vacancy caused by his resignation. On March 6, 2019, she was temporarily appointed to the Senate by state governor Kate Warner, under the provisions of section 15 of the constitution, as the state parliament was not in session. Her appointment was later formalized by a joint sitting of the state parliament on March 20, 2019.

Askew made history as the fourth woman to represent the Tasmanian Liberals in federal parliament, and the first since Jocelyn Newman retired in 2002. After the Coalition's defeat at the 2022 federal election, she was appointed Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate, a significant role in the party's leadership team.
