Gavin Pearce is an Australian politician who currently serves as a member of the House of Representatives, representing the Division of Braddon in Tasmania. He was elected to this position in the 2019 federal election and was re-elected in 2022 with an increased vote share.

Pearce was born in Tasmania and comes from a family that has been farming in the region for generations. He served in the army for 20 years and was stationed in East Timor before returning to Tasmania to work as a farmer and become involved in local community organizations. In 2018, he won Liberal preselection for the Division of Braddon and went on to win the federal election in 2019, defeating the incumbent Labor MP.

Pearce is a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party and has been appointed to the Shadow ministry of Peter Dutton as Assistant Shadow Minister for Health, Aged Care and Indigenous Health Services since 2022.

Pearce has faced personal tragedy, having lost his first wife to lymphoma in 2009. He has since become engaged and has a daughter with his current partner, Megan McGinty.
