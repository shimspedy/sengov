Daniel Repacholi is an Australian sport shooter and politician who has competed in four Olympic Games. He was born on May 15, 1982, and grew up in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales. Repacholi started his shooting career at the age of 12 and won his first national title at the age of 19. He is a former coal miner and currently runs a small engineering business with 60 employees.

In his shooting career, Repacholi has competed in various international shooting events including the Commonwealth Games, World Championships, and the Olympic Games. He won a gold medal and a bronze medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and a gold medal in the 10m Air Pistol and a bronze in the 50m Pistol events at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

In addition to his sports career, Repacholi is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and was elected as a member for the New South Wales seat of Hunter in the 2022 election after the retirement of Joel Fitzgibbon. He has stated a focus on supporting the mining industry and improving employment opportunities for tradesmen, trainees, and apprentices. However, some rank and file Labor members were unhappy with the lack of a rank and file vote to choose Repacholi as a candidate, as well as his support of coal mining.

Repacholi has also been involved in controversy over his social media activity. He has published sexually explicit comments and followed Instagram accounts featuring naked women posing with assault rifles and near-naked women in sexually provocative poses. He has publicly apologized for these actions and deleted his Instagram account.

Despite these controversies, Repacholi remains a respected figure in the sport shooting community. He is a member of the Cessnock Hall of Fame, having been inducted in May 2020 for services to sport.
