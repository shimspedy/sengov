Paul William Fletcher, born on January 16, 1965, is an Australian politician and former Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts, who served in that capacity from 2020 to 2022. He is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia and has been a member of parliament (MP) for the division of Bradfield since 2009.

Fletcher's interest in politics began at a young age when he joined the Young Liberals at just 16 years old. However, he started his professional career in the corporate world, working as a management consultant, a corporate lawyer for Mallesons Stephen Jaques, and a corporate strategist for TNT Limited. In 1996, he became the chief of staff to Minister for Communications Richard Alston, a Liberal Party politician, a role he held until 2000. After that, he worked for Optus as director of corporate and regulatory affairs until 2008, during which he became a staunch opponent of Telstra, accusing the company of being a monopoly.

In 2009, Fletcher won preselection from a field of 17 people to be the Liberal Party candidate at the 2009 Bradfield by-election, following the retirement of former Liberal leader Brendan Nelson. This was his first foray into politics, and he was successful in winning the seat. He served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications from 2013 to 2015 under the Abbott ministry, and between September 2015 and July 2016, he served as the Minister for Major Projects, Territories, and Local Government. He briefly served as the Minister for Territories, Local Government and Major Projects between October and December 2017. He served as Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities from July 2016 to August 2018 in the second Turnbull ministry, and Minister for Families and Social Services in the first Morrison ministry.

Fletcher is one of seven Liberal MPs in the 46th Parliament of Australia who obtained degrees at an Oxbridge or Ivy League university, graduating with first-class honours in economics and laws from the University of Sydney. At university, he also co-wrote two plays, titled The Fax of Life and Annually Fixated. In 1993, Fletcher was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to attend Columbia University's Graduate School of Business in New York City, where he completed a Master of Business Administration degree.

Fletcher's early life saw him being born in Devizes, Wiltshire, England, to Clive and Mary Fletcher, with his father being a professor of computational engineering. He arrived in Australia with his family at the age of two, and held British citizenship until 2009 when he renounced it to stand for parliament.

Fletcher is married to jeweler Manuela Zappacosta, and together they have one son. They also live with her son from a previous marriage. In June 2022, he was appointed Manager of Opposition Business in the House. Fletcher is a member of the Moderate/Modern Liberal faction of the Liberal Party.
