Jason Dean Clare is an Australian politician who currently serves as the Minister for Education since June 1, 2022. He was born on March 22, 1972, and has been a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) since his early days. Clare has been representing the Division of Blaxland in Western Sydney since 2007, after winning preselection against the incumbent Labor MP Michael Hatton.

Clare's political career started in 2009 when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Employment, and in September 2010, he was promoted to the Ministry as the Minister for Defence Materiel in the Rudd-Gillard Governments. Later, he served as Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice, Cabinet Secretary, and retained Blaxland in the 2010 and 2013 federal elections.

In 2013, after Labor's defeat, Clare became a senior member of the shadow cabinet under opposition leaders Bill Shorten and Anthony Albanese. He served as Shadow Minister for Communications, Resources and Northern Australia, Trade and Investment, Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, and Housing and Homelessness.

After the ALP's victory in the 2022 Australian federal election, Clare returned to the ministry as the Minister for Education in the Albanese Government. He has been touted as a future ALP leader, but he has denied any interest in becoming one, stating that he only wishes to reach the role of Minister for Education.

Clare completed his education from the University of New South Wales, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) and a Bachelor of Laws. Before joining politics, he was the secretary of the Cabramatta Branch for ten years and worked as a senior adviser to former NSW Premier Bob Carr and an executive at Transurban, one of Australia's Top 100 companies.

Clare is a member of the Labor Right faction and supports same-sex marriage. His electorate had the highest percentage of "No" responses in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey of 2017, with 73.9% of the electorate's respondents saying "No." In January 2023, he commented on the ongoing case regarding Kanye West's visa application, stating that he believed West should have his visa denied for his praise of Adolf Hitler and his history of anti-semitic comments.
