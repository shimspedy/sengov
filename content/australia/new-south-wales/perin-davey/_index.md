Born on February 5, 1972, Perin McGregor Davey is a National Party politician from Australia who became a Senator for New South Wales after winning the 2019 Australian federal election. She currently serves as the Senate whip of her party. Following the 2022 federal election, she was chosen as the Deputy Leader of the National Party by her party on May 30, 2022.

Davey spent her childhood in Canberra and attended Curtin Primary School and Alfred Deakin High School. Later, she worked as a cadet journalist for the Mudgee Guardian for three years and also appeared on various TV shows as an extra. She worked for several organizations as a consultant and a water policy adviser before entering politics.

Davey served on the board of the New South Wales Irrigators' Council from 2014 to 2016 and was nominated to the board of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority by federal agriculture and water minister Barnaby Joyce in 2017. However, she withdrew her nomination after it was revealed that a New South Wales government official had offered her government data to "help irrigators exploit the Murray-Darling Basin Plan."

Davey has been a member of the National Party since 1998 and held various positions in the New South Wales branch before her election to the Senate in 2019. She is married to John Dickie and has two daughters. Her family lives on a property in Conargo, and as of 2019, she also owned an investment property in Canberra.
