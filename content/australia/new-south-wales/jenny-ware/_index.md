Jennifer Leslie Ware is an Australian politician affiliated with the Liberal Party who was elected to the House of Representatives in the 2022 federal election, representing the electorate of Hughes in New South Wales. She grew up in Cronulla, New South Wales, and attended South Cronulla Primary School and St George Girls High School. Ware has a legal background, specializing in planning and environmental law, and worked for both private law firms and the government sector.

Ware joined the Liberal Party in 2002 and had been a member for many years before leaving and rejoining in 2021. She was selected as the Liberal candidate for the 2022 federal election by a committee comprising Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Premier Dominic Perrottet, and former federal Liberal Party president Chris McDiven after the local preselection ballot was cancelled amidst controversy. Ware was backed by the moderate faction of the party, of which she is a member, and won the seat of Hughes with a swing of –9.3% against the Liberal party on first preferences and –2.79% on the two-candidate preferred count.

Ware has been a member of the House Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care & Sport, House Standing Committee on Social Policy & Legal Affairs, and Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme since August 2022. She participates in several parliamentary friendship groups, including the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia, the Parliamentary Friends of Israel, the Parliamentary Friends of Nuclear Industries, the Parliamentary Friends of Organ Donation, and the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention.

Ware's personal life includes volunteering with the Sylvanvale Foundation, a disability support organization, and serving as President of the Gymea Bay P&C. She lives in Gymea Bay with her husband, Mike, and their two sons. The couple has been married since 1999, and as of 2021, Ware was the part-owner of three properties. During the 2022 election campaign, Ware expressed support for the use of nuclear power in Australia and stated that she had played softball with and against transgender women, disagreeing with Katherine Deves' views on transgender women.
