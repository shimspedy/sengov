O'Neill's work in Parliament focuses on building a strong economy and a fair society by addressing issues such as wage theft, rebuilding trust in franchising, and improving auditing in Australia. She is passionate about ensuring that all Australians, regardless of their circumstances, have access to secure work, income, and a world-class health and education system.

O'Neill was elected to the Senate in 2016 and has held several parliamentary positions, including Temporary Chair of Committees and Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Health.
