Alison Joy Byrnes is an Australian politician who currently serves as a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and represents the New South Wales seat of Cunningham in the House of Representatives. Born and raised in Wollongong, New South Wales, Byrnes spent most of her childhood in the suburb of Woonona.

Byrnes' involvement in politics began at a young age, as she started working for the ALP at the age of 16. Her passion for politics led her to work as a staffer for Cunningham MP Sharon Bird for 18 years, including as chief of staff.

In February 2022, Byrnes won ALP preselection for Cunningham following Bird's retirement. Her main opponent, Misha Zelinsky, withdrew from the race, leaving Byrnes unopposed. At the 2022 Federal Election, she ran for the seat of Cunningham and was elected with 65% of the vote.

Apart from her political career, Byrnes is married to Paul Scully, an ALP member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. She has occasionally used the name "Alison Byrnes-Scully".

Byrnes' political career is a testament to her commitment to public service and her ability to inspire change. Her dedication to serving the people of Cunningham has earned her the respect and admiration of her constituents, and she continues to work tirelessly towards creating a better future for all Australians.
