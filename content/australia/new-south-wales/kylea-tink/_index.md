Kylea Jane Tink is an accomplished Australian professional with expertise in communications, campaigning, business, and politics. She was born in Coonabarabran, New South Wales, on September 5, 1970, and attended Coonabarabran High School before studying at Australian National University.

Tink is well known for her contributions to various organizations, including Edelman Australia, the McGrath Foundation, and Camp Quality. She served as the managing director of Edelman Australia, the world's largest public relations firm, and provided pro-bono PR consulting to the McGrath Foundation, where she later became CEO. Tink played a key role in establishing the Pink Test, a cricketing fundraiser that raises awareness and funds for breast cancer care in Australia. During her tenure as CEO, the number of breast care nurses in Australia increased significantly. She later became CEO of Camp Quality, where she implemented several organizational changes, including starting a camp for children of parents diagnosed with cancer.

In September 2021, Tink announced her candidacy for the seat of North Sydney in the 2022 federal election, and she won the seat in May 2022. Tink, along with other independent politicians who won seats in the election, has been described as a teal independent. During her campaign, she focused on climate policy and equality in society. However, it was later revealed that she owned shares in two energy companies, which drew criticism from opposition leader Peter Dutton.

In November 2022, Tink tabled her first private members bill, the Fuel and Vehicle Standards Legislation Amendment (Reducing Vehicle Pollution) Bill 2022, advocating for cleaner, cheaper fuel. She also supports a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament and the "Yes" vote in the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum.

Tink currently resides in Northbridge, Sydney, with her three children.
