Meryl Jane Swanson is an Australian politician who currently serves as the Member of Parliament for the Division of Paterson in the Australian House of Representatives. She was born on September 3rd, 1970, in Kurri Kurri, New South Wales. Swanson grew up in the nearby town of Heddon Greta and obtained a Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Newcastle.

After completing her studies, Swanson worked in broadcasting for several years, first as a researcher, producer, and reporter for NBN Television and then as a presenter with 2KO. She also worked as a business manager for the Hunter Region Organisation of Councils from 1993 to 1996 and as an electorate officer for Joel Fitzgibbon from 1996 to 1997. Swanson later became the executive director of Hunter Tourism in 1997. After starting a family, she operated a caf√© for several years and then returned to radio, working with 2HD and 2NUR.

Swanson's political career began in 2016 when she ran for parliament and won the seat for the Labor Party in the Division of Paterson. She retained the seat at the 2019 election despite a five-point swing against the ALP. In August 2020, she was appointed as the Shadow Assistant Minister for Defence in Anthony Albanese's shadow ministry.

Swanson is a member of the Labor Right faction and has been a vocal advocate for coal workers in the transition towards a low-emissions future. She has urged MPs to be careful about the way they talk about taking action on climate change, arguing that coal workers should not feel demonized.

Swanson is married to Nick, and they have two daughters. They live on a 50-acre (20 ha) property in Buchanan. As of 2019, Swanson was also a co-owner and director of Swanridge Investments Pty Ltd, which sells horse rugs.
