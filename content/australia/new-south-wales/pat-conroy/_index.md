Patrick Martin Conroy is an Australian politician and member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). He was born on May 10, 1979, in Sydney but moved to the Central Coast of New South Wales at the age of one. His parents were active union delegates and long-time Labor activists. Conroy attended Ettalong Public School and Gosford High School, where he played for the Woy Woy Football Club and the Gosford Rugby Club.

He joined the ALP in 1994 and served as a state and federal vice-president of Australian Young Labor from 2003 to 2004. He holds a Bachelor of Economics (Hons.) from the University of Sydney. Before entering parliament, Conroy worked as an electorate officer, industrial/policy officer, policy adviser, and principal policy adviser. He was also the deputy chief of staff to Greg Combet.

Conroy was elected to parliament in 2013, representing the Division of Charlton in New South Wales until its abolition in 2016, and then represented the Division of Shortland. He is aligned with the ALP's Socialist Left faction and serves as one of the two federal parliamentary convenors of the Labor Left faction, along with Andrew Giles.

He has held several positions in the shadow ministry, including as an assistant minister for infrastructure and climate change and energy under Bill Shorten. He was also Shadow Minister for International Development and the Pacific, as well as minister assisting in the portfolios of climate change, defence, and government accountability under Anthony Albanese.

Currently, Conroy is the Minister for Defence Industry and Minister for International Development and the Pacific. He renounced his British citizenship, which he held by descent through his father, before standing in the 2013 election in accordance with section 44 of the constitution.
