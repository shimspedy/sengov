#### About David
David Bernard Coleman was born on 5 March 1974 in Camden, a south-western suburb of Sydney. He attended Saint Thomas Ã  Becket primary school in Lewisham and Christian Brothers' High School in the same suburb. Coleman pursued higher education at the University of New South Wales, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws. In 1997, he became the president of the UNSW Student Guild.

Prior to entering politics, Coleman worked for various companies, including McKinsey & Co, LookSmart, dStore, PBL Media, and the Nine Network, where he served as the director of strategy and digital. He contested Liberal preselection contests for Cook in 2007 and Bradfield in 2010 but did not receive the party's endorsement. Before his election to Parliament, Coleman held directorships with ninemsn Pty Limited, Australian News Channel Pty Limited, and Yellow Brick Road Holdings Limited.

Coleman began his political career in 2013 when he was elected to the House of Representatives for the seat of Banks, defeating incumbent Labor member Daryl Melham, who had held the seat for 23 years. Coleman recorded a two-party preferred swing of 3.28 points in his favour, becoming the first non-Labor member to hold the seat since it was created in 1949.

In December 2017, Coleman was appointed Assistant Minister for Finance in the Second Turnbull Ministry. He later supported Scott Morrison in the leadership spills in August 2018 and was subsequently appointed Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs in the First Morrison Ministry. After the government's re-election at the 2019 election, his portfolio was expanded to include Migrant Services, and his title changed to Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs.

In December 2019, Coleman announced he would be taking indefinite leave for personal reasons, with Alan Tudge taking over his portfolio as acting minister. Coleman formally remained as a minister until a December 2020 reshuffle, in which he was instead appointed Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention. He held this position until May 2022, following the appointment of the Albanese ministry.

Coleman is a member of the Moderate/Modern Liberal faction of the Liberal Party and was in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage in the 2017 postal survey. He is married to Dotte Derrickson, and they have two children.
