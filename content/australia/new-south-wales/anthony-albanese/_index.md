Anthony Albanese is an Australian politician who is the current leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). He was born on March 2, 1963, in Sydney, New South Wales, and grew up in public housing in Camperdown, a suburb of Sydney. Albanese was raised by a single mother and attended St Mary's Cathedral College and the University of Sydney.

Before entering politics, Albanese worked as a research officer for the NSW Labor Council and as a ministerial adviser to the NSW Minister for Education, Terry Metherell. He was first elected to parliament in 1996 as the member for the seat of Grayndler in Sydney's inner-west. Albanese has held several senior positions within the ALP, including serving as the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government.

Albanese is known for his progressive views on social and economic issues, including advocating for workers' rights and climate action. He has been a vocal supporter of same-sex marriage and has campaigned for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community.

In May 2019, Albanese was elected as the leader of the ALP following the party's defeat in the federal election. As leader, he has sought to unite the party and re-energize its base, focusing on policies such as improving public transport, investing in renewable energy, and increasing wages for low-paid workers.

Albanese is also an avid sports fan, particularly of rugby league, and is known for his love of the South Sydney Rabbitohs, a rugby league team based in Sydney. He is married to former NSW state MP Carmel Tebbutt and they have one son together.
