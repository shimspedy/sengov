Scott John Morrison was born on 13 May 1968 and is an Australian politician who currently serves as the 30th Prime Minister of Australia. He has been in office since August 2018 and is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia. Prior to becoming the Prime Minister, Morrison served as the Treasurer of Australia from 2015 to 2018, and before that, he held various ministerial positions in the Australian government since 2013.

Morrison was born in Sydney and grew up in the suburb of Bronte. He attended the University of New South Wales and studied economic geography. After graduation, he worked in various roles in tourism and marketing before entering politics.

In 2007, Morrison was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the member for the Division of Cook in New South Wales. During his time in parliament, he has been a vocal advocate for immigration and border protection policies, and has also been a strong supporter of the Australian military.

As Prime Minister, Morrison has overseen a range of policies and initiatives, including the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, infrastructure spending, and tax reform. He has also been a strong advocate for the Australian economy and has sought to promote trade and investment with other countries around the world.


Before entering politics, Morrison worked in tourism and marketing, including serving as the Managing Director of Tourism Australia from 2004 to 2006. In this role, he oversaw the "Where the bloody hell are you?" advertising campaign that generated controversy but also gained international attention.

Morrison is a devout Christian and has been open about his faith influencing his politics. He attends the Horizon Church, a Pentecostal church in Sydney.

Morrison has been a strong advocate for border protection and immigration policies, including the controversial policy of offshore processing for asylum seekers who arrive by boat. He has argued that this policy is necessary to deter people smugglers and prevent deaths at sea, while critics have accused it of being inhumane and violating international law.

In 2019, Morrison led the Liberal-National Coalition to a surprise victory in the federal election, defeating the Labor Party and securing a majority government. This was seen as a significant achievement given the Coalition's low polling numbers leading up to the election.

Morrison has faced criticism for his government's response to the bushfire crisis that swept through Australia in late 2019 and early 2020, with some accusing him of not doing enough to address climate change and mitigate the effects of the fires. However, he also received praise for his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the successful rollout of vaccines in Australia.

In addition to his political career, Morrison is known for his love of sport, particularly rugby league. He is a lifelong fan of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and has been known to attend games and wear team merchandise in public.
