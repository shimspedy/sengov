Tanya Plibersek is an Australian politician and member of the Australian Labor Party. She was born on December 2, 1969, in Sydney, Australia. Tanya grew up in the inner-city suburb of Marrickville and attended local public schools before going on to complete a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Politics and Public Policy at the University of Sydney.

In 1998, Tanya was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Member for Sydney, becoming the youngest woman ever elected to the NSW Parliament. During her time in the NSW Parliament, Tanya held a number of senior positions, including Shadow Minister for Health, Shadow Minister for Women, and Shadow Minister for Education.

In 2004, Tanya was elected to the Australian Parliament as the Member for Sydney. She has since been re-elected to the House of Representatives at every election, and in 2007, was appointed Shadow Minister for Housing and Shadow Minister for the Status of Women.

Tanya has held a number of senior positions in the Australian Labor Party, including Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party. In 2013, she was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development, a position she held until 2019.

Throughout her career, Tanya has been a strong advocate for social justice, equality, and human rights. She has been a vocal supporter of marriage equality, and played a key role in the successful campaign to legalise same-sex marriage in Australia in 2017. Tanya has also been a strong advocate for women's rights, and has championed policies to address domestic and family violence, and to improve access to affordable childcare.

Tanya is widely regarded as a highly intelligent and effective politician, with a reputation for being a passionate and articulate advocate for her beliefs. She is married and has three children.
