Angus Taylor is an Australian politician who has been a member of the Australian House of Representatives since 2013, representing the rural New South Wales electorate of Hume. He is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia and has served as Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction since May 2019.

#### Early Life and Education
Angus Taylor was born in Nimmitabel, a small town in the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales, in 1966. He grew up on his family's farm near the town and attended local schools before going on to study at the University of Sydney, where he earned a Bachelor of Economics and a Bachelor of Laws.

#### Career in Business
After completing his education, Taylor worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company and then as a partner at Port Jackson Partners, a strategy consulting firm based in Sydney. He also co-founded a company called Farm Street Partners, which specializes in agribusiness investment.

#### Political Career
In 2013, Taylor was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Hume, a largely rural electorate in southern New South Wales. He was re-elected in 2016 and 2019, and has been a vocal advocate for the interests of farmers and regional communities in parliament.

In September 2015, Taylor was appointed Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, with responsibility for Cities and Digital Transformation. He was later promoted to Minister for Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity in December 2017, and then to Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction in May 2019.

#### Controversies
Taylor has been the subject of several controversies during his political career. In 2019, he was accused of using his influence to benefit a family-owned company, Jam Land Pty Ltd, in which he had an interest. He denied any wrongdoing, but the matter was referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation.

In 2020, Taylor was embroiled in another controversy over his use of a doctored document in a speech to parliament about the Sydney City Council's travel expenses. The document, which purported to show that the council had spent $15 million on travel in one year, was later found to be inaccurate and had been altered to inflate the figure. Taylor initially denied any involvement in the alteration of the document, but later admitted that his office had been responsible for providing the information.

#### Personal Life
Taylor is married and has four children. He and his family live on a farm near Goulburn in the Hume electorate. In addition to his political and business activities, Taylor is also a keen sportsman and has competed in triathlons and marathons.
