Emma Margaret McBride is an Australian politician who was born in Sydney on 27 April 1975. She is the second of eight children of Barbara and Grant McBride. Her father was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1992. McBride lived in different places during her childhood, including Western Sydney, Inner West, Nauru, and the Central Coast.

McBride completed her Bachelor of Pharmacy at the University of Sydney and her graduate diploma in public sector management at Flinders University. She worked as a pharmacist in different places around New South Wales, as well as in Oxford, England. In 2006, McBride returned to the Central Coast as a specialist mental health pharmacist at Wyong Hospital, where she later became the hospital's chief pharmacist. She also served as a director of the Wyong Community Bank branch of Bendigo Bank and as a board member of the Central Coast Heart netball team.

McBride joined the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1992 and served on the Wyong Shire Council from 2008 to 2012. In August 2013, she won ALP preselection for the federal seat of Dobell, but was defeated by the Liberal candidate Karen McNamara in the 2013 federal election. McBride reprised her candidacy in 2016 and was elected as the member for Dobell in the Australian House of Representatives.

After the 2019 federal election, McBride was included in Anthony Albanese's shadow ministry as a shadow assistant minister in the mental health and carers portfolios. In December 2020, she was appointed deputy chair of the House Standing Committee on Communications and the Arts, and in February 2021, she was appointed deputy chair of the Select Committee on Mental Health and Suicide Prevention. McBride was re-elected at the 2022 federal election and was appointed Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Notably, McBride obtained Irish citizenship by descent in 2001, but renounced it prior to standing for parliament in 2013.
