Patrick John Conaghan is an Australian politician and member of the House of Representatives for Cowper in New South Wales, representing the Nationals since 2019. He was born on 31 January 1971 in Kempsey, New South Wales.

Before entering federal politics, Conaghan had a successful career in law enforcement. He worked as a police officer in Kempsey and later as a detective and police prosecutor in Sydney. He also served as a councillor for Tunks Ward of North Sydney Council from 2004 to 2008. After leaving law enforcement, Conaghan became a lawyer and established his own practice, Conaghan Lawyers, specialising in criminal defence.

In the 2019 Australian federal election, Conaghan was elected to the House of Representatives for the electoral division of Cowper, succeeding retiring incumbent Luke Hartsuyker.

Recently, Conaghan attracted media attention in August 2022 for his remarks about Australian Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather's attire in Parliament House. Despite Speaker Milton Dick's dismissal of his concern, Conaghan continued to complain about the MP's lack of tie, stating, "This is not a barbecue. This is question time in the Australian parliament. What next, board shorts and thongs? Maybe a onesie in winter". The House of Representatives Practice rulebook, however, states that attire is at the discretion of the Speaker.

Conaghan resides in Port Macquarie, New South Wales, with his wife Ilona and their two children.
