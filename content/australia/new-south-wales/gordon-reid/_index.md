Gordon James Reid is a physician and politician from Australia. Born on 16 August 1992, he grew up on the Central Coast of New South Wales, on Darkinjung country, and is of Wiradjuri descent. Reid attended Umina Beach Public School and Central Coast Grammar School before completing his B.Med. degree at the University of Newcastle in 2016.

Reid worked as an emergency doctor before running for Parliament in the 2022 Australian federal election as a Labor candidate. He was motivated to run for office while working in the Emergency Department at Wyong Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and observing people waiting for treatment. Reid won the election and defeated the incumbent Liberal MP, Lucy Wicks, becoming one of six First Nations people in the Labor Caucus.

Reid co-chairs the Parliamentary friends of the Uluru Statement, a non-partisan group launched on 13 February 2023 to support the "Yes" campaign for the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum, alongside Bridget Archer of the Liberal Party and Independent Allegra Spender.

In his personal life, Reid is fluent in Indonesian and plays the saxophone.
