Chris Bowen is an Australian politician who has served as a member of parliament for the Division of McMahon in the House of Representatives since 2010. Bowen is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and has held various portfolios, including the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Minister for Financial Services, and the Treasurer of Australia.

Early life and education:
Born in Sydney in 1973, Bowen grew up in Smithfield and attended the University of Western Sydney, where he completed a Bachelor of Economics degree. He then went on to complete a Master of International Relations degree at Macquarie University.

Political career:
Bowen was first elected to parliament in 2004, representing the Division of Prospect. In 2006, he was appointed to the position of Assistant Treasurer and held the role until the 2007 federal election. After the election, Bowen became the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, a role he held until 2013. During his tenure, he oversaw significant reforms to Australia's immigration policies and processes, including the introduction of a points-based system for skilled migrants.

In 2013, Bowen was appointed as the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation, and Corporate Law. He held this position until the ALP lost the 2013 federal election. Bowen has also served as the Shadow Treasurer of Australia and played a key role in developing the ALP's economic policies.

In 2019, Bowen announced his candidacy for the leadership of the ALP following the party's defeat in the federal election. However, he withdrew from the race, citing a lack of support. He has since served as the Shadow Minister for Health and the Shadow Minister for Climate Change and Energy.

Personal life:
Bowen is married to Rebecca Gorman, and they have two children. In 2018, he underwent successful treatment for multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer. He is an avid rugby league fan and supports the Parramatta Eels.
