Warren Entsch is an Australian politician and member of the House of Representatives representing the Division of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland. He was first elected to parliament in 1996 and has been re-elected at every election since.

Born in 1950 in Melbourne, Victoria, Entsch grew up in Cairns, Queensland where he attended Cairns State High School. After leaving school, he worked as a jackaroo in remote areas of Australia before moving into the tourism industry in the early 1970s.

In 1980, Entsch was elected to the Cairns City Council, where he served for 16 years, including as Deputy Mayor. During his time on the council, he also served as a member of the Regional Development Council and as a director of the Cairns and District Tourist Promotion Bureau.

In 1996, Entsch was elected to the House of Representatives as the Member for Leichhardt, representing the Liberal Party. During his time in parliament, he has held a number of positions including Chairman of the Coalition Northern Australia Committee and the Northern Australia Development Committee, as well as Deputy Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.

In addition to his parliamentary work, Entsch has been involved in a range of community organisations and initiatives, including the Cairns Chamber of Commerce, the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service, and the Rotary Club of Cairns Sunrise.

Entsch is a strong advocate for the environment, particularly for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, and has been involved in a number of conservation and sustainability initiatives throughout his career. He is also a vocal supporter of small business and regional development, and has worked to promote economic growth and job creation in Far North Queensland.

Entsch has received numerous awards and honours for his service to the community, including the Order of Australia Medal in 2001 and the Centenary Medal in 2003. He is widely respected as a dedicated and hardworking representative for the people of Leichhardt and continues to serve as a strong voice for regional Queensland in the Australian Parliament.
