Elizabeth Watson-Brown MP was born on October 12, 1956, in Australia. She is a well-known architect and politician, currently serving as a member of the Australian Greens and representing the Division of Ryan, Queensland, since winning the 2022 Australian federal election. Her victory in the election was significant, as she defeated Julian Simmonds, who held the previously safe Liberal National seat.

As a member of the Australian Greens, Watson-Brown is the first woman to represent the party in the lower house. She is an accomplished architect who has been running her own architectural business in western Brisbane for over two decades. Her career has focused on sustainable design, greening cities, urban resilience, accessibility, and social equity.

Watson-Brown's impressive architectural portfolio includes designing the Ngungun House on the Sunshine Coast, her first house, which was designed and built in the 1990s. She practiced in Tasmania before moving back to Queensland. She was also involved in the highly controversial 443 Queen Street development in Brisbane. The residential tower was the first in Australia to receive a 6 Star Green Star rating by the Green Building Council of Australia and has been described as "sub-tropical."

In addition to her architecture work, Watson-Brown is an adjunct professor of architecture at the University of Queensland and has held numerous design advisory and jury roles. She is a life fellow of the Australian Institute of Architects and has been Queensland State Awards director and National Awards juror.

Watson-Brown's passion for sustainable design, accessibility, and social equity has led her to pursue a political career. She ran for the Division of Ryan, Queensland, as a member of the Australian Greens in the 2022 Australian federal election, campaigning on issues such as climate change, affordable housing, and renewable energy. Her victory in the election marked a significant milestone for the Greens and is a testament to her commitment to creating a more sustainable and equitable society.
