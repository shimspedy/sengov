Stephen James Bates is an Australian politician, who was elected as the member for the Division of Brisbane in the 2022 Australian federal election, representing the Australian Greens. Bates defeated the sitting Liberal member and former National Retail Association CEO, Trevor Evans, in a historic victory.

Bates was born on 23 November 1992, in Croydon, South London. His family moved to Australia during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, settling in the central Queensland town of Yeppoon. Bates pursued his higher education at the University of Queensland, where he initially enrolled in a Bachelor of International Hotel and Tourism Management degree.

During his studies, Bates went to the United States to pursue a work opportunity, where he encountered a coworker crying over whether to buy insulin or pay her rent. This experience led Bates to rethink his career path and convinced him to enter politics. He returned to Australia and changed his degree to a Bachelor of Social Science, with a major in social and public policy, which he graduated under.

Before entering politics, Bates worked as a retail employee and was a member of the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union. Bates became the nominee of the Australian Greens for the Division of Brisbane in the 2022 Australian federal election, defeating the incumbent MP Trevor Evans.

Bates' campaign for the 2022 election garnered national attention for its unconventional tactics. The campaign utilized geo-located Grindr advertisements with risqu√© slogans, such as promoting that "the best parliaments are hung". In an interview with radio station B105 FM, Bates credited the ads as a vital component of his election victory.

In his personal life, Bates is openly gay and joined the Greens on the night of the 2019 Federal election. He graduated from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Social Science, with a Major in Social and Public Policy.
