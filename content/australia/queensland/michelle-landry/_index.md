Michelle Leanne Landry is an Australian politician from the Liberal National Party of Queensland who has been a member of the House of Representatives since the 2013 federal election, representing the Division of Capricornia. She served as the Assistant Minister for Children and Families (2018–2022) and as the Assistant Minister for Northern Australia (2020–2022) in the Morrison government. Landry was born in Rockhampton, Queensland, and was educated at Hall State School and Rockhampton Girls Grammar. Prior to her political career, Landry worked as a pathology and medical biochemistry laboratory assistant from 1978 to 1985, and at the National Australia Bank from 1985 to 2007. She also ran a local bookkeeping business from 1999 to 2009.

Landry first contested the seat of Capricornia in the 2010 federal election, but lost to the long-term Labor MP Kirsten Livermore. She won the seat in the 2013 federal election following Livermore's retirement and was reelected in the 2016, 2019, and 2022 federal elections. In February 2018, Landry became the National Party's Chief Whip in the House of Representatives, but was replaced by Damian Drum following her appointment as an assistant minister.

In August 2018, Landry was appointed as the Assistant Minister for Children and Families in the Morrison government, and in February 2020, she was additionally appointed as the Assistant Minister for Northern Australia. She held both positions until May 2022, following the appointment of the Albanese ministry. Landry was the National Party's only female member of the ministry from February 2020 until Bridget McKenzie was reappointed in July 2021.

Landry has been involved in a number of controversies during her political career. In November 2014, she claimed to the media that she, her daughter, and son-in-law had been targeted with bullying and intimidation by representatives from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU). Landry did not make an official complaint about the alleged harassment to police or the union. In April 2016, Landry drew national attention when she repeatedly criticized her own government for being "wishy washy." Additionally, questions were raised after Adani attended a fundraiser for Landry's 2019 federal election campaign and made donations of $60,800 to the Liberal and National Parties. Landry is a strong backer of the controversial Adani Carmichael coal mine project.
