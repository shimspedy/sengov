Phillip Bruce Thompson, OAM, MP, is an Australian politician and a member of the House of Representatives. He represents the Division of Herbert and is affiliated with the Liberal National Party of Queensland. He was first elected in the 2019 Australian federal election, making him the youngest member of the lower house in the 46th Parliament.

Thompson was born in Armidale, New South Wales, in 1988. At the age of 17, he joined the Australian Army and underwent training at Kapooka and Singleton before being posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment in Townsville. In 2007, he was deployed to East Timor, and in May 2009, he was sent to Afghanistan, where he was injured by an improvised explosive device (IED) during a patrol. He spent several years recovering from physical and mental injuries caused by the incident, including memory loss, hearing loss, and mental health issues.

Before entering politics, Thompson was Queensland Young Australian of the Year. He also represented Australia at the inaugural Invictus Games in London in 2014 and coached the Powerlifting and wheelchair rugby teams at the 2016 event in Orlando, Florida. In 2018, he was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to the welfare of veterans.

As a member of parliament, Thompson has prioritized the well-being of Indigenous Australians and the defense community. In his first speech, he spoke of the need to recognize and value First Nations people and their culture and paid tribute to those who had made the ultimate sacrifice on operations in service to the nation and to veterans who had suffered mental health issues after their return.

Thompson is married to Jenna, and they have two daughters, Astin and Emery. During his campaign, he apologized to the Muslim community for directing violent threats towards Muslims on Facebook in 2012. He is a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party. Thompson's political career and personal life reflect his commitment to serving his constituents and promoting the well-being of veterans and Indigenous Australians.
