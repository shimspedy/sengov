Keith John Pitt is an Australian politician who represents the Division of Hinkler in Queensland as a member of the National Party. He was born on August 31, 1969, in Bundaberg, Queensland, where he grew up in Woongarra and attended Kepnock State High School before pursuing an electrical apprenticeship. Pitt later graduated with a degree in Bachelor of Engineering from the Queensland University of Technology.

Before entering politics, Pitt worked as an electrical fitter mechanic and then as an electrical engineer for Bundaberg Sugar. In 2002, he established the Australian Safety and Training Alliance, a workplace health and safety training provider. He also purchased two sugarcane farms with his wife, which were later sold to focus on the training business.

Pitt won the Liberal National Party of Queensland's preselection ballot for the Division of Hinkler in December 2012, following the retirement of the incumbent MP, Paul Neville. He has retained Hinkler for the party in the 2013, 2016, and 2019 federal elections. Pitt served as an assistant minister in the Turnbull government and later as Minister for Resources and Water in the Morrison government. He has been described as a strong advocate for nuclear power and has opposed the Paris Agreement on emission reductions.

Pitt is married to Allison, and they have three children together.
