Andrew Willcox is a prominent Australian politician, widely recognized for his leadership and contributions to the country's political scene. Willcox is currently a member of the House of Representatives, representing the division of Dawson since 2022. He is a member of the Liberal National Party and sits with the National Party in federal parliament.

Willcox was born and raised in the beautiful town of Bowen, Queensland. Growing up, he was exposed to the agricultural industry as a third-generation tomato farmer. He developed an understanding of the challenges faced by farmers in the region and vowed to use his position to bring positive change in the sector.

Willcox's political career began in 2012 when he was elected as the Division 6 councillor for the Whitsunday Regional Council. In recognition of his tireless efforts and contributions to the council, he was elected as the mayor of the Whitsunday Regional Council in 2016. He was subsequently re-elected to the same position in April 2020.

As mayor, Willcox made significant strides in the areas of tourism, economic development, and infrastructure. He championed several projects aimed at creating jobs and boosting the region's economy. These efforts earned him the respect and admiration of residents and leaders alike.

In August 2021, Willcox was selected as a Liberal National Party candidate for the division of Dawson, signaling his foray into federal politics. In April 2022, he took leave from his mayoralty role to contest the 2022 federal election. His hard work and dedication to the cause paid off when he was elected at the federal election on 21 May.

Willcox's election to the House of Representatives has opened up new opportunities for him to contribute to the development of Australia. As a member of the National Party, he has been an ardent advocate for the interests of farmers and regional communities. He continues to champion policies aimed at promoting regional development, creating jobs, and supporting small businesses.

Willcox is widely respected for his strong work ethic, integrity, and commitment to service. He is a dedicated family man and a proud father of two children. In his free time, he enjoys fishing, spending time with his family, and exploring the beauty of the Australian countryside.
