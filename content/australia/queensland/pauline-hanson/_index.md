Pauline Hanson is a controversial Australian politician and former leader of the One Nation party. She rose to prominence in the mid-1990s with her strong anti-immigration and anti-multiculturalism views, which attracted a significant following among working-class Australians. Her views were met with widespread criticism from politicians, academics, and church leaders, who warned that they threatened the stability of Australia's multicultural society.

Hanson's political career began in 1996 when she was elected as an independent member of the Australian parliament, representing the seat of Oxley in Queensland. She used her position to promote her anti-immigration and anti-multiculturalism views, which she believed were necessary to protect Australian jobs and culture. She gained national attention for her inflammatory speeches and interviews, which often included controversial statements about Indigenous Australians, Asian migrants, and Muslims.

Despite her controversial views, Hanson's popularity continued to grow, and she formed the One Nation party in 1997 to contest the federal election. The party campaigned on a platform of reducing immigration, protecting Australian jobs and culture, and opposing globalisation. One Nation won 11 seats in the federal parliament and became a significant force in Australian politics. However, the party's success was short-lived, and it was beset by internal divisions, financial scandals, and allegations of racism.

Hanson left One Nation in 2002 and went on to form several other political parties, but none achieved the same level of success as One Nation. In 2016, she made a political comeback and was elected to the Australian Senate as a member of One Nation. She continued to promote her anti-immigration and anti-multiculturalism views, and also campaigned on issues such as climate change, gun control, and government accountability.

Throughout her political career, Hanson has been a polarising figure in Australian politics. Her views have been widely criticised as racist and divisive, but she has also been praised by some for speaking out against what they see as the negative effects of globalisation and multiculturalism on Australian society. Hanson has also faced personal challenges, including a divorce and ongoing security concerns due to her political views.
