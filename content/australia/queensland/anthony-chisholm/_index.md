Anthony David Chisholm is an Australian politician and a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Born on 24 February 1978 in Brisbane, Chisholm grew up in the city's northern suburbs and attended Wavell State High School. He later graduated from Griffith University with a Bachelor of Arts majoring in politics and international relations.

Chisholm joined the ALP in 1995 and was the party's candidate in Warrego at the 2001 Queensland state election at the age of 22. He worked as an organizer from 2004 to 2007, initially with the national secretariat and then with the state branch, before joining the staff of opposition leader Kevin Rudd as an advisor. Chisholm served as state secretary of the ALP in Queensland from 2008 to 2014 and directed the party's successful campaign at the 2015 state election.

Before entering politics, Chisholm worked for Santos Limited, providing advice on maintaining mainstream political support amid an ongoing campaign against the coal seam gas (CSG) industry by environmental and landholder groups. Following the retirement of Senator Joe Ludwig, Chisholm won ALP preselection for the 2016 federal election and was elected to the Senate.

Chisholm is a member of the right faction of the Labor Party and has served on a number of committees. In February 2020, he was made chair of the Select Committee on Administration of Sports Grants. He was also Deputy Chair on the Inquiry into the destruction of 46,000-year-old caves at the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, which delivered its interim report in December 2020.

In the 2022 federal election, Chisholm was re-elected to the Senate and was appointed an assistant minister in the Albanese government after the party's victory at the election. He is currently serving as Assistant Minister for Education and Assistant Minister for Regional Development.
