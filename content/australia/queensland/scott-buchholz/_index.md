Scott Andrew Buchholz was born on March 27, 1968, in Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia. His childhood was marked by the untimely death of his father when he was just eight years old, leaving his mother to raise him and his three siblings on a widow's pension. Despite this difficult start, Buchholz went on to attend St. Brendan's College in Yeppoon.

After completing his studies, Buchholz worked as a ringer on a station in Kilcummin from 1985 to 1987 before moving to Emerald to work in the agri-finance industry. He eventually established his own freight and courier business, which he grew into a successful enterprise with 14 depots across the state, employing over 100 permanent staff and subcontractors.

Buchholz's interest in politics began when he joined the Queensland Nationals, serving as a delegate to state conference from 2007 and as chief of staff to the party's Senate leader Barnaby Joyce. In 2007, he stood as a Senate candidate for the party but was unsuccessful.

However, Buchholz's political career took off when he won preselection for the newly created Division of Wright in the 2010 federal election, defeating seven other candidates, including television presenter Bob La Castra and former MP Cameron Thompson. Despite his prior affiliation with the Nationals, Buchholz joined the parliamentary Liberal Party as the LNP had allocated his seat to the Liberals.

After the 2013 election, Buchholz was appointed as a government whip and was later appointed the Chief Government Whip in the House of Representatives in 2015. He was removed from the position in 2015, shortly after Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott as prime minister.

Buchholz subsequently served terms as chair of the joint standing committee on electoral matters in 2016 and the joint statutory committee on public works in 2018. He was appointed to the speaker's panel in September 2016.

During the 2018 Liberal leadership spills, Buchholz reportedly voted for Peter Dutton against Malcolm Turnbull in the first vote. Following the spills, Buchholz was appointed Assistant Minister for Roads and Transport in the Morrison government, a position he held until May 2022, following the appointment of the Albanese ministry.

Buchholz is a member of the Centre-Right faction of the Liberal Party and has taken positions in support of a Liberal-National party merger at the federal level. He has also expressed opposition to same-sex marriage, although he ultimately voted in favour of the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017 which legalised same-sex marriage in Australia.

Outside of politics, Buchholz has one daughter with his former wife. As of 2019, he owned a family home in Boonah, as well as investment properties in Blackwater and Dugandan.
