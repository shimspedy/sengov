Terry James Young is an Australian politician and member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Longman in Queensland. He was born on 20 February 1968 in Brisbane and attended Kallangur Primary School and Dakabin State High School but left school at the age of 15.

Before entering politics, Young had a successful business career, working as a sales assistant for Chandlers and later becoming a joint franchisee of The Good Guys and establishing Drummond Golf franchises.

In November 2018, he won preselection for the Division of Longman and went on to win the seat in the 2019 federal election, defeating incumbent Labor MP Susan Lamb with a four-point swing. He is a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland and sits with the Liberal Party in federal parliament.

Young serves on the House of Representatives Standing committees for "Employment, Education and Training", "Indigenous Affairs" and "Tax and Revenue". He is a member of the centre-right faction of the Liberal Party and has described himself as a conservative.

In his maiden speech to parliament, Young expressed his views on education and stated that children should not be "brain-washed with extreme left or right ideologies" but should hear a variety of perspectives including those on evolution, creation, different religions, climate change, and climate change skepticism.

Young has been married twice and has four children, one of whom died of sudden infant death syndrome. According to The Courier-Mail, he was named Caboolture's second most influential person in 2021.
