Shayne Kenneth Neumann is an Australian politician who has been serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Federal seat of Blair since November 2007. He was born on August 26, 1961, in Ipswich, Queensland. Despite neither of his parents completing high school, Neumann managed to obtain a Bachelor of Arts majoring in government and economics and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Queensland.

Before embarking on his political career, Neumann was a partner in the Brisbane-based law firm of Neumann and Turnour Lawyers, which he established at the young age of 26 in partnership with Matthew Turnour, the brother of former Federal MP Jim Turnour. Specializing in family law, he gained valuable experience and a strong reputation for his legal skills.

Neumann entered politics in 2004 as a candidate for the Labor party, but was heavily defeated by the sitting Liberal member Cameron Thompson in the federal election. Undeterred, he stood again in 2007 and emerged victorious thanks to a redistribution of electoral boundaries and a big Labor resurgence across the country. Since then, he has been re-elected in 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022, consistently strengthening his hold on the Blair seat.

Throughout his political career, Neumann has held several high-ranking positions, including Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing in March 2013. After the 2013 Federal election, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs and for Ageing. In 2016, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, and after the 2019 Federal election, he became Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Defence Personnel.

Neumann's political positions have been shaped by his personal experiences, including exposure to the twin evils of addiction to alcohol and gambling in his childhood and the poverty caused thereby. As a result, he is a strong advocate for social justice and policies that support disadvantaged communities.

Neumann is a Christian and has been described as part of the Labor Right. He was opposed to same-sex marriage until late 2015, but later confirmed his newfound support for it. He has also been against pushes to repeal Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, stating that the laws protect free speech while also safeguarding against racial hatred.
