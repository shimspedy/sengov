Malcolm Roberts is an Australian politician and former businessman born on May 3, 1955, in Disergarh, West Bengal, India. He immigrated to Australia in 1974 and became a citizen in 1976.

Roberts holds a Bachelor's degree in Engineering (Mechanical) from the University of Queensland and a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Chicago. He also has several certifications in business management.

Before entering politics, Roberts worked in various positions in the business sector, including as a senior executive in a multinational corporation, a director of a start-up company, and a management consultant. He is also known for his work as a climate change skeptic, having founded the Galileo Movement, a group that opposes mainstream scientific views on climate change.

Roberts first entered politics in 2016, when he was elected as a senator for Queensland representing the One Nation party. He has since been re-elected in 2019 as an independent senator after leaving the One Nation party in 2017.

As a senator, Roberts has been a vocal advocate for issues such as climate change skepticism, border security, and reducing government regulation. He has also been involved in controversy for his comments on various social and political issues.

Roberts is married and has three children.
