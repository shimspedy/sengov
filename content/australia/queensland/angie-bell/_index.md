Angie Marion Bell is an Australian politician who currently serves as the Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Moncrieff in Queensland, having been elected in the 2019 federal election. She is a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland and sits with the Liberal Party in federal parliament.

Bell was born on 11 July 1968 in Adelaide and attended Gawler High School, where she discovered her passion for music and learned to play the tenor saxophone. She went on to study music in Denmark after receiving a scholarship from Rotary International. Upon returning to Australia, Bell enrolled in the Elder Conservatorium of Music where she studied jazz, saxophone, and voice.

Before entering politics, Bell had a successful career as a professional musician for over 35 years. She also worked as a sales agent in various Australian states before settling in Queensland in 2002, where she worked with the National Retail Association as a consultant and workplace trainer. Bell later joined Paint Place and served as their visual merchandising manager from 2010 to 2015, and national business development manager from 2015 to 2018. In 2014, she wrote a book on rebranding and marketing for small businesses and also completed a graduate certificate in marketing from Griffith University.

Bell joined the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP) when she was 45 years old and served as the president of LNP Women Queensland from 2017 to 2019. In April 2019, Bell won LNP preselection for the Division of Moncrieff, replacing the retiring MP Steven Ciobo. She contested the 2019 federal election and won the seat for the Liberals, defeating eight other candidates in what was considered an "upset victory" according to The Australian.

Bell is a member of the Moderate/Modern Liberal faction of the Liberal Party and is known for being the first openly gay woman to represent a major party in the House of Representatives. She is also the second overall, after independent Kerryn Phelps, and the fifth gay woman in federal parliament. Bell has been in a long-term relationship with her partner Ros, who has four adult children.
