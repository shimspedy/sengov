Garth Russell Hamilton is an Australian politician and member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Groom. Born on March 5th, 1979, in Southport, Queensland, he is a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP) and sits with the Liberal Party in federal parliament. Hamilton was elected in the 2020 Groom by-election, succeeding John McVeigh who retired from politics.

Hamilton was raised in Ipswich, where his father worked as a concreter, and his mother was a Hansard reporter in the Australian Parliament. He attended Ipswich Grammar School before studying engineering at the University of Queensland. He worked as an engineer on various large infrastructure projects around the world before leading research in the mining industry for CRC ORE.

Hamilton previously served as a campaign manager for the state MP for Toowoomba North, Trevor Watts, and wrote articles for The Spectator Australia, including an opinion column titled "Absent Fathers Matter," where he argued that social problems among Aboriginal Australians and African Americans such as incarceration rates would be alleviated if fathers were more present in the lives of their children.

In October 2020, Hamilton won the preselection for the Division of Groom after a contest between seven candidates triggered by John McVeigh's resignation from parliament. During the November 2020 by-election, Hamilton defeated three other candidates and was elected with a 3% swing against the LNP. He was sworn into the House of Representatives on December 3rd, 2020.

Hamilton has been an advocate for the delivery of the Inland Rail project, which he believes will bring significant economic benefits to the Toowoomba Region. He has also pushed for the inclusion of the Railway Parklands project in the South East Queensland City Deal, stating that it would help alleviate Toowoomba's housing crisis and increase foot traffic for city traders. Hamilton has been supportive of the proposed new dam at Emu Creek and was an early critic of the Queensland Government's handling of the Wellcamp Quarantine Facility.

In July 2022, Hamilton was appointed Deputy Chair of the House Standing Committee on Economics. He is reported to be a member of the "National Right" faction of the Liberal Party.

Hamilton currently resides in Toowoomba with his wife Louise and their three children, Adeline, Everard, and Claude. He is a volunteer firefighter.
