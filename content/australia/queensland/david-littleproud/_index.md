David Littleproud is an Australian politician who has been serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Division of Maranoa since 2016. He is a member of the Liberal National Party and sits with the National Party in federal parliament.

Born on 28 February 1976 in Chinchilla, Queensland, Littleproud grew up in a farming family and later pursued a career in agribusiness before entering politics. He attended boarding school in Toowoomba and later graduated with a Bachelor of Business from the University of Southern Queensland.

Prior to his political career, Littleproud held various positions in the agribusiness sector, including as a senior executive with the Australian Meat Holdings Group, as well as managing his family's beef cattle and cropping operations.

In 2016, Littleproud contested the federal election and was elected as the MP for the Division of Maranoa, which covers a large portion of rural Queensland. He was re-elected in the 2019 federal election, and in May 2019, was appointed as the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources in the Morrison government. In 2021, Littleproud was re-appointed as the Minister for Agriculture and Minister for Emergency Management.

Throughout his political career, Littleproud has been a vocal advocate for the agricultural sector and rural communities, and has championed issues such as drought support, water management, and trade relations.

Littleproud is married with three children and lives in Warwick, Queensland. In his spare time, he enjoys playing rugby league, coaching junior football, and spending time with his family.
