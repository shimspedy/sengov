Nita Louise Green is an Australian politician who was born on June 23, 1983, in Camperdown, New South Wales. She is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and was elected as a Senator for Queensland at the 2019 federal election, securing the first position on the ALP ticket. Green's mother, who was born in the United States, arrived in Australia at the age of nine and worked as a nurse while raising her as a single mother.

Green holds a Bachelor of Creative Arts from the University of Wollongong and a Juris Doctor from the University of Canberra. During her time at university, she worked in the retail and hospitality sectors. After being admitted as a solicitor in 2015, Green worked as an employment lawyer for Maurice Blackburn. In 2017, she became the Queensland field director for Australian Marriage Equality during the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. Later, she worked as an organizer for the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union and as a staffer for Senator Murray Watt.

In August 2018, Green won preselection for Labor's Senate ticket in Queensland, representing the Labor Left faction. At the time of her preselection, she was living on the Gold Coast, but she and her wife later relocated to Cairns so that her party would have a senator based in Far North Queensland.

Green is an advocate for transgender rights in sport and is a leader of the LGBTQ group Rainbow Labor. She believes that women who argue that women's sport should be reserved for cis women are transphobic and that such debates are incredibly hurtful for LGBT youth. On June 1, 2022, Green was appointed as Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
