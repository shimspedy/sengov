Aaron Violi is an Australian politician and the current Liberal Party member for the Division of Casey in Victoria. He succeeded Tony Smith in May 2022. Violi was born in Melbourne after his parents emigrated from Italy to Silvan, Victoria in 1953. He attended Yarra Glen Primary School and Mount Lilydale Mercy College. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree (with Honours) at La Trobe University before attaining a Masters of Business Administration (MBA) at Deakin University.

Prior to his political career, Violi worked for several well-known companies in the food and technology industries. He began his career in sales, leading the sales team at food manufacturer Yarra Valley Snack Foods for seven years before moving to Mars Australia. In 2019, he transitioned into the digital economy, taking up a role at a tech startup called Ritual.

Before running for parliament himself, Violi served as an adviser to Senator James Paterson. He was elected to represent Casey on 21 May 2022 with a margin of 1.5%.
