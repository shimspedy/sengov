Julian Christopher Hill is an Australian politician and member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), currently serving as the Member of Parliament for Bruce in the House of Representatives. Prior to his political career, Hill made a name for himself as a councilor and mayor of the City of Port Phillip, where he was the youngest councilor elected in 1999 and the youngest mayor elected in 2000. He served two terms as mayor from 2000 to 2002 and was re-elected as a councilor in 2002, serving until 2005.

In addition to his work as a councilor and mayor, Hill also worked in the Victorian Public Service under both Labor and Liberal governments. He is a graduate member of the Australian Institute of Company Directors and was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Public Administration Australia in 2012.

Hill is known for his advocacy on various issues, including drug use treatment and law reform, multiculturalism, and embracing diversity in all forms. As a Rainbow Labor member, Hill has been vocal about the importance of increasing diversity in parliament and is proud to see more LGBTI Australians in parliament than before.

Outside of his political and professional life, Hill has experienced personal loss and has spoken openly about his upbringing and family. He was raised by his mother after his father passed away when he was just four years old. Hill's mother, a nurse and midwife, instilled in him the values of responsibility, hard work, and compassion. Hill has also shared his experience of nursing his mother at home for 10 months before her death from an incurable cancer in 2008.

Hill is also the proud father of a daughter, Elanor. In 2017, Hill campaigned for changes to Australian prescription drug laws after Elanor was prescribed the oral contraceptive Diane-35 for acne treatment, which resulted in a 64cm blood clot.

Hill's advocacy and leadership have earned him the position of Deputy Chair of the Australian Parliament's Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, which oversees the Commonwealth Auditor-General, the Parliamentary Budget Office, and the Australian government's expenditure, performance, and financial statements. Hill's commitment to his constituents and the issues that matter to them has made him a respected and influential member of parliament.
