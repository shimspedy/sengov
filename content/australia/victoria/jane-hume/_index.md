Edwina Jane Hume, an Australian politician, has been serving as a senator for Victoria since 2016, representing the Liberal Party. From December 2020 to May 2022, she served as the Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services, and the Digital Economy in the Morrison Government, and in March 2021, she took on the additional responsibility of Minister for Women's Economic Security. Before her election to parliament, Hume held senior positions in the banking, finance, and superannuation sectors.

Hume was born on 30 April 1971, in Melbourne, and grew up in the suburb of Armadale. She attended Lauriston Girls' School and graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. She began her career at the National Australia Bank in 1995 as a sales and marketing research manager and worked there until 1999. Hume then joined Rothschild Australia as a senior business development manager in the asset management division. She left the workforce in 2002 to start a family, and from 2005 to 2006, she served on the management committee of Perinatal Anxiety & Depression Australia.

Hume joined the Liberal Party in 2003 and held senior positions in the party's Victorian Division, serving on the administrative committee, executive of the Women's Council, and as a delegate to state council. In March 2016, she won Liberal preselection for the Coalition's Senate ticket and was elected in fifth position on the Coalition ticket at the 2016 federal election. In May 2019, Hume was appointed Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services, and Financial Technology in the Morrison Government. Her title was later changed to Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services, and the Digital Economy as part of a December 2020 cabinet reshuffle. In March 2021, she was additionally appointed Minister for Women's Economic Security, a new position.

Hume reportedly holds socially liberal views and is a member of the Moderate/Modern Liberal faction of the Liberal Party. In May 2021, she stated her philosophy on regulating the cryptocurrency sector, arguing that it was up to Australian investors to judge for themselves whether to invest in higher-risk assets. She also expressed that she would not stand in the way of anyone who wanted to buy cryptocurrency. Hume supported a bill to repeal the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 in September 2022, which bars Australia's territory governments from legislating for assisted suicide, after previously being in favour of the ban.
