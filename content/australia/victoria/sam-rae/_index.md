Samuel Thomas Rae is an Australian politician who was born on September 26, 1986. He has made headlines due to his recent election as a member of the Australian House of Representatives for the new seat of Hawke during the 2022 Australian federal election. Before becoming a Member of Parliament, Rae worked as a state secretary for the Labor Party.

However, Rae faced controversy in March 2023, when he was accused of making a derogatory comment during a session of Parliament. It was alleged that he yelled, "at least I have my own children," at his Liberal opponent, Angie Bell, during her maiden speech. Bell is a member of the LGBTQ+ community and has four adult children with her partner Ros.

Rae has denied these accusations, but Bell filed a formal complaint about the incident. The situation has sparked a public debate about the use of personal attacks in politics and the need for respectful discourse in the Australian Parliament.
