Andrew James Giles is an Australian politician who has been a Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives since September 2013, representing the Division of Scullin, Victoria. He is currently the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs.

#### Early life and education

Giles was born in Melbourne, Victoria, on 31 July 1973. He attended Scotch College, Melbourne, and then studied law at the University of Melbourne, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts and Laws in 1996. After graduating, Giles worked as a principal solicitor for Slater and Gordon and as a senior associate at Holding Redlich lawyers and consultants. He also worked as a senior advisor for the Bracks and Brumby Governments in Victoria.

#### Political career

Giles was elected to parliament at the 2013 federal election, replacing the retiring Harry Jenkins in the Division of Scullin. He immediately took up a position as Labor's cities taskforce and has engaged in an Australia-wide cities listening tour. He is co-chair of Parliamentary friends of Amnesty International, and the deputy chair of the Parliament's Northern Europe group of its IPU members.

In 2016, Giles was elevated to the position of the Shadow Assistant Minister for Schools. In 2019, he became a member of Labor's Shadow Ministry, with portfolios including Multicultural Affairs, Cities and Urban Infrastructure, and Shadow Minister Assisting for Immigration and Citizenship. In this role, Giles led Labor's campaign to stop the Morrison Government's attempts to privatise Australia's visa system. He was also responsible for Labor's ‘reboot’ with multicultural communities, including the establishment of a Multicultural Caucus Committee to inform future policy development.

In 2022, Giles was appointed Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs in the Albanese Labor government.

#### Personal life

Giles is married to Dr Jillian Constable and they have two children. In the 1990s, he played guitar in an indie rock band called Ether, along with James Cecil, who went on to play in bands such as Architecture in Helsinki.

#### Political views

Giles is a self-described "progressive". He is a strong advocate for social justice, environmental protection, and peace. He is a critic of the Morrison Government's policies on climate change, asylum seekers, and Indigenous affairs. Giles is also a strong supporter of same-sex marriage and the introduction of a federal ICAC.

Giles' political views have been shaped by his personal experiences. He grew up in a working-class family and has seen firsthand the effects of poverty and inequality. He is also a passionate advocate for peace and has spoken out against war and violence.

Giles is a charismatic and articulate leader. He is a strong advocate for his beliefs and is not afraid to challenge the status quo. He is a rising star in Australian politics and is seen by many as a potential future leader of the country.
