Mark Alfred Dreyfus KC is a prominent Australian politician and lawyer, known for his distinguished career in law and public service. Born on October 3, 1956, in Perth, Western Australia, Dreyfus is the son of renowned composer George Dreyfus, who immigrated to Australia from Nazi Germany. He received his education from Scotch College, Melbourne, on a full scholarship, and went on to graduate from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws.

Before entering politics, Dreyfus built a highly successful career as a barrister, specializing in constitutional, commercial, and environmental law. He represented several high-profile cases, including the leading implied freedom of political communication cases of Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd (1994) and Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997), and represented Michael Danby in a defamation suit against the LaRouche movement. In 1999, he was appointed Queen's Counsel, a prestigious title bestowed on lawyers for outstanding service to the legal profession.

Throughout his legal career, Dreyfus was actively involved in various professional organizations, serving as a director of the Law Council of Australia, on the Victorian Bar Council, and the Victorian Bar Ethics Committee. He was also committed to working closely with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory, including representing a number of claimants in the landmark Stolen Generations litigation.

In 2007, Dreyfus transitioned from a career in law to politics, winning the seat of Isaacs in the federal election. He was appointed to the Cabinet in September 2010 by then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard, serving as Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. He went on to hold additional responsibilities as Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation.

In February 2013, following the resignation of Nicola Roxon, Dreyfus was appointed Attorney-General for the first time in the Rudd-Gillard government. He continued in this role after Kevin Rudd replaced Gillard as Prime Minister in June 2013, serving as Attorney-General, Special Minister of State, and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity. However, Labor was defeated in the 2013 election, and Dreyfus returned to serving as a shadow attorney-general for the following nine years.

Following Labor's victory in the 2022 federal election, Dreyfus was appointed Attorney-General and Cabinet Secretary for the second time in the Albanese Government. During his second tenure as attorney-general, he has been instrumental in introducing a national anti-corruption commission, abolishing the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), and initiating a royal commission regarding the unlawful Robodebt scheme. He ordered the discontinuation of the prosecution of whistleblower Bernard Collaery and pledged reform to the Privacy Act in response to several high-profile data breaches that have taken place in Australia.

Dreyfus is a member of Labor's right faction, advocating strongly for action on climate change and the establishment of a federal anti-corruption agency. He was a vocal supporter of the 'yes' campaign during the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey and a vocal opponent against funding reductions to climate science research at the CSIRO during the Abbott government era.

Overall, Mark Dreyfus is a highly respected figure in Australian public life, known for his strong commitment to the rule of law, justice, and social progress.
