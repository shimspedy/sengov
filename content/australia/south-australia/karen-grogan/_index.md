Karen Grogan is a prominent Australian politician who has been serving as a Senator for South Australia since 21 September 2021. She was appointed to fill a casual vacancy that was caused by the death of Alex Gallacher.

Grogan was born in London, England, to Irish parents, and her father, Larry Grogan, was a shop steward with the Transport and General Workers' Union. In 1990, she moved to Australia and became an Australian citizen four years later.

Before joining politics, Grogan served as the CEO of the South Australian Council of Social Service (SACOSS) until 2009. She then worked as the chief of staff to Mark Butler, the federal MP for Hindmarsh. In 2019, Grogan joined the United Voice trade union as a senior political officer. After the merger of United Voice and the National Union of Workers, forming the United Workers Union (UWU), Grogan succeeded David Gray as the convenor of the PLUS (Progressive Left Unions and Sub-branches) faction.

Grogan's vast experience in social service and trade unionism has equipped her with a unique perspective and skill set, which she brings to the table as a Senator for South Australia.

#### Time is running out to save our River Murray.
For decades, too much water has been taken out of the river upstream - leaving precious little by the time it flows down to South Australia.

We rely on the Murray for drinking water, for agriculture, for industry, for tourism, and for so much more.

The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was supposed to ensure South Australia got enough water to keep the Murray alive. But too much of the plan hasn’t been implemented, and the water we were promised hasn’t been delivered.

#### As a Senator for SA, I’m determined to be a voice for all South Australians.
I’m proud to be Labor’s Duty Senator for Grey - a Labor voice in the huge electorate that covers 92% of South Australia.

Across the Eyre Peninsula, on the Upper Spencer Gulf, in the far north, on the Yorke Peninsula, and everywhere in between, I’m determined to fight for a fair go for regional SA.

#### I’ve spent my life supporting working people - especially those in low-paid or insecure work. 
Every Australian should have access to a good, secure job. No worker should struggle to put food on the table or support their family. 

I’m fighting for secure jobs, for a fair day’s pay, and for strong workplace rights. Working Australians deserve no less.

#### Shortages of GPs and other health services in regional SA are at crisis levels.
For too long, rural and regional areas have struggled to attract the medical professionals they need. 

This isn’t just an inconvenience - this crisis is having real and serious impacts on people’s health.

I’m committed to ensuring your experiences are heard, and to finding solutions to this crisis.
