Steven Georganas is an Australian politician and a member of the Australian Labor Party. He was born on June 13, 1959, in Adelaide to Greek parents. Georganas attended a TAFE college and gained a Business Studies Certificate before starting his career as a taxi driver, factory worker, and underwriter. In 2002, he worked as a ministerial adviser to South Australian government minister Jay Weatherill.

Georganas began his political career as a candidate for the Labor Party in the federal elections for Hindmarsh in 1998 and 2001, but was unsuccessful on both occasions. However, he won the seat in the 2004 federal election, defeating the Liberal candidate Simon Birmingham by a narrow margin of 108 votes. Georganas won re-election with increased majorities in 2007 and 2010, but was defeated by Liberal candidate Matt Williams in the 2013 federal election. He regained his seat in Hindmarsh in the 2016 federal election.

In the lead-up to the 2019 federal election, a redistribution of seats saw the abolition of the neighboring Port Adelaide seat, resulting in its territory being transferred to Hindmarsh. As part of a deal between the Left and Right factions of the Labor Party in South Australia, Georganas gave up his seat in Hindmarsh to the incumbent MP for Port Adelaide, Mark Butler, and won the preselection for Adelaide, after the incumbent MP Kate Ellis announced her retirement. Georganas won the seat of Adelaide at the 2019 federal election with a nominal majority of 9 percent.

Throughout his political career, Georganas has advocated for noise reduction around the Adelaide Airport and introduced a Private member's bill to create an Aircraft Noise Ombudsman in 2007. He has been a vocal supporter of animal welfare and has campaigned against live animal exports and for the banning of the super-trawler FV Margiris from fishing in Australia. Georganas also voted in support of same-sex marriage in Australia when the issue was debated in parliament in 2013. He introduced a Private member's bill in 2012 to create a 'Do Not Knock' register to ban door-to-door salespeople from visiting registered properties.

Georganas has been involved in several community organizations, including serving as president of his local Lions club and as a board member of the Adelaide Greek Glendi Festival. He has also been a supporter of the West Adelaide Football Club and served as a member of the club's board of directors. Georganas has two adult sons, George and Alex, and has lived his entire life in the Mile End suburb of Adelaide. In May 2019, he left the Labor Left faction to join Labor Unity.
