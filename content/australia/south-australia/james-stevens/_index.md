James William Stevens is an Australian politician and current member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Sturt in South Australia. He was born on 27 March 1983 in Rose Park, South Australia. Stevens completed his education at St Peters College, Adelaide, and went on to earn a Bachelor of Commerce and a Master of International Trade and Development from the University of Adelaide.

Before entering politics, Stevens held various positions at Michell Wool, including Commercial Manager and General Manager. He then became involved in politics, serving as the President of the South Australian Young Liberal Movement from 2004 to 2006. He also served as the Campaign Coordinator for the South Australian Liberal Party from 2006 to 2008.

Stevens later became involved in the leadership of the parliamentary Liberal Party of South Australia, serving as the chief of staff from 2013 to 2018. He was appointed as the chief of staff to the Premier of South Australia, Steven Marshall, from 2018 to 2019, where he oversaw the party's adoption of data mining software in the lead-up to the 2018 South Australian state election.

In 2019, Stevens was elected to the House of Representatives for Sturt, replacing the retiring Liberal member Christopher Pyne. Stevens is a member of the Moderate faction of the Liberal Party.

Stevens has received recognition for his political work, being named one of the 50 Most Influential South Australians by The Advertiser newspaper in June 2013.

Stevens is dating Alex May, the current State Director of the Liberal Party in South Australia and former Deputy Chief of Staff to Premier Steven Marshall. In 2022, Stevens made headlines after falling asleep in his office and missing a vote on the Religious Discrimination Bill. He denied allegations that he had soiled himself during the incident. At the 2022 Federal Election, Stevens suffered a swing of 7.4% against him but managed to retain his seat by a slim margin of 0.5%.
