Louise Jane Miller-Frost is an Australian politician who was elected to represent the division of Boothby in the 2022 Australian federal election as a member of the Australian Labor Party. She was born in Hollywood, Worcestershire, England, and migrated to Adelaide, Australia, with her family when she was 18 months old. Miller-Frost completed an undergraduate degree in Applied Science and postgraduate degrees in Arts, Business Administration, and Public Health at various universities in South Australia. She has had an extensive career as an executive in several organizations, including SA Health, City of Port Adelaide Enfield, and Catherine House Inc. She was appointed Chief Executive of St Vincent de Paul Society SA in March 2020, but the organization lost funding from the South Australian government in May 2021 due to a change in the funding model for homeless accommodation providers. Miller-Frost has also served on several boards, including the Medical Board of Australia, Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, and Animal Welfare League SA.

Miller-Frost was preselected by the Australian Labor Party to run for Parliament in the seat of Boothby in the 2022 federal election and won, defeating her opponents from the Liberal Party and an independent candidate. She has expressed support for meaningful action on climate change, a federal ICAC, and more social housing in South Australia. Miller-Frost lives in Cumberland Park, South Australia, with her husband and has three sons and three stepsons.
