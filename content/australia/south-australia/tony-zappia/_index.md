Antonio Zappia is an Australian politician and former powerlifting champion, known for his remarkable achievements both in and out of the political arena. Born on June 13, 1952, Zappia attended Pooraka Primary School and Enfield High School before embarking on a career in banking with ANZ Bank in 1969.

In 1976, Zappia was offered the position of research officer to Senator Jim Cavanagh, where he quickly proved himself to be a valuable asset to the team. Zappia's interest in fitness and weightlifting led him to open three fitness centers, where he also gained recognition as a ten-time National Champion in powerlifting.

However, it was Zappia's foray into politics that would bring him to national attention. In 1997, he was elected as Mayor of the City of Salisbury, where he served for an impressive ten years until 2007. Zappia's dedication to public service and community engagement continued to grow, culminating in his successful bid for the House of Representatives seat of Makin in South Australia in the 2007 election, as a member of the Australian Labor Party.

Zappia's election victory was particularly significant as he defeated the incumbent Liberal candidate Bob Day in a marginal seat that had always been held by the party of government. In a stunning achievement, Zappia secured a 57.7 percent two-party vote, with an 8.6-point two-party swing. His victory was the largest two-party vote and swing of any party in Makin's history at the time, and the first time a Makin candidate had won a majority of the primary vote.

Zappia's success continued at subsequent elections, where he secured an even larger two-party vote in 2010, making Makin a safe Labor seat. Although he experienced a reduction in his two-party vote in the 2013 election, Zappia still managed to hold on to the seat with a 55.1 percent two-party vote. This achievement made him the first opposition member in Makin's history.

Despite his many accomplishments, Zappia remains a grounded and humble individual who is deeply committed to his family. He lives in Pooraka with his wife Vicki and their three children, who continue to provide him with the inspiration and support he needs to pursue his political and personal goals.
