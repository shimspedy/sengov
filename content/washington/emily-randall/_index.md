Born and raised in Washington’s 6th Congressional District, Emily Randall is the proud product of a union, working-class family–like many in the 6th District. 

Emily is fueled by her family’s experiences. When her sister Olivia, born with complex disabilities, received access to newly expanded Medicaid, Emily became a fierce advocate for quality, affordable healthcare. And as the first in her family to attend a four-year college, Emily knows the importance of education that aligns with the community’s needs and leads to family-wage jobs. 

Emily’s legislative track record proves she doesn’t just talk the talk, she gets results and wins the toughest races. In 2018 and 2022, Emily won the most competitive state senate district in Washington by focusing on the most important issues and her track record of success.

In Congress, Emily will fight for affordable and accessible healthcare, including reproductive freedom for all; common-sense gun reform; a just transition to a green economy; and affordable education, job training, and apprenticeship programs. Emily’s ready to go beyond partisan politics and focus on the practical solutions that address the dynamic needs of the 6th District.
