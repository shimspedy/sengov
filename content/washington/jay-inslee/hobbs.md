#### About Secretary of State Steve Hobbs

Steve Hobbs is Washington’s 16th Secretary of State. He was appointed by Gov. Jay Inslee to replace Kim Wyman, who resigned mid-term to join the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Secretary Hobbs began his tenure Nov. 22, 2021.

As head of one of the most diverse offices in state government, Secretary Hobbs is responsible for managing state and local elections, corporation and charity filings, Washington State Library, Washington Talking Book & Braille Library, and Washington State Archives. In addition, his office oversees the Combined Fund Drive for charitable giving by state employees, and administers the state’s Address Confidentiality Program to help protect survivors of crime.

Prior to his appointment as Secretary of State, Hobbs was the state senator for Washington’s 44th legislative district, having first been elected in 2006. During his tenure he served as chair of the Transportation Committee, and was a member of the Business, Financial Services & Trade; and Environment, Energy & Technology committees.


As state senator, Hobbs adopted an expansive policy agenda that included local job creation through helping small businesses and improving transportation infrastructure. He promoted legislation to enhance state government accountability, and worked with the community to create new and innovative approaches to strengthening education. He particularly focused on expanding high-school and college programs that prepare students for the growing demand in the high-tech industry locally and globally.

Secretary Hobbs is a lieutenant colonel in the Washington Army National Guard and proudly served in Kosovo and Iraq. In 2020, he was mobilized to command 750 service members during Washington’s COVID-19 response. Hobbs was responsible for all Guard personnel located at Western Washington food banks from Skagit County to Pierce County. As state senator, he continually advocated for Washington state’s service members and their families by drafting policies that recognize the complex needs of men and women in the military. He worked with service members statewide to develop legislation ranging from help in education, finding good family wage jobs, and protecting veterans’ rights.
