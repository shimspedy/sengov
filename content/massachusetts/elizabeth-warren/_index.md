Senator Elizabeth Ann Warren is an American legal scholar and politician. She is serving as a senior U.S. Senator for Massachusetts under the Democrats since 2013

Warren was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on June 22, 1949. Born to a middle-class family, Warren lived in Norman until 11 years old, when she moved to Oklahoma City.

But, her family’s financial status worsened after her father had a heart attack. Then, she started working as a waiter at 13. Luckily, she won a scholarship to George Washington University in 1965. But, she dropped out to marry in 1968.

She later enrolled at the University of Houston. There, she received a Bachelor’s degree in speech pathology and audiology.

Yet, Warren and her husband moved to New Jersey after a job transfer. There, she studied at Rutgers University’s School of Law. She graduated with a J.D. in 1976. After her J.D., she practiced law from her home.
