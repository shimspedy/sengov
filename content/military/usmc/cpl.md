A Corporal in the Marine Corps is a junior noncommissioned officer, and is equivalent in rank to the Army's junior NCO ranks of Corporal and Specialist. Corporals usually command small contingents of Marines in combat and operations, including four-man fireteams (which may also be lead by a Lance Corporal) or eight-man squads comprising of two fireteams.

The Marine Corps specializes in small-unit operations, and as a result Corporals hold a significant amount of authority and resposibility in contrast to the lighter duties of Lance Corporals and Privates. Because of the responsibilities delegated to squad and fireteam leaders, promotion to Corporal is seen as a very significant accomplishment for an enlisted Marine.

Promotion to Corporal is awarded on a rolling basis to experienced soldiers who achieve a qualifying composite or cutting score in a variety of assessments.

Corporal is the 4th rank in the United States Marine Corps , ranking above Lance Corporal and directly below Sergeant. A corporal is a Noncommissioned Officer at DoD paygrade E-4, with a starting monthly pay of $2,393.

### How do you become a Corporal?
A Corporal is most often promoted from Lance Corporal (LCpl), although promotion from lower paygrades may occur with sufficient display of leadership and experience.

### What are a Corporal Responsibilities?
Corporal is the fourth among Enlisted ranks in the USMC. It is the first Non-Commissioned Officer rank, with the expectations of leading and setting expectations for junior Enlisted Marines. It is rare to see a group of junior Enlisted Marines without a Corporal or higher ranking Marine to supervise them.

Corporals are often Squad Leaders, leading two Fire Teams of four Marines each. Corporals continue developing their own skills through schools, self-education, strict self-discipline, and mentorship from higher-ranking Marines. Learning never stops, especially if Marines are intent on making the military a career.
