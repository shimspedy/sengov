Lance Corporal is the third enlisted rank in the Marine Corps, equivalent to a Private First Class in the Army. Unlike the rank of Corporal, a Lance Corporal is not considered a non-commissioned officer. However, Marines promoted to this rank are expected to show a degree of leadership and skill in serving as role models for newly enlisted recruits.

While the Army temporarily had Lance Corporals in the 1960s, the Marine Corps is currently the only branch of the armed forces that maintains this rank.

Marines generally receive a promotion to Lance Corporal after one or more years of service. Once the rank of Lance Corporal has been achieved, they may qualify for promotion to Corporal by receiving a qualifying score on a composite skills and leadership assessment.

Lance Corporal is the 3rd rank in the United States Marine Corps , ranking above Private First Class and directly below Corporal. A lance corporal is a Junior Enlisted at DoD paygrade E-3, with a starting monthly pay of $2,161.

### How do you become a Lance Corporal?
A Lance Corporal is most often promoted from Private First Class (PFC), although promotion from lower paygrades may occur with sufficient display of leadership and experience.

If the Marine entered the Navy as an E-2, then they are all but guaranteed to promote to E-3 after nine months. Only an official record of bad behavior will hamper this. Alternately, the Marine may have graduated Recruit Training and immediately promoted to E-3 based on their initial signing contract and performance.

### What are a Lance Corporal Responsibilities?
Lance Corporal is the third-lowest among Enlisted ranks in the USMC. Most E-3s have already arrived to the Fleet; others highly technical ratings might continue training.

Fleet E-3s are more likely to know their way around than E-1s and E-2s. Experience and knowledge give a Marine much more credit than rank does. Fleet E-3s must begin competing for promotion to NCO status, which means they need to work on self-education courses, take on collateral duties (such as Fire Team Leader), and demonstrate leadership. Some Marines may hopelessly spend their entire commitment to the Marines as E-3s and never promote to E-4, thereby leaving as "Terminal Lances".
