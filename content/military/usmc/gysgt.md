A Gunnery Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps is a specialized non-commissioned officer who manages firepower and logistics for a company-sized unit of Marines.

The rank of Gunnery Sergeant is unique to the Marine Corps, and was introduced in the 19th century. While serving aboard Navy vessels, Marine contingents were expected to help man the ship's weapons in gun crews of four to five marines. The leader of each gun crew was a specialized Marine who trained his gun crew in firing procedure, ammunition handling, and other essential skills. Recognizing the importance of this position, the rank of Gunnery sergeant was introduced and made permanent in 1899.

Today, Gunnery Sergeants in the Marine Corps infantry forces serve as fire and operations chief for a full company of 180+ marines. During company operations the company Gunnery sergeant coordinates weapons and indirect fire, manages firepower logistics, and works with the Company Commander on logistics and company operations strategy.

Promotion to Gunnery Sergeant requires a great deal of leadership skill and an excellent command of specialized knowledge of weapons systems and combat logistics. Junior Gunnery Sergeants may serve with smaller units of Marines then their more experienced peers, such as a weapons platoon of 30 Marines.

In many marine units, the Gunnery Sergeant is known informally by the nickname "Gunny" by his peers and superiors. Some Gunnery Sergeants may also welcome use of the nickname by their subordinates as well.

Gunnery Sergeant is the 7th rank in the United States Marine Corps , ranking above Staff Sergeant and directly below Master Sergeant. A gunnery sergeant is a Staff Noncommissioned Officer at DoD paygrade E-7, with a starting monthly pay of $3,294.

### How do you become a Gunnery Sergeant?
A Gunnery Sergeant is most often promoted from Staff Sergeant (SSgt), although promotion from lower paygrades may occur with sufficient display of leadership and experience. 

### What are a Gunnery Sergeant's Responsibilities?
Gunnery Sergeant is the seventh among Enlisted ranks in the USMC. It is the second Staff Non-Commissioned Officer rank, with the clearest distinction of being someone never to piss off. Marine Gunnery Sergeants are often famously portrayed in movies as Drill Instructors -- with such adaptations almost always far tamer than real life.

Gunnery Sergeants usually lead at the Company level, advising Captains on material and personnel readiness. They may serve on Battalion-level staffs, or may be in charge of training units or recruiting stations in the absence of an Officer to fill the billet. Their growth in technical and interpersonal leadership continues.
