Private is the entry-level rank in the Marine Corps. Unlike the next paygrade of Private First Class, Marine Corps privates wear no rank insignia. Most enlisted Marines begin service as an E-1 Private in Basic Training, and usually receive a promotion to Private First Class after serving for a specified amount of time.

Because their uniforms have a plain black area instead of a rank insignia, privates in the Marine Corps are often informally referred to as "slick sleeves" or "fuzzies" by more experinced marines.

Private is the 1st rank in the United States Marine Corps . A private is a Junior Enlisted at DoD paygrade E-1, with a starting monthly pay of $1,833.

### What are a Private's Responsibilities?
Private is the lowest among Enlisted ranks in the USMC. Privates are universally known as "boots" for having recently graduated "Boot Camp" and still knowing nothing about the Fleet.

After Recruit Training, all Privates attend a School of Infantry (SOI) and learn how to be a Rifleman. Marines with Infantry MOSs go to an Infantry Training Battalion, and all others go to Marine Combat Training and then another school for their MOS. After that, the Private will finally report to their first unit.

No matter which MOS they are, Privates can expect to perform lots of cleaning and very basic guard duty.

###  Marine Corps Promotion to E-1 Private
To reach the rank of E-1, all Marines must complete Recruit Training, or "Boot Camp", which lasts 13 weeks in either Parris Island, SC, or San Diego, CA. Until graduation, they are Recruits and essentially E-"nothings".

Upon graduation, Marines may be promoted to E-1, E-2, or E-3 depending on several factors. College credits or positive referrals to recruiters can result in automatic promotion. If the Marine was a meritorious JROTC Cadet, Sea Cadet, Young Marine, or Boy or Girl Scout, this may also warrant immediate promotions as put in writing by their recruiters. A Marine may also receive an immediate promotion for being the "honor graduate" of their Recruit Training class.

There are over a dozen ways to immediately promote past E-1 after Basic Training. Speak with a USMC Recruiter for more details. And remember, in the military, nothing is guaranteed unless it is in writing.

### History of the Marine Corps Private Rank
A Private is a Junior Enlisted in the United States Marine Corps at DoD paygrade E-1.

"Private" comes from the medieval "Private Soldier" who either volunteered or was conscripted to go to war, lead by a feudal lord or nobleman. The rank has been in use by the US Army and Marines since their inception.
