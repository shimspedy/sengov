First Sergeant is a senior non-commissioned officer's rank in the United States Marine Corps. A First Sergeant shares the E-8 paygrade with Master Sergeant, although the two ranks have separate spheres of responsibility.

A First Sergeant serves as the senior enlisted advisor to the commander of a medium-to-large unit of Marines, such as a platoon or a company. As the senior enlisted advisor, First Sergeants hold the responsiobility of being the main bridge between enlisted Marines and their company commander. In this position, they serve as advocates for their Marines to the command hierarchy and assist in leading tactical and training operations.

To get promoted to First Sergeant, a Marine (generally holding the rank of Gunnery Sergeant) must receive an outstanding Fitrep (fitness report) from their commanding officer and successfully meet a series of experience and leadership requirements. Before beginning the promotion qualification rounds, the candidate will choose their desired track for promotion - First Sergeant for Marines interested in command responsibility, and Master Sergeant for those interested in technical and operations management.

For First Sergeants continuing on the command track, the next promotable rank is Sergeant Major. The equivalent rank to First Sergeant was established by the Marine Corps back in 1833, and given its modern title in 1872.

Master Sergeant is the 8th rank in the United States Marine Corps , ranking above Gunnery Sergeant and directly below First Sergeant. A master sergeant is a Staff Noncommissioned Officer at DoD paygrade E-8, with a starting monthly pay of $4,739.

### How do you become a Master Sergeant?
A Master Sergeant is most often promoted from Gunnery Sergeant (GySgt), although promotion from lower paygrades may occur with sufficient display of leadership and experience. 

### What are a Master Sergeant Responsibilities?
Master Sergeant is the eighth among Enlisted ranks in the USMC, equal in rank but different in responsibilities than a First Sergeant. Master Sergeants are technical managers, while First Sergeants are personnel managers.

Master Sergeants may serve on Battalion, Regiment, or Brigade level staffs, advising Majors or Lieutenant Colonels of the readiness of their units with respect to equipment and programs.
