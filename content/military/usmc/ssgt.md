Staff Sergeant is the first of the staff non-commissioned officer ranks in the United States Marine Corps. Generally experienced Marines with 10 to 13 years of service, Staff Sergeants most often serve as a platoon sergeant for a platoon consisting of 30 or more Marines.

As a platoon sergeant, Staff Sergeants may act as the top tactical advisor to their platoon commander during combat and support operations. In day-to-day deployment and training, a staff sergeant will also assist with training and administrative operation of his platoon.

The rank of Staff Sergeant, like several other modern Marine Corps ranks, was introduced by the USMC in 1923 in order to match the rank structure used by the U.S. Army.

Staff Sergeant is the 6th rank in the United States Marine Corps , ranking above Sergeant and directly below Gunnery Sergeant. A staff sergeant is a Staff Noncommissioned Officer at DoD paygrade E-6, with a starting monthly pay of $2,849. 

### How do you become a Staff Sergeant?
A Staff Sergeant is most often promoted from Sergeant (Sgt), although promotion from lower paygrades may occur with sufficient display of leadership and experience.

### What are a Staff Sergeant's Responsibilities?
Staff Sergeant is the sixth among Enlisted ranks in the USMC. It is the first Staff Non-Commissioned Officer rank, with the clear distinction of being both a career Marine and someone never to piss off.

Staff Sergeants are usually Platoon Sergeants in charge of 40-50 Marines. They must recognize the Marines with the most potential and help them get promoted, and spend extra dedication aiding Marines who struggle at their jobs. One primary duty for Staff Sergeants is training Junior Officers, who might be mature enough to have graduated college, but know nothing about the Fleet. Being a Staff Sergeant means the Corps is your life, and your mastery of interpersonal and technical skills must keep increasing.

Only the most elite are chosen to become Drill Instructors, enduring hell in order to earn their dreaded "green belts", or even their master "black belts".
