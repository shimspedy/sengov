Private First Class is the second-lowest rank in the Marine Corps, ranking above Private and below Lance Corporal. A Private First Class in the Marines is equivalent in paygrade to a Private (PV2) in the Army, and is a full paygrade lower then an Army Private First Class because the Marine Corps only has one Private paygrade instead of the Army's two.

The rank of Private First Class was introduced by the Marine Corps following service in WWI in 1917 to mirror the Army's rank structure. Like their Army counterparts, a PFC in the Marines is expected to serve as a model for newly-enlisted troops and carry out the orders of their superior officers to the best of their abilities.

Private First Class is the 2nd rank in the United States Marine Corps , ranking above Private and directly below Lance Corporal. A private first class is a Junior Enlisted at DoD paygrade E-2, with a starting monthly pay of $2,055.

### How do you become a Private First Class?
A Private First Class is most often promoted from Private (Pvt), although promotion from lower paygrades may occur with sufficient display of leadership and experience.

If the Marine joined the Corps as an E-1, then they are all but guaranteed to promote to E-2 after six months. Only an official record of bad behavior will hamper this. Alternately, the Marine may have graduated Recruit Training and immediately promoted to E-2 based on their initial signing contract and performance.

### What are a Private First Class Responsibilities?
PFC is the second-lowest among Enlisted ranks in the USMC. There is not much difference between the lives of an E-1 or E-2. They may be in school or in the Fleet; but no matter what, most of their time is divided between studying and menial labor.
