Sergeant Major is the highest enlisted rank in the Marine Corps, and is equivalent in paygrade (but not in responsibility) to Master Gunnery Sergeant.

A Sergeant Major serves as the billeted senior enlisted advisor for the Marine Corps' largest units, including battalions and squadrons. As the senior enlisted member of their unit, Sergeant Majors serve as a bridge between the enlisted Marines and their commanders and assist in unit logistics, drilling, and disciplinary actions among their Marines.

Sergeant Major is the highest enlisted rank available to non-commissioned officers following the command career path. Most Sergeant Majors are promoted from the ranks of qualifying First Sergeants, who serve a similar purpose in smaller units such as companies and platoons.

Master Gunnery Sergeant is the 10th rank in the United States Marine Corps , ranking above First Sergeant and directly below Sergeant Major. A master gunnery sergeant is a Staff Noncommissioned Officer at DoD paygrade E-9, with a starting monthly pay of $5,789.

### How do you become a Master Gunnery Sergeant?
