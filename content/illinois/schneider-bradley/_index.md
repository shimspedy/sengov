Brad Schneider represents Illinois’s 10th District in the United States House of Representatives, where he is serving his fourth term. He is a member of the House Committee on Ways and Means and House Committee on Foreign Affairs. He has previously served on the House Judiciary and Small Business committees.

As a member of Congress, Brad is focused on building a thriving economy that works for all Americans, and ensuring every family has affordable health care, quality education and a rising standard of living.  He knows that our communities are stronger when small businesses invest and grow, our environment is healthy, and people are working together for a better future. 

Brad is committed to tackling the challenges we face as a nation, including protecting Medicare and Social Security for future generations, reforming our broken immigration system,  passing sensible gun safety legislation, and critically, urgently taking action to reduce the rate and address the impacts of global climate change. 

He is also a staunch advocate for the rights of women, including ensuring equal pay for equal work and protecting every woman’s right to make her own health care decisions about her body. Brad also favors extending federal civil rights protections to the LGBTQ community and was a strong supporter of marriage equality long before he held public office.

Brad remains an influential voice on foreign affairs in Congress and believes our nation and world benefit when the United States exercises leadership and engages with the international community. A longtime proponent of a strong U.S.-Israel relationship, Brad consistently leads on efforts in Congress to promote cooperation on security, counter Iran’s nefarious influence, and condemn efforts to delegitimize the Jewish state.

Prior to being elected to Congress, Brad spent more than 20 years in business and management consulting, helping both large and family-owned businesses address the challenges of a changing economy and plan for the future.  His professional experience has allowed him to see first-hand the challenges small businesses face when trying to hire new workers and grow their company, as well as the effect thriving small businesses can have on a community’s overall well-being.

At home, Brad has deep ties to the community, including service with organizations such as the Jewish United Fund, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Waukegan Public Library Foundation, B.E.S.T., the Coalition to Reduce Recidivism, and the Civic Leadership Foundation.

Brad earned a BS in industrial engineering and his MBA from Northwestern University.

Brad and his wife, Julie, have been residents of the Tenth District for 30 years, where they created a home, built their careers, and, most importantly, raised two sons, Adam and Daniel.

He now enjoys exploring the bike trails throughout the district.
