Congresswoman Mary Miller represents the 15th District of Illinois in the United States House of Representatives, where she serves on the Agriculture Committee and Education & Labor Committee. Mary is a proud member of the House Freedom Caucus and Republican Study Committee, where she fights for conservative, Constitutional principles including the Right to Life, the Second Amendment, and ballot security.

Mary is a wife, mother, grandmother, and local farmer who serves as a voice for families and farmers ignored by D.C. insiders in the swamp.

On the House Agriculture Committee, Mary worked with both parties to pass rural broadband legislation, fund vital crop insurance programs, and allow milk back into the school lunch program. She has also introduced legislation to stop the Biden EPA from infringing on farmers and ranchers with burdensome Waters of the United States (WOTUS) regulations.

On the House Education & Labor Committee, Mary stood up to the Biden Administration's attempts to push Critical Race Theory and extremist indoctrination in our public schools. Mary also advocates for small businesses in downstate Illinois who are being crushed by harmful labor regulations from the Biden Administration that are forcing our jobs overseas.

Mary graduated from Eastern Illinois University with a B.S. in Business Management and completed graduate coursework in education. She received her teaching certification from the State of Illinois. Mary and her husband Chris raised a family on a budget and have run their Oakland-based family farm for the last forty years.

In her spare time, Mary teaches Sunday School and Vacation Bible School. Mary and Chris attend Oakland Christian Church in Oakland, Illinois, and they have seven children and seventeen grandchildren.
