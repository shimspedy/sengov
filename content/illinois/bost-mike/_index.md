Rep. Mike Bost is proud to represent the 12 counties of Illinois’ 12th District in the U.S. House of Representatives.  Sworn into office on January 6, 2015, Mike is continuing the fight for our Southern Illinois’ values in Washington – a fight he began in U.S. military, then as a first responder, a local job creator, and a state representative.

In the 117th Congress, Rep. Bost serves on two key committees: Veterans’ Affairs, and Transportation & Infrastructure.  On the Veterans' Affairs Committee he serves as the Ranking Member, the top Republican on the Committee.

Prior to his election to Congress, Rep. Bost served for two decades in the Illinois House of Representatives, rising to the leadership position of House Republican Caucus Chair.

Rep. Bost also served as a firefighter for the Murphysboro Fire Department.   He graduated from the University of Illinois' Certified Firefighter II Academy in 1993 and continued to serve the Murphysboro Fire Department during his six terms as state representative.  Prior to that, Rep. Bost worked for 13 years at Bost Trucking Service, first as a driver and then for 10 years as a truck manager.

Rep. Bost is a lifelong resident of Murphysboro.  He graduated from Murphysboro High School in 1979.   After high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps serving his country from 1979 to 1982.   He was trained as an electronic specialist and radar repairman and received an honorable discharge as a Corporal E-4. 

In addition to his duties as a Member of Congress, Rep. Bost is very active in his church and community.   Rep. Bost and his wife, Tracy, own and operate a small business – the White House Salon – in Murphysboro.

Mike and Tracy have three children – Steven, Kasey Fred and Kaitlin Rose.  They have two sons-in-law, Travis Fred and Chad Rose, a daughter-in-law, Betsy, and eleven grandchildren.
