Senator Thomas Jonathan Ossoff is an American journalist and politician. He is serving as a senior U.S. Senator from Georgia under the Democrats since 2021.

Ossoff was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 16, 1987. This makes him one of the youngest senators in the history of the United States Senate.

He attended an independent high school in Atlanta. There, he interned for U.S. Representative John Lewis. In 2009, Ossoff graduated with a B.A. degree at Georgetown University. In 2013, he also earned a Master’s degree in International Political Economy from the London School of Economics.

Ossoff worked as national security staff and legislative assistant for U.S. Rep Hank Johnson from 2007 to 2012.

Senator Jon Ossoff also worked as the managing director and CEO of Insight TWI. The company works with reporters to create corruption and scandal documentaries. His firm produces investigations and documentaries about war crimes.

#### Senator Jon Ossoff Career

Senator Jon Ossoff started his political career in 2017. Then, he announced his candidacy for a vacant position at the U.S. House of Reps. Republican Tom Price vacated the seat after his appointment as the Secretary of Health and Human Sciences.

Fortunately, many members of Congress and Democratic leaders endorsed him. In fact, Ossoff realized more than $55 million from fundraising nationwide. But, he dropped out of the race before the general election in 2018.

Yet, in 2020 Senator Jon Ossoff stepped out as a Democrat candidate for a seat at the U.S. Senate. He won Democrat’s primaries and looked to unseat incumbent David Perdue at the general election. On January 6, 2021, Ossoff was declared the winner and was sworn into office the same month.

During his time at the Senate, Ossoff had progressive positions in women’s issues. He has also worked to improve the general healthcare of his state.

He worked to bolster economic development in the state. He supported increasing financial relief for businesses and households during the COVID pandemic. He also supported free basic healthcare to sustain people during the pandemic.

#### Senator Jon Ossoff Criticisms

Ossoff got under fire after Perdue uncovered his alleged affiliation with the Communist Party and the Chinese Government. Although Ossoff had business ties with a Chinese company, Perdue claimed their transaction was strictly for business.

Contrary to Ossoff’s claim of endorsement from the two groups, the company only paid for licensing a documentary instead of a donation fund which Ossoff claimed.

Ossoff was part of the Senators that voted for the conviction and impeachment of President Trump after the January 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
