Representative Lucy McBath is a mom, a wife, an author, and an advocate. On Black Friday in 2012, her son Jordan Davis was killed in an act of hateful and senseless gun violence. After Jordan’s death, McBath dedicated her life to preventing other families from experiencing the same pain she did.

Since taking her first oath of office in January of 2019, she has sought bipartisan solutions to end gun violence, uplift small businesses and our economy, protect and serve our nation’s veterans, and lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs.

Her legislative achievements include the HAVEN Act, which protects veterans experiencing financial hardship; a bill that caps the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare at $35 per month; and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first comprehensive gun safety legislation in over three decades. Her advocacy and her willingness to work with her colleagues for the benefit of the people of Georgia have earned her recognition as an effective lawmaker and one of the House Democratic Caucus’ most important voices.

Congresswoman McBath proudly represents Metro Atlanta in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District, but the most important title she will ever hold is “Jordan’s Mom.”
