Representative Lucy McBath is a mom, a wife, an author, and an advocate.

On Black Friday in 2012, McBath’s son, Jordan Davis, was sitting in the back seat of a friend’s car at a gas station. A man pulled up next to them, complaining about the “loud music” they were playing. The man pulled out a gun and fired 10 shots into the car, hitting Jordan three times, and killing him. 

After Jordan’s death, McBath dedicated her life to preventing other families from experiencing the same pain she did.

McBath left her 30-year career as a flight attendant at Delta Airlines to become the national spokesperson and faith and outreach leader for Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. 

In 2017, after the mass shooting that killed 17 high schoolers at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, McBath knew she had to stand up and run for Congress

Since taking her oath of office in January of 2019, McBath has sought bipartisan solutions to end gun violence, uplift small business and our economy, protect and serve our nation’s veterans, and lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs. 

A two-time breast cancer survivor, Representative McBath knows how important it is to protect those with pre-existing conditions and ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable care. McBath has supported H.R. 1425, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act, a bipartisan bill to ensure that everyone with preexisting conditions is covered. McBath also introduced legislation requiring Medicare to cover hearings aids, and her bill was included in H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act. This landmark, bipartisan legislation would lower the cost of medication, stop big pharmaceutical companies from ripping off families, and reinvest billions in innovation and the search for new cures and treatments. 

McBath has also made protecting small businesses a priority, supporting legislation like the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which would strengthen the Paycheck Protection Program, provide more funding for SBA disaster lending, and ensure that more small businesses have access to the money they need.

In August of 2019, McBath’s bill, the HAVEN Act, which protects veterans in need, was signed into law by President Trump. The Washington Post called this bipartisan piece of legislation the “biggest bill passed” by a freshman this Congress. She has been called “an effective lawmaker” during her first year in Congress, and “one of the House Democratic Caucus’ most important voices.” 

To protect the education of our children, five measures led by McBath were included in the landmark Higher Education Act, a bill to improve the quality of education, lower the cost of college, and expand opportunity for students across America. 

McBath also led bipartisan legislation in December of 2019 to modernize data collection practices and improve epidemic preparedness at the Centers for Disease Control. In March, she secured the $500 million she requested as part of the COVID-19 relief package. 

In addition, she also successfully requested that $25 million in federal funds be allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health for gun violence prevention research, the first of its kind in twenty years.

Representative McBath has made securing federal funds for Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District a priority, helping obtain a $5 million grant to fund the Akers Mill ramp project in Cobb County, as well as supporting a grant to improve the safety and security of Temple Emanu-El in Sandy Springs, which was awarded in November of 2019.

The Congresswoman proudly represents Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District, but the most important title she will ever hold is Jordan’s Mom.
