#### About Governor Kemp 
On November 8, 2022, Governor Brian P. Kemp was re-elected to serve a second term as Georgia's 83rd governor. Governor Kemp ran on a record of success in the Peach State and a plan to help Georgia families fight through 40-year-high inflation, strengthen public safety, and ensure Georgia's children can overcome learning loss due to the pandemic and succeed in the classroom. 

On November 8, 2022, Governor Brian P. Kemp was re-elected to serve a second term as Georgia's 83rd governor. Governor Kemp ran on a record of success in the Peach State and a plan to help Georgia families fight through 40-year-high inflation, strengthen public safety, and ensure Georgia's children can overcome learning loss due to the pandemic and succeed in the classroom. 

A native of Athens, Georgia, Brian Kemp started his first small business over 35 years ago with a pickup truck and a shovel. His experience as a small business owner has drive his mission to put hardworking Georgians first since taking office as Georgia's governor, and his leadership yielded historic results.

Throughout Governor Kemp's first term, Georgia has consistently broken economic records with jobs and investment coming to every corner of the state in communities large and small. Thanks to his decision to reopen first during the COVID-19 pandemic, Georgia's unemployment rate is at its lowest point in state history, there are more Georgians working than ever before, and Georgia has been named the Top State for Business for an unprecedented nine consecutive years. 

Governor Kemp has also championed legislation to crack down on violent crimes and street gangs, end human trafficking and support the victims of that evil industry, enact historic tax cuts for working families, give teachers a historic pay raise, and ensure Georgia's K-12 education system puts parents and students at the forefront.

Governor Kemp, First Lady Marty Kemp, and their three daughters live on their family farm in Athens and are committed to building a safer, stronger Georgia for all who call the Peach State "home."
