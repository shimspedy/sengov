As the Representative for Georgia’s 10th Congressional District, Mike Collins brings decades of experience as an entrepreneur, businessman, and employer to Congress. He and his wife Leigh Ann started a trucking company in the early 1990s that has grown to employ more than 100 Georgians and hauls freight all over America. Mike has also served on the board and as Chairman of one of Georgia’s largest credit unions and president of his local Chamber of Commerce. That experience informs Mike’s top policy priorities, which are to cut wasteful spending and take onerous regulations off the backs of small business owners so our economy can grow and hard-working Americans can thrive.

Representative Collins was born, raised and still resides in Jackson, Georgia. He graduated with a business degree from Georgia State University. He and Leigh Ann have three grown children and four grandchildren.
