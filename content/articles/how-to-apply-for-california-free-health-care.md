## Is Medi-Cal right for my family?

## Who is eligible for Medi-Cal?

Medi-Cal provides free or low-cost health coverage for individuals (adults and children) and families who qualify. To qualify for Medi-Cal, you must live in the state of California and meet certain rules, such as having income under the Medi-Cal limit. If your income is over the Medi-Cal limit, you may still be eligible for help paying for private health care. You may qualify for health insurance even if you are not a U.S. citizen or a U.S. national.

If you have a disability, the process may take up to 90 days. This depends on how quickly you submit the supporting papers and when your doctors submit your records.

To stop delays, please submit all papers as soon as possible.

To speed up the process, tell us if you have an urgent medical or dental need. This could be a serious illness or if you are pregnant.
