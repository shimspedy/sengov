**What is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) in Kentucky?**

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a federally funded initiative designed to assist low-income households in Kentucky with their home energy bills. This program aims to help residents stay warm during the winter and cool in the summer, thereby reducing the risk of health and safety issues like illness, fires, or eviction.

The Kentucky LIHEAP program offers several types of assistance, including:

* **Bill Payment Assistance**: Helps cover the cost of energy bills.
* **Energy Crisis Assistance**: Provides emergency help for households facing immediate energy-related crises.
* **Weatherization and Energy-Related Home Repairs**: Offers support for making homes more energy-efficient and safe.

**Eligibility for Kentucky LIHEAP**

To qualify for the LIHEAP program in Kentucky, you must:

1. Be a resident of Kentucky.
2. Require financial assistance with home energy costs.

Participants or their family members who are enrolled in other benefit programs, such as SNAP, SSI, or TANF, are automatically eligible for LIHEAP. Additionally, eligibility is based on household income, which must be below the specified limits:

| Household Size | Maximum Income Level (Per Year) |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1              | $21,870                         |
| 2              | $29,580                         |
| 3              | $37,290                         |
| 4              | $45,000                         |
| 5              | $52,710                         |
| 6              | $60,420                         |
| 7              | $68,130                         |
| 8              | $75,840                         |

\*For households with more than eight people, add $7,710 per additional person. Always check with the appropriate managing agency for the most current guidelines.

**How to Apply for Kentucky LIHEAP**

When applying for the Kentucky LIHEAP program, you will need to provide the following documents:

1. Your most recent heating bill or proof that heating costs are included in your rent.
2. Social Security Numbers or Permanent Residence Card Numbers for all household members.
3. Proof of all household income from the previous month.

For those seeking assistance with natural gas or electricity through the crisis component, a disconnect or past-due notice (e.g., termination notice, final notice) is required. If your rent includes heating costs, you must bring an eviction notice from your landlord.
