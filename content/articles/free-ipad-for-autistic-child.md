The iPad For Kids Program revolutionized and unlocked the communication barrier for children on the spectrum. The iPad gives a voice to the voiceless. The iPad apps for autism are easy-to-use, and allow for children to put words and symbols together and eventually create sentences using images. They are also extremely mobile. [ASDF has donated iPads](https://myasdf.org/ipad-for-kids-application/) to individuals and special education classrooms to help nonverbal autistic children with communication and learning.
