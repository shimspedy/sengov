#### Overview of Pennsylvania's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Pennsylvania provides critical food assistance to low-income individuals and families, helping them achieve a more nutritious diet and improve their overall well-being. As of 2023, Pennsylvania's SNAP program continues to adapt and evolve, ensuring that it meets the needs of its diverse population through various policy options and administrative practices.

#### Program Administration

Pennsylvania administers its SNAP program at the state level, which allows for consistent and streamlined management across all counties. This centralized approach helps in maintaining uniformity in service delivery and policy implementation, ensuring that all eligible residents receive equitable access to SNAP benefits.

#### Reporting Requirements

Pennsylvania employs a combination of simplified and change reporting systems for SNAP households. Simplified reporting requires households to report changes periodically and when total countable income exceeds 130% of the federal poverty level, or when able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) work less than 20 hours per week. This system reduces the reporting burden on households and helps maintain their eligibility with minimal administrative overhead.

#### Certification Periods

The state offers certification periods ranging from 4 to 24 months for households with simplified reporting requirements. This flexibility accommodates the varying circumstances of SNAP participants, allowing for longer certification periods for elderly or disabled households without earned income, thereby reducing the frequency of required interactions with the SNAP office.

#### Self-Employment Income

Pennsylvania uses a method approved by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to calculate the cost of doing business for self-employed individuals. This approach ensures that self-employed SNAP participants can accurately deduct their business expenses from their income, resulting in a fair assessment of their eligibility and benefit levels.

#### Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs)

Pennsylvania mandates the use of Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs) for all SNAP households. This policy simplifies the process of calculating utility costs by using a standard amount, which is easier to administer and understand for both participants and administrators.

#### Treatment of Ineligible Noncitizens' Income

For ineligible noncitizens, Pennsylvania counts all but a prorated share of their income and deductions when determining the eligibility and benefit amount for eligible household members. This policy ensures that the economic contributions of noncitizens are fairly considered without penalizing the eligible members of the household.

#### Child Support Payments

Pennsylvania treats legally obligated child support payments made to non-household members as a deduction. This policy encourages the payment of child support by reducing the payer’s gross income considered for SNAP eligibility, thus promoting financial responsibility.

#### Drug Felony Disqualifications

Pennsylvania has modified the federal disqualification policy for individuals convicted of drug-related felonies. Instead of imposing a lifetime ban, the state may allow these individuals to regain eligibility for SNAP benefits under certain conditions, such as participation in a drug treatment program or submission to drug testing.

#### Work Requirements and Disqualifications

SNAP household members aged 16-59 must comply with general work requirements, including work registration, job acceptance, and participation in employment and training programs if mandated. Noncompliance without good cause results in disqualification periods that increase with each subsequent violation. Pennsylvania has chosen to apply the minimum disqualification periods, ensuring a balance between encouraging employment and maintaining access to essential food assistance.

#### Employment and Training Programs

Pennsylvania offers voluntary participation in SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs, providing SNAP participants with opportunities to improve their job skills and employment prospects. These programs are tailored to meet the needs of the participants, helping them achieve greater self-sufficiency.

#### Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE)

Pennsylvania adopts broad-based categorical eligibility, which extends SNAP benefits to households receiving non-cash benefits funded by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Maintenance of Effort funds. This policy simplifies the application process and broadens access to SNAP for low-income households.

#### Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA)

Pennsylvania provides Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA) to households leaving TANF or state-funded cash assistance programs. TBA offers a fixed benefit amount for up to five months, allowing families to transition smoothly without the immediate need for extensive reporting, thus ensuring continued access to food assistance during a critical period.

#### Demonstrations for Elderly and Disabled Individuals

Pennsylvania participates in the Elderly Simplified Application Project (ESAP), streamlining the application process for elderly and disabled households. This project includes extended certification periods, simplified verification processes, and waives recertification interviews, reducing the administrative burden on these vulnerable populations.

Pennsylvania’s SNAP program is adaptable approach to food assistance, ensuring that it meets the diverse needs of its low-income residents. Through thoughtful implementation of federal options and state-specific policies, Pennsylvania continues to enhance the effectiveness and reach of SNAP, contributing to the health and well-being of its communities.
