Jack in the Box, the fast-food chain known for its diverse menu, participates in the Restaurant Meals Program (RMP), allowing SNAP EBT cardholders to enjoy their offerings at select locations.

**EBT at Jack in the Box: A Quick Guide**

If you’re a fan of Jack in the Box’s savory burgers or crispy fries and have SNAP EBT benefits, you might be able to use your card at one of the 547 participating locations across Arizona and California. These locations are part of the RMP, which is designed to help those who may not have the means to prepare their own meals.

**Eligible Items for EBT at Jack in the Box**

When using EBT at Jack in the Box, you can purchase food items intended for immediate consumption. This includes most of the menu offerings like burgers, tacos, and shakes. However, it’s important to remember that non-food items or merchandise are not eligible for purchase with EBT funds.

**Budgeting Your Benefits**

Being part of the RMP doesn’t mean additional benefits; it simply allows you to use your existing SNAP funds at approved eateries. To make your benefits stretch, consider using coupons or the Jack in the Box mobile app for discounts.

**Qualifying for the RMP**

To use your EBT card at Jack in the Box, you must meet the RMP eligibility criteria:

* Residency in a state with an active RMP.
* Challenges in preparing meals at home due to age, homelessness, or disability.
* Choosing a Jack in the Box location that is authorized to accept EBT.

If you’re eligible, your caseworker should activate the restaurant option on your EBT card. If you encounter any issues, contact them to ensure your card is properly set up for restaurant use.

**Finding EBT-Approved Jack in the Box Locations**

Not all Jack in the Box restaurants accept EBT, as each location must be individually authorized. To find out which ones do, check with your local Jack in the Box or state SNAP agency.

In summary, Jack in the Box’s participation in the RMP offers eligible SNAP recipients the chance to enjoy their fast-food favorites using EBT benefits. By understanding the program’s guidelines and confirming your eligibility, you can make informed choices and enjoy a meal without worry. Keep an eye out for updates as the program may expand to include more locations in the future.
