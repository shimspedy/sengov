### Oregon's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Oregon is designed to help individuals and families with low incomes to buy nutritious food. The program is a crucial component of the state’s efforts to combat hunger and improve the health and well-being of residents. This overview provides a detailed look at the various aspects of Oregon's SNAP program, including eligibility requirements, benefits, and state-specific policies.

#### Program Administration
Oregon’s SNAP is administered at the state level. This centralization allows for consistent policy implementation and streamlined services across the entire state. The Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS) is responsible for managing the program, ensuring compliance with federal regulations, and assisting residents with their applications and benefits.

#### Reporting Requirements
Oregon employs a combination of simplified and change reporting for SNAP households. This means that households must report changes in their circumstances periodically and when their total countable income exceeds 130 percent of the federal poverty level, among other specified conditions. This dual reporting system is designed to balance the need for up-to-date information with administrative efficiency.

#### Certification Periods
SNAP households in Oregon with simplified reporting requirements are certified for periods ranging from 4 to 24 months. This flexible certification period allows the state to adjust the length of certification based on the specific needs and situations of different households, ensuring that benefits are provided efficiently while maintaining program integrity.

#### Self-Employment Income
For determining self-employment income, Oregon uses methods other than actual costs, such as a simplified self-employment expense deduction. This approach simplifies the application process for self-employed individuals, making it easier for them to access SNAP benefits.

#### Standard Utility Allowances (SUA)
Oregon mandates the use of Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs) for all households instead of actual utility costs. This policy simplifies the calculation of benefits and ensures that all households are treated equitably regarding their utility expenses.

#### Treatment of Noncitizen Income
In Oregon, the income and deductions of ineligible noncitizens are considered when determining the eligibility and benefit amount for eligible household members. Specifically, the state counts all but a prorated share of the income and deductions of ineligible noncitizens for both pre- and post-PRWORA (Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act).

#### Child Support Payments
Oregon treats legally obligated child support payments made to non-household members as an income exclusion. This policy helps to encourage child support payments by excluding the paid amount from being considered part of the payer’s gross income.

#### Drug Felony Disqualifications
Oregon imposes a modified ban on individuals convicted of a federal or state felony offense involving controlled substances. The state’s approach includes specific conditions under which these individuals can regain eligibility, such as participation in a drug treatment program.

#### Employment and Training Programs
The state operates voluntary SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs. These programs are designed to help SNAP recipients gain skills, training, and work experience to increase their employability and reduce dependency on public assistance.

#### Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD)
Oregon has obtained partial waivers for the ABAWD time limit in areas with high unemployment or insufficient jobs. This flexibility ensures that vulnerable individuals in these areas can continue to receive SNAP benefits while seeking employment.

#### Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE)
Oregon has adopted broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE), which extends categorical eligibility to households that receive non-cash benefits funded by TANF or Maintenance of Effort funds. This policy allows for more streamlined application processes and broader access to benefits.

#### Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA)
Oregon offers the Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA), providing continued SNAP benefits for up to five months for households leaving TANF or state-funded cash assistance programs. This policy helps to ensure a smooth transition for families moving towards self-sufficiency.

#### Demonstrations for Elderly and Disabled
Oregon participates in the Standard Medical Deduction (SMD) demonstration project. This initiative simplifies the process of claiming medical expense deductions for households with elderly members or individuals with disabilities, making it easier for these households to access the benefits they need.

Oregon's SNAP program has a range of policies and options designed to meet the diverse needs of its residents. Through state-administered initiatives, flexible reporting and certification periods, and supportive measures for vulnerable populations, Oregon aims to ensure that its SNAP program effectively addresses hunger and supports the well-being of its low-income households.
