# How to Get Free Cell Phone Service from the Government

More than a dozen companies are ready to send you a free government cell phone. The process is simple and straight forward.

Despite the new Affordable Connectivity Program offering better cell phones and more comprehensive service, the information here remains accurate.

### Why the Lifeline Assistance Program is Essential

The Lifeline Assistance Program, often hailed as one of the most successful government initiatives, has provided millions of Americans with essential communication tools. Estimates suggest that between 12 to 15 million Americans have benefited from free cell phones, enabling them to find work, stay in touch with family, and manage everyday communications.

### Participating Companies

Numerous regional and national companies across 49 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico are approved to provide these free phones and services. Each state has multiple providers, some with over a dozen options.
