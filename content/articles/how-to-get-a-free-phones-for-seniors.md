The Lifeline program helps seniors afford communication services on a limited income.

### Tips for Choosing the Right Plan
- **Assess Your Needs**: Evaluate your data, talk time, and text messaging needs. Some plans offer unlimited talk and text but limited data, and vice versa.
- **Compare Carrier Coverage**: Ensure the carrier or MVNO has good coverage in your area to avoid dropped calls and frustration.
- **Consider Additional Features**: Look for features like large buttons, hearing aid compatibility, emergency call buttons, or health monitoring services.
- **Watch for Hidden Fees**: Check the fine print for charges like activation fees, early termination penalties, or unnecessary additional services.

By following these tips and exploring the options, seniors can find the perfect free phone plan to stay connected without breaking the bank.
