Wouldn’t it be great if you could get a tablet or computer for you and your family at no cost or very low cost?

Everyone knows that access to the internet is an essential service. In the modern pandemic world, it’s impossible to get by without the ability to send emails, apply for jobs, check the news, engage in remote learning, or stay in touch with friends and family. A tablet is much easier to use than a phone for many of these daily tasks, but the cost of tablets can be prohibitive.


The truth is that absolutely free tablets for low income people can be tough to come by. However, there are incredible deals out there for low-cost computers and tablets, and there are even more great offers available if you have one or more kids in school.

Keep reading to discover what you need to know about affordable or free tablets for low income families. We’ll close with a hot tip on how you can get a brand new tablet for just $10.01!

## The Importance of Affordable or Free Tablets for Low-Income Families

Our guide will walk you through several sources where you may be able to access affordable or free tablets or computers for low-income families. First, though, we need to explore more of why getting a tablet is so important.

Think of it this way: a tablet can do almost everything a computer can do while being completely portable. This means you can easily share the tablet around the house, and everyone can do what they need to do with it.

For example, children in your household may use a tablet for school as well as enjoy TikTok or YouTube. Adults, meanwhile, can use tablets to discover local job openings and apply online. And applying online instead of in-person may be safer in the age of COVID-19.

Speaking of COVID-19, many jobs now offer the opportunity for employees to work from home. And when you have a tablet or computer and internet access, you’ll be able to work such jobs without even leaving the house.

Read on for some leads on how you may be able to access other hardware like desktop or laptop computers at low cost, as well as information on affordable or free tablets.

## Computer Technology Assistance Corps

The [Computer Technology Assistance Corps](https://ctac-nh.org/node/12) (or CTAC) is a donation-based organization that provides affordable desktop and laptop computers to qualifying low-income families as well as schools and faith-based organizations. They collect donations, refurbish the donations, and pass the savings along to recipients.

## Computers With Causes

[Computers With Causes](https://www.computerswithcauses.org/application.htm) is an organization available throughout the nation that distributes gifted computer equipment including tablets to people and families in difficult situations. It offers an opportunity for those in need of computers to apply on their website. The turnaround time for applications is thirty days, and it’s important to know that acceptance of a donated computer from Computers With Causes may have the potential to impact certain government benefits such as [SNAP](https://sengov.com/snap-calculator/) and SSDI.

The primary intention of these free tablets and computers is to help students with educational needs as well as help disabled veterans who may need internet access.

## The On It Foundation – Florida

If you’re in the state of Florida and in search of a computer for a young person who needs it for school, you’ll want to know about the [On It Foundation](https://theonitfoundation.org/). The name stands for “Opportunities Necessary to Increase Technology,” and their mission is to increase access to technology in under-resourced households that include kids in K-12 education programs.

The easiest way for Florida residents to apply for the program is to use the website. However, you can also visit the physical locations for the foundation and apply there. Either way, you can take advantage of their employment training opportunities and other resources.

## Computers For Learning

[Computers For Learning](https://computersforlearning.gov/htm/hp_eligibility.htm) is a program backed by the federal government that is designed to support organizations and schools with access to digital devices.

That means that they work with schools rather than individuals, so this organization is not a quick fix to an immediate need. But if you pass the eligibility requirements along with the school(s) you or your family are involved with, the administration may use this organization to provide free tablets for all students.

## Computers For Kids – Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Utah

As the name implies, [Computers For Kids](https://www.cfkid.org/) is designed to help provide low-cost tablets and computers to children. Specifically, it is intended to provide this equipment to students who are enrolled in school or directly to schools or non-profit organizations. Unlike some of the other organizations addressed in this article, Computers for Kids does not have income requirements for participation in their program. The program also offers a donation against the already low cost of equipment for low-income applicants.

This organization supports populations in Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Utah. They are an authorized Microsoft refurbisher, and they have donated over 50,000 computers since 2002. The way it works is that people donate old tablets and computers, and this organization refurbishes the equipment, then makes the equipment available at a nominal cost. Therefore, even though you or your children would be getting refurbished equipment, you can rest assured that it will operate as if it was brand new.

## Interconnection

[Interconnection](https://interconnection.org/) was originally designed to service the Seattle area, though you don’t have to live in Seattle to benefit from the services this site has to offer. They are also an organization that accepts donations of used devices, then refurbishes and sells them at very accessible prices.

You can use the site to search for specific tablets and PCs or browse what’s available in either the regular online store or ConnectAll.org, the online store for low income shoppers. Both storefronts offer amazing deals, and much of the equipment sold is covered by a one-year warranty.

Keep in mind that what is in stock changes often, so even if you don’t see any free tablets you want right away, it is worth bookmarking this site and checking back regularly.

## Other Factors To Be Aware Of

Right now, you are most likely focused on getting the equipment you need in your hands. Before you start filling out applications, it will pay off to gather the information you need in advance.

For example, most of the organizations above will require you to provide proof of things like income. So make sure you have ready access to documents like last year’s tax returns that help prove your household income.

And some organizations require students to complete community service hours to receive a free tablet. So make sure you check the “fine print” regarding how you must document those service hours and where you need to send the documentation.

Finally, if you are getting a tablet for your child to take to school, keep in mind that the school may have its own requirements for the device. This often involves deleting social media apps and other messenger functions from the tablet before taking it into class.

## Affordable Internet Access

Of course, getting the tablet is only half the battle. To get the most use out of your new tablet, you must have a reliable internet connection.

Many families who meet the low-income requirements for these different organizations also qualify for the [Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)](https://acp.sengov.com/). This governmental program provides eligible households with a discount on broadband service and connected devices.
