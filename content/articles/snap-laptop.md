# SNAP Laptop Program

The SNAP Laptop Program helps low-income individuals gain access to essential technology needed for education and employment. Many low-income families and students cannot afford computers, which limits their opportunities for learning and career advancement. This program offers eligible SNAP recipients laptops that have been refurbished at lower prices or with financial assistance.

In this post, I’ll share comprehensive information about every aspect of the SNAP Laptop Program. We’ll explore eligibility criteria, required documentation, and the application process. Additionally, I’ll provide tips on other ways to obtain free laptops from the government.

## What is SNAP? A Brief Introduction

The SNAP program, managed by the USDA, is a significant government aid effort previously known as the Food Stamp Program. SNAP helps low-income individuals and families purchase food from approved stores across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.

The goal of SNAP is to combat hunger and ensure that individuals, especially those facing financial hardship, have access to nutritious food. According to a Pew Research report, approximately 42 million residents across 23 million households receive SNAP benefits. These benefits are accessed through EBT cards, which enable recipients to purchase healthy food, thereby enhancing their food security and health.
