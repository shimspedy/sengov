## Does Subway Take EBT?

The answer is yes, but only at certain locations and under certain conditions. Subway can accept EBT as part of the Restaurant Meals Program (RMP), which allows some SNAP recipients to buy hot and prepared food at authorized restaurants.

However, not all states have the RMP, and not all Subway locations participate in it. Currently, only Arizona, California, and Rhode Island have Subway restaurants that accept EBT through the RMP. There are also other restaurants in these states that take EBT as well.

As more states join the RMP, more Subway locations may be able to accept EBT in the future. We will update this list as new information becomes available. Some users have also reported that they were able to use their EBT cards at Subway locations inside grocery stores (like Walmart), gas stations, and travel plazas.

However, this method is not very reliable and may depend on the store manager's discretion. We recommend that you check with the store before you try to use your EBT card there.

## What Can You Buy with EBT at Subway?

SNAP benefits are intended to help you buy food that you can eat at home. However, thanks to the RMP, you can also use them to buy meals at restaurants if you qualify. But you can't use them to buy non-food items, such as merchandise or refillable cups.

When you go to Subway with your EBT card, you should stick to the food items that are eligible for SNAP benefits. These include sandwiches, salads, soups, cookies, chips, and sodas. You can also customize your order with different breads, cheeses, meats, veggies, and sauces.

If you want to know more about what you can buy with EBT at Subway, you can ask the restaurant staff for help. They can answer your questions and explain any specific policies that may apply to their location.

## Who Can Buy Subway with EBT?

To use your EBT card at Subway, you have to meet the criteria for the RMP. This means that you have to:

- Live in a state that has the RMP.
- Have difficulty cooking at home because you are elderly, homeless, or disabled.
- Buy food from a restaurant that is approved by the state to accept EBT payments.

If you meet these conditions, your caseworker will activate your card for use at participating restaurants. If your card is declined, you should contact your caseworker to find out why you are not authorized to use it.

## Which Subway Locations Take EBT?

Not every Subway location can take EBT, even if they are in a state that has the RMP. Each Subway restaurant has to get approval from the state to accept EBT payments. This means that some Subway locations may take EBT, while others may not.

To make sure that you are at the right place, you should always verify that the Subway location you are visiting is a participating location. You can do this by looking for a sign that says "We Accept EBT" or by asking the staff if they take EBT.
