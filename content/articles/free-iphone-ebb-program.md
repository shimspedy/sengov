### How To Get a Free iPhone from the EBB Program 

having access to a mobile phone and the internet is crucial for staying in touch with loved ones and conducting business. However, many people struggle to afford these necessities, especially during the pandemic. To address this, the FCC established the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) program, providing financial assistance for internet and telecommunications services.

### Understanding the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) Program

The Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) program, a government initiative, offered eligible low-income households discounted or free access to high-speed internet and telecommunications services. Eligible households could receive a monthly discount of up to $50, and those on tribal lands could get up to $75. Additionally, EBB providers offered a one-time discount of up to $100 on devices, provided the household contributed between $10 and $50 towards the device.

Launched in 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EBB program aimed to bridge the digital divide and support economic growth by ensuring low-income households could stay connected. The program benefited over 8 million households across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

However, the EBB program ended on December 31, 2023, and was replaced by the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which continues to offer similar benefits.
