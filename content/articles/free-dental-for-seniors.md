Having trouble covering the costs of dental care? Thankfully, in 2024, free dental care initiatives are accessible for individuals meeting specific income criteria. These programs provide a range of services, particularly for those enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid.

No matter your age, you can keep your gums and teeth healthy, strong and pain-free. As an older adult, you are prone to gum disease and other oral health problems, but by brushing twice a day, flossing daily and seeing your dentist regularly, you can lower your risk. Medi‑Cal will pay up to $1,800 in a year for covered dental services. You may qualify for no yearly limit.

#### Aging and Dental Health

As we age, we are more prone to developing oral health problems. Here are some common dental problems you may face as you age:

1. **Tooth Decay**
   - Tooth decay is the destruction of your tooth enamel, the hard outer layer of your teeth. It may cause cavities or even tooth loss.

2. **Gum Disease**
   - Gum disease is an infection of the gum tissue that supports the teeth.

3. **Tooth Loss**
   - Tooth loss is a process in which one or more teeth come loose and fall out. Gum disease is one of the leading causes of tooth loss.

4. **Receding Gums**
   - Receding gums is when your gums pull back from the tooth surface, exposing the root surfaces of your teeth. This leaves the teeth at risk of decay, infection, and loss.

#### Don’t Miss Your Dental Visit

Regular dental visits are important to prevent problems. Dentists check for oral health problems, some that might not even be noticeable. Check-ups can help find cavities, gum disease, and other problems before they lead to more serious issues like pain, infection, and tooth loss.

Dental visits are covered for Medi-Cal members. Find a dentist accepting new patients at [SmileCalifornia.org](http://SmileCalifornia.org).

#### Here are a few more important tips:
- Brush your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.
- Floss your teeth at least once a day.
- Limit sugary snacks and drinks, which can lead to cavities.
- Limit alcohol intake and avoid all forms of tobacco use, which can lead to stained teeth, bad breath, and can cause cancer.
- Use your Medi-Cal dental benefit and see your dentist yearly.
