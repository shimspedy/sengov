#### Overview of California's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in California, also known as CalFresh, provides essential food assistance to low-income individuals and families, helping them afford nutritious food and improve their overall health. California's SNAP program is distinct in its administration and policies, reflecting the state's efforts to address the needs of its diverse population.

#### Program Administration

California administers its SNAP program at the county level. This decentralized approach allows for local customization and responsiveness to the specific needs of different communities within the state. Each county's social services department manages the application process, eligibility determination, and distribution of benefits.

#### Reporting Requirements

California employs a simplified reporting system for SNAP households. Under this system, households are required to report changes in their circumstances periodically rather than immediately. This reduces the administrative burden on both participants and county offices and helps maintain program accessibility.

#### Certification Periods

California offers certification periods of 12 and 24 months for households with simplified reporting requirements. Longer certification periods are typically granted to households with elderly or disabled members without earned income, minimizing the need for frequent re-evaluations and providing greater stability.

#### Self-Employment Income

For self-employed individuals, California uses an alternative method to calculate business expenses. This method ensures that self-employed SNAP participants can accurately deduct their business costs, resulting in a fairer assessment of their net income and eligibility for benefits.

#### Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs)

California mandates the use of Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs) for all SNAP households. By using a standardized amount for utility costs, the state simplifies the calculation process, making it easier for both participants and administrators to understand and manage.

#### Treatment of Ineligible Noncitizens' Income

In California, for ineligible noncitizens, the state counts all but a prorated share of their income and deductions when determining the eligibility and benefit amount for eligible household members. This policy ensures that the financial contributions of noncitizens are fairly considered without unduly penalizing eligible members of the household.

#### Child Support Payments

California allows a deduction for legally obligated child support payments made to non-household members. This policy supports the financial responsibility of paying child support by reducing the payerâ€™s gross income considered for SNAP eligibility, thus encouraging continued support.

#### Drug Felony Disqualifications

California has modified the federal disqualification policy for individuals convicted of drug-related felonies. Instead of imposing a lifetime ban, the state allows these individuals to regain eligibility for SNAP benefits under certain conditions, such as participation in a drug treatment program or compliance with drug testing requirements.

#### Work Requirements and Disqualifications

SNAP household members in California aged 16-59 must comply with general work requirements, which include work registration, job acceptance, and participation in employment and training programs if mandated. Noncompliance without good cause results in minimum disqualification periods, ensuring a balance between promoting employment and maintaining access to essential food assistance.

#### Employment and Training Programs

California offers voluntary participation in SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs, providing opportunities for SNAP participants to improve their job skills and employment prospects. These programs are tailored to meet the needs of participants, helping them achieve greater self-sufficiency.

#### Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE)

California adopts broad-based categorical eligibility, which extends SNAP benefits to households receiving non-cash benefits funded by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Maintenance of Effort funds. This policy simplifies the application process and broadens access to SNAP for low-income households.

#### Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA)

California provides Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA) to households leaving TANF or state-funded cash assistance programs. TBA offers a fixed benefit amount for up to five months, allowing families to transition smoothly without the immediate need for extensive reporting, thus ensuring continued access to food assistance during critical periods.

#### Demonstrations for Elderly and Disabled Individuals

California participates in both the Elderly Simplified Application Project (ESAP) and the Standard Medical Deduction (SMD). ESAP streamlines the application process for elderly and disabled households, while SMD simplifies the deduction of medical expenses. These projects reduce administrative burdens and make it easier for elderly and disabled individuals to access SNAP benefits.

California's SNAP program has an adaptable approach to food assistance, ensuring that it meets the diverse needs of its low-income residents. Through thoughtful implementation of federal options and state-specific policies, California continues to enhance the effectiveness and reach of SNAP, contributing to the health and well-being of its communities.
