### How to Get a Free Tablet from the Government in California in 2024

California is participating in a government-sponsored program designed to provide free tablets to eligible low-income families. This initiative aims to bridge the digital divide by offering access to essential digital resources, including free tablets and internet services.

1. **Income Requirements**: Households with an income at or below 135% of the federal poverty guidelines may qualify. The specific income threshold varies based on household size.
2. **Government Assistance Program Participation**: Enrollment in certain programs automatically qualifies individuals. These programs include Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and federal public housing assistance.
3. **Alternative Program Eligibility**: Participation in the National School Lunch Program or the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program can also make individuals eligible, even if they do not meet other criteria.
4. **Household Limitations**: The benefit is restricted to one tablet per household. A household is defined as individuals who share income and expenses.
