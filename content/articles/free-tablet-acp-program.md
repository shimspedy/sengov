### How Do I Qualify for ACP?


 #### What is ACP?
ACP stands for Affordable Connectivity Program. It is a government-sponsored program that provides discounts on internet service and connected devices for low-income households. The program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) with oversight from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

Eligible households can receive a monthly discount of up to $30 on their internet service bill. They can also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to help cover the cost of a connected device, such as a laptop or tablet.

The ACP is a great way to help low-income households afford internet service. 

ACP Requirements
To qualify for the ACP, households must meet certain income requirements. They must also participate in one of the following government assistance programs:

-  SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program)
    Your net income is your gross income minus any allowable deductions. And assets are "countable resources" like cash, money in a bank account, and certain vehicles. For fiscal year 2023 (Oct. 1, 2022 – Sept. 30, 2023), a two-member household with a net monthly income of $1,526 (100% of poverty) might qualify for SNAP.

    Because each state has a different application form and process, a member of your household must contact your state agency directly to apply. You can contact your state agency by visiting your local SNAP office, visiting your state agency's website, or calling your state's toll-free SNAP Information hotline.


- Medicaid 
    Medicaid is a joint federal and state program providing health coverage to over 77.9 million Americans, including children, pregnant women, parents, seniors, and people with disabilities. It's the largest health coverage source in the U.S.

    #### Eligibility

    1. **Mandatory Coverage**: 
    - Low-income families
    - Pregnant women and children
    - SSI recipients

    2. **Optional Coverage**:
    - Home and community-based service recipients
    - Children in foster care

    #### Expansion and Eligibility Rules
    - **Affordable Care Act**: States can expand Medicaid to cover more low-income individuals under 65. Many states have done this.
    - **Income-Based Eligibility**: Uses Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to determine eligibility for most applicants, including children, pregnant women, and parents.
    - **Non-Financial Requirements**: Must be a resident of the state, a U.S. citizen, or a qualified non-citizen.


- WIC (Women, Infants, and Children)
    The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age 5 who are found to be at nutritional risk.

    The WIC program safeguards the health of low-income women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets, information on healthy eating, and referrals to health care.

    The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children - better known as the WIC program - serves to safeguard the health of low-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets, information on healthy eating including breastfeeding promotion and support, and referrals to health care.

    This website is maintained by the Food and Nutrition Service, a federal agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, responsible for administering the WIC program at the national and regional levels.

    ### How to Apply for WIC
    The Food and Nutrition Service administers the WIC program at the federal level; state agencies are responsible for determining participant eligibility and providing benefits and services, and for authorizing vendors.

    To apply to be a WIC participant, you will need to contact your state or local agency to set up an appointment. Check out your state's website or call the toll-free number. When you call to set up an appointment, someone will tell you the location nearest your home and what you need to bring with you.

- Pell Grants
    Federal Pell Grant Program with Free Internet Access
    The Federal Pell Grant Program is the largest federal grant program offered to undergraduate students. It is designed to help low-income students pay for college. Pell Grants do not have to be repaid, which makes them a great way to help students reduce their student loan debt.

    Federal Pell Grants usually are awarded only to undergraduate students who display exceptional financial need and have not earned a bachelor's, graduate, or professional degree. (In some cases, however, a student enrolled in a postbaccalaureate teacher certification program might receive a Federal Pell Grant.) You are not eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant if you are incarcerated in a federal or state penal institution or are subject to an involuntary civil commitment upon completion of a period of incarceration for a forcible or non-forcible sexual offense.


    To be eligible for a Pell Grant, students must:

    - Be enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an eligible institution.
    - Be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen.
    - Demonstrate financial need.
    - Have not earned a bachelor's or graduate degree.

    The amount of a Pell Grant award depends on a student's financial need, the cost of attendance at their school, and their status as a full-time or part-time student. The maximum Pell Grant award for the 2023-2024 award year is $7,395.

    To apply for a Pell Grant, students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA is available online at studentaid.gov.

    The Federal Pell Grant Program is a great way to help students pay for college. If you are eligible, be sure to apply for a Pell Grant.

- Free or reduced-price school lunch
    The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age 5 who are found to be at nutritional risk.

    All households with a child who was approved to receive free or reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) or the School Breakfast Program (SBP) within the last 12 months, including children who attend schools participating in the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), are eligible for ACP benefits.

    In order to participate in the program, schools must offer a variety of healthy foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. They must also meet certain nutrition standards for calories, fat, and sodium.

    The NSLP is a valuable program that helps to ensure that all children have access to healthy meals. The program has helped to reduce childhood hunger and obesity, and it has also helped to improve academic performance.

    - The NSLP is funded by a combination of federal and state funds.
