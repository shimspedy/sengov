## What Do You Need to Know About ACP?

The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) is a government-funded initiative that provides discounted internet services to eligible low-income households. Since its inception, the ACP has played a crucial role in bridging the digital divide and ensuring affordable access to broadband services. However, with the ACP benefit ending soon, it’s essential to understand the implications and explore alternative options.

### What is the ACP?
The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) is the Federal Communications Commission’s program launched on December 31st, 2021, replacing the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) program. This government-funded program helps bring affordable internet access to low-income households across the United States. It’s important to note that ACP is a separate program from the Lifeline benefit, which focuses on discounted phone service.

Administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) under the FCC’s oversight, the ACP program helps bridge the digital divide for those who need it most. A consumer can qualify for the ACP benefit if their income is 200% or less than the federal poverty guidelines, has no income, or if they participate in certain government programs such as Lifeline, SNAP/Food Stamps, Medicaid, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).

### When is the ACP Program Ending?
The FCC announced that the full benefit of ACP discounted phone service would end in April. However, there is still some support for existing customers in May. So, to answer the question, “Is ACP ending in April?”—not entirely. The FCC will provide a partial benefit in May.

### Why is the ACP Freezing Enrollments?
Since February 8, 2024, only existing ACP participants can switch providers. New applications are no longer being accepted due to a lack of funding. The initial $14.2 billion allocated by Congress is projected to run out by April 2024. This means existing enrollees can continue receiving the benefit until then, but there are not enough funds to provide for new ones. Freezing new enrollment was done to secure benefits for existing participants.

### Why is the ACP Program Ending?
In late 2023, many disadvantaged Americans faced a worrying prospect: news reports predicted the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) could run out of funding and near the end of 2024. This program provides vital internet subsidies, and its closure threatens the financial well-being of countless individuals who rely on it for work and staying connected. Losing ACP could mean facing the full cost of internet service, a significant burden for many. The primary reason for the ACP ending is the depletion of its funding. If Congress allocates more funding, the program may continue for a longer period.

### Will the ACP Program Continue?
The future of ACP is uncertain. Congress is considering proposals to extend the program, with some bills seeking additional funding and others exploring ways to have internet providers shoulder the cost. The outcome of these discussions will determine whether the ACP continues to help bridge the digital divide. But for now, the official end date for the ACP is May 2024, until further notice.

## What Should You Do After ACP Ends?

### Transfer ACP Services to the Lifeline Program
One of the primary options available to eligible households is to transfer their discounted internet service to the Lifeline program. The Lifeline program is a long-standing federal initiative that provides discounted communication services, including broadband internet, to qualifying low-income households.

### What is the Lifeline Benefit?
The Lifeline program, established in 1985 by the Federal Communications Commission, was created to help eligible low-income consumers in all states, territories, commonwealths, and Tribal lands access telecommunication services.

The Lifeline program offers a monthly discount of up to $9.25 per household for broadband internet service. Additionally, households on Tribal lands can receive an enhanced discount of up to $34.25 per month. This benefit can be applied to various types of internet services, including fixed broadband, mobile broadband, and bundled voice and data plans.

### How Can I Transfer from ACP to Lifeline?
Before the ACP program ends, transferring from the current program to the Lifeline program requires meeting the eligibility criteria and applying through an approved Lifeline service provider. This process typically involves resubmitting proof of income or participation in qualifying government assistance programs like Medicaid, SNAP, or Federal Public Housing Assistance.

Many ACP service providers also offer Lifeline, simplifying the transition. For instance, most Wireless programs is provide both Lifeline and ACP services in over 35 states across the US. Qualified subscribers can keep their connection and phone number with a smooth switch to Lifeline service.

### What If I’m Not Eligible for the Lifeline Program?
If you are not eligible for the Lifeline program, you may need to explore alternative options to maintain your internet access after the ACP program ends. Here are some potential solutions:
- **Explore Alternative Service Providers**: Research other internet service providers in your area that offer prepaid plans at an affordable or discounted price for low-income households. Some providers may have their own assistance programs or special pricing tiers.
- **Seek Local or State Assistance Programs**: Check with your local or state government agencies to see if they offer any internet assistance programs or subsidies for low-income residents.

###  What Happens Next?
some Wireless companies are committed to helping its current ACP subscribers maintain their connection after the ACP ends in 2024. They provide ACP customers with a variety of alternative solutions tailored to individual needs, ensuring everyone stays connected with the best possible phone service.
