### How to Get a Free Government iPhone

Are you looking for ways to get a free iPhone  through government programs? While there’s no direct government initiative that provides free iPhones, there are several programs and organizations that can help you get a smartphone at little to no cost. Here’s how you can take advantage of these opportunities.

### Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)

The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) is a federal initiative aimed at helping low-income households afford internet service and connected devices. Here's how it works:

- **Eligibility**: Your household must have an income at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or you must participate in programs like SNAP, Medicaid, or SSI.
- **Benefits**: The ACP offers a discount of up to $30 per month on your internet bill ($75 per month for households on Tribal lands). Additionally, you may receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers.

### Lifeline Program

The Lifeline program provides a discount on phone or internet services for eligible low-income households. While it doesn't directly offer free iPhones, the savings on your phone or internet bill can help you afford a smartphone.

- **Eligibility**: Your income must be at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or you must participate in programs like SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, or Federal Public Housing Assistance.
- **Benefits**: The Lifeline program offers a discount of up to $9.25 per month on phone or internet services ($34.25 per month for households on Tribal lands).

### Non-Profit Organizations

Several non-profit organizations work to bridge the digital divide by providing free or low-cost smartphones to those in need. Some of these organizations include:

1. **PCs for People**: This organization offers affordable computers and internet services to eligible low-income individuals and families. They may provide refurbished smartphones at a low cost.
2. **Human-I-T**: This non-profit refurbishes donated technology and offers it to low-income individuals and families at little to no cost. They often have smartphones available for those who qualify.
3. **EveryoneOn**: Focused on connecting low-income families to affordable internet services and devices, EveryoneOn collaborates with various partners to provide discounted or free smartphones.

### Wireless Providers

Certain wireless providers offer free or discounted smartphones, including iPhones, through their participation in government programs like ACP and Lifeline. Some of these providers include:

1. **AirTalk Wireless**: Offers free or discounted smartphones, including iPhones, to eligible customers. Check their website for the latest offers and availability.
2. **Cintex Wireless**: Provides a range of smartphones at no cost to qualifying individuals. Visit their site to see if you qualify and what devices are available.
