Having access to a smartphone is essential to stay connected, access important services, and take advantage of opportunities. However, not everyone can afford the high price of a brand-new iPhone. Fortunately, government assistance programs like the Lifeline Program and the Affordable Connectivity Program provide qualifying individuals in the United States with a free government iPhone. These programs are part of the federal government’s efforts to bridge the digital divide and promote digital inclusion by offering smartphones to low-income households. Having a smartphone can open doors to communication, information, and opportunities that are critical in a digitally dependent world.

The Lifeline Program provides a discount on phone service for qualifying low-income consumers to ensure that everyone in the United States has access to essential communication services. Additionally, the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) contributes towards monthly internet service for eligible households. The convergence of these programs allows for greater technology access, thus facilitating digital inclusion.
