Domino’s Pizza, a popular choice for pizza lovers, has integrated the use of EBT at select locations as part of the Restaurant Meals Program (RMP). This program allows eligible individuals to use their SNAP EBT benefits to purchase hot, ready-to-eat meals, including Domino’s wide range of pizzas and other menu items.

**Understanding EBT at Domino’s**

EBT acceptance at Domino’s is currently limited to 60 locations, primarily in California. These outlets are part of the RMP, which is designed to help those who are unable to prepare meals at home due to age, disability, or homelessness. It’s important to note that EBT benefits are intended for food purchases only and cannot be used for cash transactions or non-food items.

**What You Can Purchase with EBT at Domino’s**

At participating Domino’s locations, customers can use their EBT benefits to enjoy a variety of menu items, including:

* **Pizzas**
* **Chicken dishes**
* **Sandwiches**
* **Pasta**
* **Bread sides**
* **Oven-baked dips**
* **Desserts**
* **Salads**
* **Drinks**
* **Extra sauces and seasonings**

It’s essential for individuals to manage their SNAP benefits wisely, as the RMP does not provide additional funds. To maximize the value of their benefits, customers are encouraged to look for coupons and discounts, which can often be found on Domino’s mobile app or website under the Coupons tab.

**Eligibility for Using EBT at Domino’s**

To use EBT at Domino’s, individuals must meet the following criteria:

* Reside in a state that participates in the RMP.
* Be unable to prepare meals at home due to specific circumstances such as age, homelessness, or disability.
* Purchase food from an authorized restaurant that accepts EBT.

If an individual meets all the necessary criteria, their caseworker should activate their card for use at participating restaurants. If there are any issues with using the card, it’s advisable to contact the caseworker for assistance.

**Finding Domino’s Locations That Accept EBT**

While each Domino’s location independently seeks government approval to accept EBT, not all stores participate in the program. Customers should verify that the Domino’s they plan to visit can process EBT payments. A comprehensive list of participating locations is available, organized alphabetically for easy reference.

**The Future of EBT at Domino’s**

Currently, only a fraction of Domino’s locations accept EBT, but there is potential for expansion. Several states are exploring the possibility of developing their own versions of the RMP, which could lead to more Domino’s outlets accepting EBT in the future. Pizza enthusiasts are encouraged to bookmark relevant pages and check back regularly for updates on EBT acceptance at Domino’s.

In summary, Domino’s participation in the RMP provides an opportunity for eligible SNAP recipients to enjoy their favorite pizzas and other menu items using their EBT benefits. By understanding the program’s guidelines and eligibility requirements, customers can make informed decisions and enjoy a satisfying meal experience at Domino’s.
