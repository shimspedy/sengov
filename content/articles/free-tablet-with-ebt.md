### How EBT/Food Stamps Recipients Can Get a Free Tablet and Internet

If you receive EBT or food stamps and want to get online, you might qualify for a free tablet with internet! This guide shows you how to get a free tablet and data plan through a government program.

#### T-Mobile Free Tablet with EBT via Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)

T-Mobile helps make internet more affordable through the ACP. This program offers EBT/food stamp recipients up to $30 off prepaid Metro and Assurance Wireless plans each month. You can also get a free tablet or smartphone with your discounted plan.

#### Eligibility Criteria for a Free Tablet with EBT

To get a free tablet with your EBT/food stamps benefits, you must:

1. **Be an active SNAP (food stamps) participant** with a valid EBT card. You need proof of current SNAP enrollment.
2. **Meet income limits** – your household income must be at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines based on your household size.
3. **Participate in other government assistance programs.** You may qualify if anyone in your household receives benefits like Medicaid, Federal Public Housing Assistance, Head Start, or LIHEAP energy assistance.
4. **Meet provider-specific requirements.** Some providers like Q Link Wireless or T-Mobile's Project 10 Million have additional criteria, such as living in an eligible state or meeting age/disability qualifications.

#### Documents Required

To apply for a free tablet, you’ll need:

1. **Proof of identity** (driver's license, state ID, or passport).
2. **Proof of residential address** (recent utility bill, rental agreement, or official mail).
3. **Proof of income** (pay stubs, tax returns, or a letter from your employer).
4. **A copy of your EBT card** as evidence of active SNAP/food stamps enrollment.
5. **Proof of participation in other qualifying programs** if applicable.

Gather these documents before starting your application.

#### How to Apply for a Free Tablet with EBT

While an EBT card doesn’t directly qualify you for a free tablet, you can significantly reduce the cost through the ACP. Here’s how:

1. **Check Eligibility:** You can qualify through EBT participation, income below 135% of the federal poverty line, or participation in other assistance programs. Verify your eligibility on the [ACP website](https://www.fcc.gov/affordable-connectivity-program).
2. **Choose a Provider:** Not all carriers participate in ACP. Look for providers like Metro by T-Mobile. Use the "Companies Near Me" tool or download the list of [participating providers](https://www.fcc.gov/affordable-connectivity-program).
3. **Apply for ACP:** Contact your chosen provider or visit their website to enroll. Provide proof of EBT participation or income documentation.
4. **Explore Discounted Device Bundles:** Once enrolled in ACP, ask about bundled plans that include a tablet. The ACP discount on your internet service can reduce the overall cost of a bundled plan with a tablet.
5. **Finalize the Application:** Complete your application for the chosen ACP plan with the bundled tablet option. You may need to pay a down payment or service activation fee, but the ACP discount should make it more affordable.

#### Available Tablet Models

Some of the latest models available for free with an EBT card include:

- **Samsung Galaxy Tab S8+ 5G**
- **Apple iPad 9th Generation**
- **Various iPhone models**
- **Older models like Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 or iPad Air**

Device availability varies by the specific program and provider.

#### Restrictions for T-Mobile Free Tablets with ACP

Before applying for a free tablet from T-Mobile through the ACP, note these restrictions:

1. **Annual recertification:** You must prove you still qualify for ACP benefits each year.
2. **One ACP discount per household:** You can’t get discounts for both mobile and home internet services.
3. **Primary residential address only:** The free tablet and discount must be used at your primary address.
4. **Non-transferable benefits:** You can’t give the free tablet and service benefits to someone else.
5. **Monthly usage requirement:** You must use the free tablet and service at least once per month to maintain eligibility.

By following these steps, EBT/food stamps recipients can get online with a free tablet and internet through the ACP.
