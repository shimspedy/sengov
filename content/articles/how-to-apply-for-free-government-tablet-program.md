### Free Tablet Application Process

**Step 1: Apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)**

Check the ACP’s requirements to make sure you qualify and click “Apply” on their website. Log in or create a new account and complete the online application. If you’re a Lifeline subscriber, reach out to your internet company directly to apply for ACP. You can also fill out an application form and a Household Worksheet and mail them along with your documentation to:
ACP Support Center  
PO Box 9100  
Wilkes-Barre, PA 18773

**Step 2: Provide documents that prove you’re eligible for the program**

Once you submit an online application, the website will ask you to share proof of your eligibility (unless you provide your Social Security number). Depending on your program, you may have to submit:

*Proof of income:*
- A state, Federal, or Tribal tax return from last year
- A current annual income statement from your job
- A Social Security statement of benefits
- An unemployment or worker’s compensation statement of benefits
- A Federal or Tribal notice of participation in General Assistance
- A Divorce Decree or child support award

*Proof of government assistance program or Tribal program participation:*
- A benefit award letter
- A statement of benefits
- A benefit verification letter
- A screenshot of the online benefits portal

*Proof of Federal Pell Grant:*
- An official financial aid award letter from the school or U.S. Department of Education
- A paid invoice that shows the student got a Pell Grant for the current award year
- A screenshot of an online financial aid portal

*Proof of free and reduced lunch or school breakfast programs:*
- Letter from the school or school district

To apply by mail, include these documents along with your application forms.

**Step 3: Submit your application to a participating internet provider**

Once you’ve been approved for ACP, submit an application to a participating program according to their guidelines. Depending on the company, you may have to provide additional information or documentation proving you receive a government benefit. Some companies may give you the option to apply online, by mail, or in person. Ask your company for more details. After submitting, stay informed about the progress of your application and note any deadlines or notifications you may receive via email.

**Step 4: Receive and set up your tablet**

If your application is accepted, the company will send you instructions on how to pick up your tablet—you might have to pick it up from a certain location or have it delivered to your home. Depending on the company, your tablet might come with apps for internet access, email management, financial management, or educational apps if the program is for students. The amount of time you have to wait to receive your tablet depends on the program. Ask your company when you might receive your tablet. Some programs offer device setup support on-location, over the phone, or online. Follow any instructions or guidance provided by the company to properly set up your tablet.
