#### Overview of New York's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in New York is a crucial resource that provides food assistance to low-income individuals and families, helping them achieve better nutrition and overall well-being. The program is administered at the county level, allowing for localized management that can address the specific needs of diverse communities across the state.

#### Program Administration

New York's SNAP program is administered at the county level, which allows for flexibility and responsiveness to local needs. Each county's social services department handles applications, eligibility determinations, and benefit distribution, ensuring that the program is accessible and tailored to the community it serves .

#### Reporting Requirements

New York employs both simplified and change reporting systems for SNAP households. Simplified reporting requires households to report changes periodically and when total countable income exceeds 130% of the federal poverty level. Change reporting mandates that households report certain changes in circumstances within 10 days of their occurrence. This dual approach helps balance administrative efficiency with the need to monitor household eligibility closely  .

#### Certification Periods

New York offers certification periods ranging from 4 to 24 months for households with simplified reporting requirements. This flexibility accommodates the varying circumstances of SNAP participants, allowing for longer certification periods for elderly or disabled households without earned income, thereby reducing the frequency of required interactions with the SNAP office .

#### Self-Employment Income

New York calculates the cost of doing business for self-employed individuals using actual costs. This method ensures that self-employed SNAP participants can accurately deduct their business expenses from their income, resulting in a fair assessment of their eligibility and benefit levels .

#### Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs)

New York mandates the use of Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs) for all SNAP households. This policy simplifies the process of calculating utility costs by using a standard amount, which is easier to administer and understand for both participants and administrators .

#### Treatment of Ineligible Noncitizens' Income

For ineligible noncitizens, New York counts all but a prorated share of their income and deductions when determining the eligibility and benefit amount for eligible household members. This policy ensures that the economic contributions of noncitizens are fairly considered without penalizing the eligible members of the household .

#### Child Support Payments

New York excludes legally obligated child support payments made to non-household members from the gross income considered for SNAP eligibility. This policy encourages the payment of child support by not penalizing the payer, thus promoting financial responsibility .

#### Drug Felony Disqualifications

New York does not impose a ban on individuals convicted of drug-related felonies, allowing them to regain eligibility for SNAP benefits without additional conditions. This inclusive policy helps to support individuals in their efforts to reintegrate into society and secure their basic needs .

#### Work Requirements and Disqualifications

SNAP household members aged 16-59 must comply with general work requirements, including work registration, job acceptance, and participation in employment and training programs if mandated. New York applies the minimum disqualification periods for noncompliance, ensuring a balance between encouraging employment and maintaining access to essential food assistance  .

#### Employment and Training Programs

New York offers both voluntary and mandatory participation in SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs, providing SNAP participants with opportunities to improve their job skills and employment prospects. These programs are tailored to meet the needs of the participants, helping them achieve greater self-sufficiency .

#### Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE)

New York adopts broad-based categorical eligibility, which extends SNAP benefits to households receiving non-cash benefits funded by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Maintenance of Effort funds. This policy simplifies the application process and broadens access to SNAP for low-income households .

#### Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA)

New York provides Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA) to households leaving TANF or state-funded cash assistance programs. TBA offers a fixed benefit amount for up to five months, allowing families to transition smoothly without the immediate need for extensive reporting, thus ensuring continued access to food assistance during a critical period .

#### Demonstrations for Elderly and Disabled Individuals

New York participates in the Elderly Simplified Application Project (ESAP), streamlining the application process for elderly and disabled households. This project includes extended certification periods, simplified verification processes, and waives recertification interviews, reducing the administrative burden on these vulnerable populations .

New Yorkâ€™s SNAP program ensuring that it meets the diverse needs of its low-income residents. Through thoughtful implementation of federal options and state-specific policies, New York continues to enhance the effectiveness and reach of SNAP, contributing to the health and well-being of its communities.
