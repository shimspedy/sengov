## Free Tablets for Low-Income Families: For School, For Work, For Life

Wouldn’t it be fantastic if you could get a tablet or computer for you and your family at no cost or a very low cost?

Access to the internet is essential in today's world. Whether it's sending emails, applying for jobs, checking the news, engaging in remote learning, or staying connected with friends and family, having internet access is crucial. While tablets are more user-friendly than phones for many daily tasks, the cost can be a barrier for many families.

Getting a completely free tablet for low-income individuals can be challenging, but there are numerous opportunities to acquire low-cost tablets and computers. Even more options are available if you have children in school.

### Why Affordable or Free Tablets Are Important for Low-Income Families

Before diving into where you can find affordable or free tablets, let's discuss why having a tablet is so important. A tablet can perform nearly all the functions of a computer while being portable. This means it can be easily shared within the household, allowing everyone to use it for their needs.

Children can use tablets for school and entertainment, such as TikTok or YouTube, while adults can search for and apply to job openings online. This is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, where applying online is often safer than in-person applications.

Moreover, many jobs now offer remote work opportunities. With a tablet or computer and internet access, you can work from home without needing to leave the house.

### Sources for Affordable or Free Tablets

#### Computer Technology Assistance Corps (CTAC)

CTAC is a donation-based organization that provides affordable desktop and laptop computers to low-income families, schools, and faith-based organizations. They refurbish donated computers and pass the savings to recipients.

#### Computers With Causes

Computers With Causes distributes donated computer equipment, including tablets, to individuals and families in need across the nation. Applications can be submitted on their website, with a turnaround time of thirty days. Note that accepting a donated computer might impact certain government benefits like SNAP and SSDI.

#### The On It Foundation – Florida

The On It Foundation aims to increase technology access for under-resourced households with children in K-12 education programs in Florida. Applications can be submitted via their website or at their physical locations. They also offer employment training and other resources.

#### Computers For Learning

Backed by the federal government, Computers For Learning supports schools and organizations by providing access to digital devices. This program is not for individual needs but can benefit schools that your children attend.

#### Computers For Kids – Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Utah

Computers For Kids provides low-cost tablets and computers to students or directly to schools and non-profit organizations. This program, which has no income requirements, offers additional discounts for low-income applicants. They refurbish donated equipment, ensuring it functions like new.

#### Interconnection

Originally servicing the Seattle area, Interconnection refurbishes donated devices and sells them at affordable prices. Their online store offers great deals, and most equipment comes with a one-year warranty. Stock changes frequently, so it’s worth checking back regularly.

### What to Consider

Before applying for these programs, gather necessary documentation such as proof of income, typically last year's tax returns. Some programs may require students to complete community service hours, so be sure to understand and document these requirements.

If the tablet is for school use, check the school's requirements, which might include removing social media apps and other features.

### Affordable Internet Access

Obtaining a tablet is only part of the solution; you also need a reliable internet connection. Many low-income families qualify for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which provides discounts on broadband service and connected devices.

By exploring these options, you can find the support needed to obtain affordable or free tablets and computers, helping your family stay connected and productive.
