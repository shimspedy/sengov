#### Monkeypox Facts for People Who are Sexually Active
Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by the monkeypox virus.
Monkeypox can cause a rash which may look like pimples or blisters, sometimes with a flu-like illness.
Monkeypox can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact including:

Direct contact with monkeypox rash, scabs, or body fluids from a person with monkeypox.
Touching objects, fabrics (clothing, bedding, or towels), and surfaces that have been used by someone with monkeypox.

Contact with respiratory secretions.

This contact can happen during intimate contact including:
Oral, anal, and vaginal sex or touching the genitals (penis, testicles, labia, and vagina) or anus (butthole) of a person with monkeypox.
Hugging, massage, and kissing.
Prolonged face-to-face contact.

Touching fabrics and objects during sex that were used by a person with monkeypox and that have not been disinfected, such as bedding, towels, and sex toys.
Having multiple or anonymous sex partners may increase your chances for exposure to monkeypox. Limiting your number of sex partners may reduce the possibility of exposure.
We are trying to better understand if virus could be present in semen, vaginal fluids, or other body fluids.
#### What Are the Symptoms?

You may experience all or only a few of the symptoms of monkeypox.
Most people with monkeypox will get a rash.
Some people have developed a rash before (or without) flu-like symptoms.
Monkeypox symptoms usually start within 3 weeks of exposure to the virus.
The flu-like symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle aches and backache, sore throat, cough, swollen lymph nodes, chills, or exhaustion.
If someone has flu-like symptoms, they will usually develop a rash 1-4 days later.
The rash may be located on or near the genitals or anus but could also be on other areas like the hands, feet, chest, or face.

The rash will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing.
The rash can look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy.
The rash may also be inside the body, including the mouth, vagina, or anus.
Monkeypox can be spread from the time symptoms start until the rash has healed, all scabs have fallen off, and a fresh layer of skin has formed. This can take several weeks.

Avoid sex or being intimate with anyone until you have been checked out by a healthcare provider.
If you don’t have a provider or health insurance, visit a public health clinic near you.
When you see a healthcare provider, wear a mask, and remind them that this virus is circulating in the area.
#### If You or Your Partner Have Monkeypox…
Follow the treatment and prevention recommendations of your healthcare provider.
Avoid sex or being intimate with anyone until the rash has healed, scabs have fallen off and you have a fresh layer of skin.
