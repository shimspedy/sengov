### How to Get a Free or Discounted Tablet with an EBT Card

If you have an EBT card and need a tablet, you might be eligible for a free or discounted device through government programs. This guide will show you the requirements and steps to get an iPad for free or at a low cost.

#### Process to Apply for a Free Tablet with an EBT Card

There are several ways to get a free iPad if you have an EBT card:

1. **Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP):**
   - This government program helps low-income households get internet access and connected devices. It offers:
     - A monthly discount on internet service plans that include tablets.
     - A one-time subsidy of up to $100 towards buying a device from participating internet providers.
   - Note: ACP doesnâ€™t directly give away free iPads but helps reduce the cost significantly.

2. **Lifeline Program:**
   - This program provides monthly discounts on phone or internet services.
   - While not all states offer free tablets through Lifeline, some do for EBT cardholders.
   - Check the Lifeline program website to see if your state provides this benefit.

3. **Non-Profit Organizations:**
   - Some non-profit organizations provide free or low-cost tech devices to those in need. Examples include:
     - **On It Foundation**
     - **Free Geek**
   - These organizations aim to increase access to technology, and they might help you get a free iPad.

4. **Educational Institutions:**
   - If you are a student, check if your school or library has programs offering free or discounted iPads.
   - Many institutions aim to bridge the digital divide by providing technology for educational or personal use.

By exploring these options, you can find a way to get a free or affordable tablet with your EBT card.
