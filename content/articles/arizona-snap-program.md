## Arizona's SNAP Program
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Arizona provides essential support to low-income individuals and families, helping them access nutritious food. The program, administered by the Arizona Department of Economic Security (DES), aims to alleviate food insecurity and improve the well-being of residents across the state.

### Program Administration
Arizona's SNAP program is state-administered, allowing for centralized management and consistent service delivery throughout the state. This centralized approach ensures that policies and procedures are uniformly applied, providing equitable access to benefits for all eligible households.

### Reporting Requirements
Arizona employs a combination of simplified and change reporting systems for SNAP households. Simplified reporting requires households to report changes periodically and when total countable income exceeds 130 percent of the federal poverty level. Additionally, households must report substantial lottery or gambling winnings and when able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) have work hours fall below 20 hours per week. Change reporting requires households to report certain changes within 10 days of their occurrence.

### Certification Periods
For households with simplified reporting, Arizona offers certification periods of both 12 and 24 months. Households in which all adult members are aged 60 or older or have disabilities may be certified for up to 24 months, while other households typically receive 12-month certification periods.

### Treatment of Self-Employment Income
Arizona uses a method other than actual costs to calculate the cost of doing business for self-employment income. This method helps streamline the application process and reduces administrative burdens on self-employed applicants.

### Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs)
Arizona mandates the use of Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs) for all households, simplifying the calculation of utility expenses and ensuring consistent treatment of these costs across the state.

### Treatment of Income and Deductions of Ineligible Noncitizens
For noncitizens ineligible due to pre-PRWORA (Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act) status, Arizona counts all their income and deductions when determining the eligibility and benefit amount for the household. Post-PRWORA ineligible noncitizens' income is counted, but only a prorated share is used for benefit calculations.

### Treatment of Child Support Payments
Child support payments made by Arizona SNAP participants are treated as an income deduction, encouraging compliance with child support obligations by reducing the payer's countable income.

### Disqualifications Related to Child Support and Drug Felonies
Arizona does not impose disqualifications related to child support non-cooperation or arrears. However, the state has opted for a modified disqualification for individuals convicted of drug-related felonies, potentially limiting the circumstances under which they can be permanently disqualified from receiving SNAP benefits.

### Work Requirements and Disqualification Policies
Arizona enforces the minimum disqualification periods for non-compliance with SNAP general work requirements but also disqualifies the entire household if the head of household fails to comply. This policy emphasizes the importance of meeting work-related responsibilities to maintain eligibility.

### Employment and Training Programs
Arizona offers SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs on a voluntary basis, providing support and resources to help participants gain skills and employment, thereby enhancing their economic self-sufficiency.

### Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD)
Arizona has obtained a statewide waiver for the ABAWD time limit, exempting ABAWDs from the requirement to work or participate in a work program for more than 3 months in a 3-year period if they are not meeting the work requirement. This waiver helps ensure that vulnerable individuals do not lose access to essential food assistance.

### Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE)
Arizona has adopted Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE), expanding access to SNAP benefits by aligning asset and income limits with those of other assistance programs, thereby simplifying the eligibility determination process.

### Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA)
Arizona offers Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA) to households leaving TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) or state-funded cash assistance programs. TBA provides continued SNAP benefits for up to 5 months, helping households transition smoothly as they adjust to changes in their financial circumstances.

### Demonstrations for Elderly and Disabled Individuals
Arizona participates in the Standard Medical Deduction (SMD) demonstration project, which allows the state to offer a standard deduction amount for medical expenses to households with elderly or disabled members, simplifying the application process and reducing administrative burdens.

### Combined Application Projects (CAP)
Arizona has implemented a modified Combined Application Project (CAP), streamlining the application process for individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) by using data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to determine SNAP eligibility and benefits, ensuring that eligible individuals receive timely and accurate assistance.

Arizona's SNAP program is designed to provide critical support to low-income households, ensuring access to nutritious food while promoting self-sufficiency through various employment and training initiatives. By leveraging state options and waivers, Arizona tailors its SNAP policies to meet the unique needs of its residents, enhancing the program's effectiveness and reach.
