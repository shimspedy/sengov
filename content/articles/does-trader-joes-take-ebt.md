## The History of Trader Joe's

Trader Joe's is a favorite destination for people who want fresh fruits, vegetables, and a variety of dietary options such as gluten-free, vegan, and organic foods. Knowing the history of the retailer can help you appreciate its journey.

The story begins in Los Angeles, California, in 1958 when Mr. Joe Coulombe founded Trader Joe's. Interestingly, Trader Joe's roots can be traced back to Pronto Markets, a chain store started by Rexall Drug Co. Joe Coulombe was in charge of the new division of convenience stores under Pronto Markets.

Joe Coulombe was successful, but he was worried about the competition from 7-Eleven. He decided to take his business in a different direction. He got the idea for Trader Joe's from Trader Vic's in Beverly Hills, a high-end restaurant.

Trader Vic's was expensive, and he wanted Trader Joe's to be more affordable. The first Trader Joe's opened in Pasadena in 1967 and has been growing ever since.

Trader Joe's is a comprehensive grocery store with a unique selection of foods. Mr. Coulombe passed away in 2020, but his legacy lives on.
