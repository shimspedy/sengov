## Who Qualifies for a Free Cell Phone?

###  Lifeline Eligibility

Are you struggling financially and wondering if you qualify for a free cell phone through the Lifeline program? This federal initiative helps low-income individuals stay connected by providing free cell phones and service. While there are some rules and restrictions, many people in need can benefit. 

### Eligibility Criteria for Lifeline Free Cell Phones

To determine if you qualify for a free cell phone and service, it's quick and simple. If you meet the eligibility criteria, you won't have to pay for the phone or the service. Here’s a detailed look at the qualifying criteria:

#### Participation in Federal or State Assistance Programs

Most individuals qualify for Lifeline through their participation in one or more federal or state assistance programs. These programs already assess financial need, simplifying the qualification process. If you’re enrolled in any of the following programs, you’re likely eligible:

- **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP/Food Stamps)**
- **Medicaid**
- **Supplemental Security Income (SSI)**
- **Federal Public Housing Assistance (Section 8)**
- **Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit**
- **Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance (BIA)**
- **Tribally Administered Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (Tribal TANF)**
- **Tribal Head Start (for households meeting income qualifying standards)**
- **Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR)**

States may also have their own qualifying assistance programs. For instance, MassHealth in Massachusetts and the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program in California qualify participants for Lifeline services.

#### Income-Based Eligibility

If you're not participating in any of the aforementioned programs, you can still qualify based on your total household income. The maximum income levels allowed vary, but generally, they are at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. Here are the income limits for most states, with variations for California, Hawaii, and Alaska:
