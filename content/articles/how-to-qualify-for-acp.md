### Whats the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) For ?

The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) was established in 2021 to help families stay connected during financial difficulties exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This government-funded initiative aimed to assist low-income households by providing discounted internet access, ensuring they could continue to work and study from home. Here’s a detailed guide on who qualifies for ACP, how to apply, and what to do now that the program is winding down.

####  how to Enrollment in ACP

**Purpose and Benefits**
- **Discounts:** ACP provides a $35 monthly discount on internet services, increasing to $75 for qualifying families on tribal lands.
- **Device Subsidy:** A one-time $100 stipend is available for purchasing a laptop, tablet, or desktop, provided the beneficiary contributes between $10 and $50.

**Impact and Funding**
- **Reach:** Since its inception, ACP has assisted 23 million U.S. households.
- **Budget:** The program had a $14.2 billion budget, which has since been depleted, leading to the wind-down period.

#### Qualification Criteria for ACP

To qualify for ACP benefits, households must meet one of the following criteria:

1. **Participation in Government Assistance Programs:**
   - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
   - Lifeline
   - Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
   - Medicaid
   - Federal Public Housing Assistance (FPHA)
   - Tribal assistance programs

2. **Income-Based Eligibility:**
   - Households must fall under the Federal Poverty Guidelines. Income thresholds vary by state, so it’s essential to check state-specific guidelines.

3. **School Program Participation:**
   - Households with children enrolled in free or reduced-cost school lunch programs may qualify.

4. **Pell Grant Recipients:**
   - Beneficiaries of the Pell Academic Grant during the application year can apply.

5. **Eligibility for Low-Cost Plans:**
   - Some internet service providers (e.g., Comcast, Spectrum) offer low-cost plans for which eligibility for ACP may apply.

#### Impact of ACP Wind-Down

The ACP program is winding down due to budget constraints. Key points for current beneficiaries include:

- **End Date:** No new enrollments after February 8th, 2024. Current enrollees will receive benefits until April 2024, with possible extensions depending on fund availability.
- **Transition Plans:** Beneficiaries should prepare to switch to low-cost plans or transfer benefits to other programs like Lifeline.

#### Recognizing the Wind-Down Process

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has outlined the wind-down process to ensure beneficiaries are well-informed:

1. **End Date Notification:**
   - The FCC will notify beneficiaries 60 days before the shutdown date.

2. **Opt-In Notification:**
   - Beneficiaries will be given the choice to opt in with their service provider to avoid unexpected expenses.

3. **Secondary Notifications:**
   - The FCC, in collaboration with the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (CGB), will issue at least three notifications within the last 60 days.

#### Benefits Transfers for ACP Enrollees

**Options for Current Beneficiaries:**
- **Switch to Low-Cost Plans:** Contact current internet service providers or explore other providers offering low-cost plans.
- **Transfer to Lifeline:** Lifeline provides low-cost or free mobile service and internet connectivity to low-income households. Similar to ACP, it is available to families already on certain benefit programs.

**How to Transfer:**
- Log into your ACP account and navigate to the "Manage My Benefit" tab for transfer details and eligibility checks.


The ACP has provided significant benefits to low-income households, offering discounted internet services and device subsidies. As the program winds down, it’s crucial for beneficiaries to explore other options like low-cost plans from various internet providers or programs like Lifeline to maintain connectivity. Stay informed about notifications and act promptly to ensure continued access to essential online services.
