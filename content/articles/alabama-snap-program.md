The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Alabama is administered at the state level. The program aims to provide nutritional assistance to low-income individuals and families, helping them purchase healthy foods and maintain a balanced diet.

#### Program Administration
- **Type**: State administered
  - The Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) is responsible for the administration of SNAP. The state agency handles the overall management and supervision of the program, ensuring compliance with federal regulations and policies.

#### Reporting Requirements
- **Type**: Simplified reporting only
  - Alabama uses a simplified reporting system for SNAP households. Under this system, households are only required to report changes in income, household composition, and other factors that might affect their eligibility or benefit amount at the time of their periodic review or if their income exceeds the gross income limit.

#### Certification Periods for Households With Simplified Reporting Requirements
- **Duration**: 12 months only
  - Households are certified for a 12-month period, meaning they must renew their eligibility every year. This ensures that recipients continue to meet the program's requirements.

#### Treatment of Self-Employment Income
- **Method**: Another method
  - For self-employed individuals, Alabama uses an alternative method to determine net income. This method includes considering actual business expenses and other allowable costs to calculate the net income from self-employment.

#### Standard Utility Allowances (SUAs)
- **Type**: Mandatory SUAs
  - Alabama uses a standard utility allowance (SUA) which simplifies the process of calculating household expenses related to utilities. This standard amount is deducted from a household's gross income when determining eligibility and benefit levels.

#### Treatment of Income and Deduction of Ineligible Noncitizens: Pre-PRWORA
- **Method**: Count all but a prorated share
  - For noncitizens ineligible prior to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), Alabama counts all of their income but prorates it to exclude the portion attributed to the ineligible member when calculating benefits for eligible household members.

#### Treatment of Income and Deduction of Ineligible Noncitizens: Post-PRWORA
- **Method**: Count all but a prorated share
  - Similar to the pre-PRWORA policy, income from noncitizens ineligible due to PRWORA is counted but prorated to exclude the portion attributed to the ineligible member.

#### Treatment of Child Support Payments
- **Method**: Child support income expense deduction
  - Legally obligated child support payments made to non-household members are treated as a deduction from the payer's gross income. This helps lower the net income considered for SNAP benefits, potentially increasing the benefit amount for the household.

#### Child-Support-Related Disqualifications
- **Policy**: None
  - Alabama does not disqualify individuals from receiving SNAP benefits for failure to cooperate with child support enforcement agencies.

#### Comparable Disqualification
- **Policy**: No comparable disqualifications
  - The state does not apply disqualifications from other federal, state, or local means-tested public assistance programs to SNAP recipients.

#### Drug Felony Disqualifications
- **Policy**: Modified ban
  - Alabama has modified the federal ban on individuals convicted of drug-related felonies. These individuals may still qualify for SNAP benefits under certain conditions, such as participation in a drug treatment program or meeting other specific requirements.

#### Work Requirements and Disqualification Policy
- **Policy**: Minimum disqualification periods only
  - The state follows the federal minimum disqualification periods for individuals who fail to comply with work requirements. Nonexempt individuals who do not comply are disqualified for 1 month for the first instance, 3 months for the second, and 6 months for the third.

#### Voluntary and Mandatory SNAP Employment and Training Programs
- **Type**: Voluntary
  - Alabama offers voluntary SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs. These programs provide job search assistance, job training, and other services to help SNAP recipients gain employment and improve their economic situation.

#### ABAWD Time Limit Waiver
- **Status**: No ABAWD time limit waiver
  - Able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) must meet work requirements to receive SNAP benefits for more than 3 months in a 3-year period. Alabama does not have a waiver in place to extend this time limit.

#### ABAWD Discretionary Exemptions
- **Status**: No use of discretionary exemptions
  - The state does not use discretionary exemptions to extend SNAP eligibility for ABAWDs beyond the federally mandated time limits.

#### Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE)
- **Status**: BBCE
  - Alabama has adopted broad-based categorical eligibility, which allows more households to qualify for SNAP benefits by aligning income and resource limits with those of other means-tested programs, such as TANF.

#### Transitional Benefits Alternative (TBA)
- **Status**: No TBA
  - Alabama does not offer transitional benefits for households leaving TANF or state-funded cash assistance programs. Households must reapply for SNAP benefits based on their current circumstances.

#### Demonstrations for Individuals Who Are Elderly and/or Have a Disability
- **Status**: SMD and ESAP
  - Alabama participates in the Standard Medical Deduction (SMD) and the Elderly Simplified Application Project (ESAP). These programs simplify the application and verification process for elderly individuals and those with disabilities, providing streamlined access to benefits.

#### Combined Application Projects (CAP)
- **Status**: No CAP
  - The state does not participate in Combined Application Projects (CAP) to streamline the application process for individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.
