# Using CalFresh and Benefits

You can use your CalFresh benefits at many different types of participating stores in person and online. Many businesses will post a public notice or sign indicating that EBT cards are accepted. Some pharmacies, like CVS and Walgreens, also accept EBT payment for eligible food items. Additionally, EBT cards can be used at some convenience stores, gas stations, farmers markets, and more. If you're unsure whether a food seller accepts EBT cards, you can look up the business using the online USDA SNAP Retailer Locator tool.

Check out the [SNAP Retail Locator](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/retailer-locator) to find physical locations where you can use your CalFresh benefits. You can also use the [SNAP Online Locator](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/online-purchasing-pilot) to find online stores that accept CalFresh benefits.
