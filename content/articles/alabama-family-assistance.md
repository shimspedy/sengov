#### how to apply for Alabama's Family Assistance Program

Alabama's Family Assistance Program is a state initiative that provides temporary financial aid to families in need. In this we will give you a thorough instructions of the program, including where to apply, the application process, necessary documents, eligibility, and more.

#### Understanding the Alabama Family Assistance Program

The Family Assistance Division of the Alabama Department of Human Resources manages the Alabama Family Assistance Program. The program is financed by the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. The program's main objective is to offer benefits and services to needy families, allowing children to be cared for in their own homes or those of relatives.

##### The program provides two key services to eligible families

- Temporary Cash Assistance: This service offers temporary cash assistance for basic needs to low-income families with children under 18 years of age or 19 years of age if they are full-time students in a secondary school or equivalent vocational or technical training.
- Work and Job Training Services: The JOBS Program offers work and training services to all parents receiving cash assistance to assist them in finding and retaining employment.

#### Eligibility for the Program

To be eligible for the Alabama Family Assistance Program, you must meet the following criteria:

- You must be a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident.
- You must be a resident of Alabama.
- You must be pregnant or responsible for a child under 19 years of age.
- You must be unemployed or underemployed with very low wages equal to or less than the payment standards.
