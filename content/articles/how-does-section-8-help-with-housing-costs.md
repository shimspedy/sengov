**Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8): A Guide for Low-Income Families, the Disabled, and the Elderly**

The [Housing Choice Voucher Program](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/710), commonly known as Section 8, is a federal initiative designed to assist [low-income families](https://www.benefits.gov/news/article/45/), the disabled, and the elderly in securing affordable housing. Participants in the program can select housing that meets specific program requirements and receive vouchers to help cover their rental costs. For more details on available resources and eligibility, visit [Benefits.gov](https://www.benefits.gov/).

## How Section 8 Assists with Housing Costs

Section 8 housing vouchers are managed by local public housing agencies (PHAs), which receive funding from the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)](https://www.hud.gov/). These vouchers provide financial assistance for rent and utilities, with the local PHA determining the amount of aid based on the family's income and needs. The PHA pays the landlord directly, while the participating family is responsible for covering at least 30% of their monthly income towards rent and utilities. Once eligibility is confirmed, the family and landlord sign a lease, and the PHA formalizes a contract with the landlord to handle the payments.

## Section 8 Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for Section 8 assistance, applicants must meet several criteria, including:

* **Income Level**: Families must fall within very low or low-income brackets, based on HUD's annual income limits for the area.
* **Family Status**: Households must meet HUD's definition of a family.
* **Citizenship or Immigration Status**: Applicants must be U.S. citizens or have eligible immigration status.
* **Student Status**: Independent students must meet additional criteria to qualify.

For more detailed information, refer to HUD’s [Housing Choice Voucher Program Guidebook](http://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PIH/documents/HCV_Guidebook_Eligibility_Determination_and_Denial_of_Assistance.pdf) or contact your [local PHA](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts).

## How to Apply for Section 8

To apply for a Section 8 housing voucher, contact your local PHA. Depending on the availability of funds, your application may be placed on a waiting list. For immediate assistance or further information, visit your [local HUD office](https://www.hud.gov/states).

## Additional Housing Resources

If you need further assistance, HUD provides a [Resource Locator Tool](http://resources.hud.gov/) to help you find local housing resources, including shelters and foreclosure prevention services. Additionally, [Benefits.gov](https://www.benefits.gov/) offers a pre-screening tool to identify potential government benefits for which you may qualify.
